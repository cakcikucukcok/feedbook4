      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;ldquo;People have told us that our book gives them hope.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Karen and Evan met online, neither of them had any intention of ever getting married again. And yet here they are, more than ten years later, together, happy and married.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;How My Husband Keeps Me Happy&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em&gt; is the true story of a husband who finds many ways to invest into his marriage. In return, his wife gives him a wonderful happy life.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this funny and heartwarming book, they share the methods that keep the foundation of their marriage joyful and self-sustaining.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You&amp;rsquo;ll find lots of examples of how they put fun and laughter into their daily lives, as well as easy and effective ways to communicate with each other.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What they have found is that keeping a marriage low maintenance is easy and rewarding: you have to invest your time, effort and energy in one another. In doing so, they both reap the benefits of a loving fulfilled marriage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;We have been given a second chance at happiness. Together we put effort into our marriage to keep it fresh and alive, as if we were still dating. Women, men and marriages don&amp;#39;t come with a manual but our book lays out what works for us.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;" />
