  <title>For the Love of Mac - Sandra Reed</title>
      <meta name="description" content="I read somewhere that while we cannot direct the wind we can adjust our sails, simple yet profound. It was a Thursday when I filed for divorce. I know because most memorable things seem to happen to me on Thursdays. I could not change the past, but I could do something about the future. It was definitely time for some adjusting.
Had I known what lie ahead, I may have given it more thought. Looking back on the last three years of singlehood I am amazed at the people, places and events that invaded my life, showering me with pleasure and pain.
My name is Mac and this is an account of my journey, my steps as a divorced woman that tested my sanity and sense of humor. It has been filled with unexpected turns and uncharted roads, but isnt that what life is? Ive learned to cherish the steps, knowing that most of us never realize our dreams or ever reach our destinations. Our steps may be thoughtfully planned and well calculated but most often were forced to take side steps, back steps or just go in circles as forces over which we have no control dictate. I know it is the journey and not the end that is significant and eagerly wait for what comes next." />
