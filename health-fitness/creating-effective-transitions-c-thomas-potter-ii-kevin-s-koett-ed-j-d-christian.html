  <title>Creating Effective Transitions - C. Thomas Potter Ii, Kevin S. Koett, Ed. J. D Christian</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;This book focuses primarily on elementary to middle school transitions. This book was developed with a two-fold premise: one, that educators and parents understand the role they play in meeting the basic developmental needs of individual students during times of transition; and two, that school leaders understand how critically important it is for organizations to create structured transition processes to better ensure student success before, during and after transitions that supports the growth and development of students. This book includes authentic scenarios that are research-based to help combat the barriers associated with the transitional moves elementary students may experience. The goal is that school organizations and institutions will work collectively to strategically develop district-wide and inter-agency (high school and college) transition plans to help students with these critical periods.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;" />
