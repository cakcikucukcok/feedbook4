  <title>My Greatest Challenge - Frank Kienast</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;911, what emergency situation do you wish to report, please? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, uhmI think I need to go to a hospital to be checked out. I was just getting ready for bed, and all of a sudden I found myself waking up, on the floor. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do you think you had a heart attack? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Im not sureIm not having any chest pain. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Okay, we will have an ambulance there shortly. Is the door unlocked? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No, its locked. Ill answer the door. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You might wish to go ahead and unlock it. That way they can get in if they need to. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Okay, will do. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rescue personnel recommend a place called the MAC Center (Mercy Hospital Ambulatory Care). It is only a couple of miles away. There they can do tests and recommend an appropriate hospital. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a police scanner listener, I am familiar with the transport procedure used by rescue personnel. What I hear the ambulance personnel say over their radio mike as the ambulance starts moving therefore sounds surreal to me. Were en route to the MAC center with a forty-eight-year-old male patient, starting mileage is  I cant believe that this time, I am the patient! Very scary thought.&lt;/p&gt;" />
