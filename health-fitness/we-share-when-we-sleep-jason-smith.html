  <title>We Share When We Sleep - Jason Smith</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This new and refreshing book provides a positive explanation to children who are separated from their parents for any period of time. We share when we sleep gradually leads to a conclusion of sharing parents who are overseas when the children are asleep. This story is narrated by two boys, Dylan and Kaiser, who have a very special way of creating a connection with the reader by relating to sharing a parent who is overseas too.  Perfect for military families, child psychologist, therapist, counselor, support groups, non-profits concerned with child separation anxiety, as well as any family who is faced with the complicated task of explaining being separated from their children. In addition to describing sharing when we sleep, the author has uniquely addressed various other types of sharing in this book such as sharing our environment, resources, family, friends, teachers, toys, food, feelings, and even their home." />
