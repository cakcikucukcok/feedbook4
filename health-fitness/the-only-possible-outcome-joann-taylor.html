  <title>The Only Possible Outcome - JoAnn Taylor</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Some people have all the luck, dont they?  Everything good seems to happen to them.  They lead a charmed life.  They never know what it is like to deal with tragedy.  But others arent so lucky.  Dark clouds seem to follow their every footstep, and they always seem to be dealing with a difficult problem.  
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
So it was for me  I was one of the unlucky ones.  But I was indeed fortunate, for I had a force with me that was not going to yield to the temptation that accompanies bad luck.  This temptation can make one feel helpless, as though all is lost. But the force can conquer any hopeless feelings that have been conjured by temptation.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Families radiate this force, and this book is a tribute to mine.  Through three personal trials, I have experienced their strength and support in my struggle to overcome.  It is my fervent hope and prayer that you will find some aspect of my story to relate to in reaching your own only possible outcome." />
