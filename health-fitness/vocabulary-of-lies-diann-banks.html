  <title>Vocabulary of  Lies - Diann Banks</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Vocabulary of Lies is designed to serve as a guide with explanation and demonstrations concerning the deception of lies. The short stories will incite learning and laughing. Identify and evaluate the case studies; comparison opens your door of understanding. And generate your own ideas from the personal scenarios given in the book.
I know your objective in life is to live happily as well as successfully. Once you are introduced or reacquainted with the many lies you encounter, you should be able to recognize, redirect, and correct what you need to create or maintain happiness and success in your life.
Lies are an Academy-award production moment for so many people. They pride themselves on being able to convince and persuade others to adopt their point of view, do what they want them to do, or simply believe them. 
You must be especially careful and critical when you observe others. It is evident that we must look out for number 1. If you do not take the time to practice good listening and body-language reading skills, just to name a few, you may become lost in a lie.
You will develop a keen sense of awareness, and it will become easier for you to choose between the lie, the truth, and what you choose to believe. 
We need one another; therefore, lets not build our trust on a lie." />
