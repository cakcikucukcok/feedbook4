  <title>The Whole Body Solution - Max Tuck</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;Do you want to achieve optimal health but are confused by the many conflicting recommendations? Is there truly one solution that has only benefits, not downsides, and in turn reduces the risk of succumbing to the diseases which are so prevalent in modern society?  And will this really combat the ageing process? Max Tuck believes that there is such a solution &amp;#150; the Whole Body Solution. In this compelling book, she elaborates not only on how to eat to support each of your nine body systems , but how all of these systems interrelate to synergistically create the level of health that everyone seeks, but which might hitherto have been elusive. Bringing together a scientific approach to nutrition and exercise with a deep interest in the mind-body connection, Max explains how, by taking care of each body system, everyone can reach their ideal weight, attain vibrant health and make concerns about ageing and degenerative disease a thing of the past, regardless of genetic predisposition.&lt;/div&gt;" />
