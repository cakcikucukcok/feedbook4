  <title>Monolith - Roy-David Woodward</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Monolith presents six highly unusual short stories by a former Hollywood writer who was approved by famous Cecil B. DeMille.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Marvelous House of Infinite Joy is a fictional love story based on fact. It tells the tale of Olympic gold medalist husband and wife Jami and Clint OConnell, exploring her death from cancer, her status as she demands to return to Clint, and her heaven.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Martine Salvatore tells the tale of a bitter private investigator and a martial arts pro team, with millionaire Ranch Meadows who just buried his murdered parents. A fortune of graphite deposits on Ranchs property reeks of deadly involvement. Martine and Ranch travel worldwide, dodging death and trying not to fall in bed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Immortality: The I Word explores what the Bible, Talmud, Koran, Sumerian codices, and science labs have in common. It considers contradictions in the Genesis story of the Garden of Eden and in E.din of Sumeria. A jealous alien fooled Moses using True Sources high tech? This is a robust reach into blasphemy or reality, revising reincarnation proofs along the way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sunrise shares inspirations to make your dayand probably your life. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In All Together Now: Together Now Lemuria and Atlantis go down, and seismologists come back to alert us. The ridiculed Planet X becomes clarified despite NASAs denials and air brushing games. A disaster that hits every 3,600 years is on course now, hidden by our suns glare. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Roy explores the writers enigma, something that he ran from for years. There were details prophesied about him by Irish, Scottish, and British prophets, as well as Nostradamus. Today millions say such a president must bring compassion back to government. Is this that man?&lt;br /&gt;
