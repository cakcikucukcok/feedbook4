  <title>Reclaiming Adoption: Missional Living Through the Rediscovery of Abba Father - Dan Cruver, John Piper, Scotty Smith</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Delight in God&amp;rsquo;s delight in you.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; One of the ambitious dreams that &lt;em&gt;Reclaiming Adoption&lt;/em&gt; and its authors share with the Apostle Paul is that when Christians hear the word adoption, they will think first about their adoption by God. This book is premised on the belief that behind the Parable of the Prodigal Son(s) is Scripture&amp;rsquo;s teaching on adoption. The story of the Bible is that God the Father sent his only true and eternal Son on a mission, and that mission was to bring many wayward and rebellious sons home to glory (Hebrews 2:10) in order to adopt them into his family. That is the Story behind the story of the Prodigal Sons.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; If Christians learn to first think about their adoption by God, and only then about the adoption of children, they will enjoy deeper communion with the God who is love, and experience greater missional engagement with the pain and suffering of this world. &lt;em&gt;Reclaiming Adoption&lt;/em&gt; can transform the way you view and live in this world for the glory of God and the good of our world&amp;rsquo;s most needy.&lt;/p&gt;" />
