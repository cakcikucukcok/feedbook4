SOLVE THE DIVORCE DILEMMA and get off the fence! Find out if your husband is a keeper and create a life you love&amp;mdash;with or without him!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This empowerment guide offers you an easy and effective step-by-step method to help you GET CLEAR, GET STRONG AND GET OFF THE FENCE!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Solve the Divorce Dilemma is not like other books on relationship advice. It is a roadmap for the journey from unhappily married to freedom and fulfillment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This self-discovery guide is packed with tools to power you up for the next step&amp;mdash;whether it is staying in your marriage&amp;mdash;as a wiser, empowered YOU&amp;mdash;or to divorce with dignity and confidence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The author guides you through the process with the loving care of a sister&amp;mdash;full of warmth, compassion and encouragement. You will benefit from the wisdom of a sister who&amp;rsquo;s intimately familiar with the pain of a struggling relationship as a wife, attorney and empowerment trainer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Solve the Divorce Dilemma will help you gain clarity and teach you how to:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Use active awareness to discover the traps that may have lured you into an unhappy marriage, so you can avoid repeating the same mistakes in the future.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Explore the negative beliefs and attitudes that keep you trapped in the relationship and master strategies to dissolve them.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Examine your marital dynamics, so you can understand what you need from a marriage.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Assess how your relationship measures up to your needs and whether you and your husband can build a satisfying life together.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Determine if you need couples therapy and how to find the therapist that&amp;rsquo;s right for you.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Find out if you&amp;rsquo;re in an abusive relationship and tap into resources for help with domestic abuse and ending your marriage safely.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Make peace with your past choices and their consequences, liberate yourself through forgiveness and create a future of unlimited possibility.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Make the decision to stay in your marriage or to get a divorce.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you decide to leave, Solve the Divorce Dilemma will support you in your divorce journey. The book explains how to:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Develop your exit strategy.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Build a winning support team.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Become your own best friend and cultivate self-love practices to nurture your mind, body and spirit during the divorce process.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Conquer the fears that paralyze you.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Help you find the divorce lawyer that is right for you.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Create your life intentionally from the inside out.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Move on with confidence and self-reliance.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WHO CAN BENEFIT FROM THIS BOOK&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
All readers &amp;mdash;married, single, women and men&amp;mdash;can benefit from the insights and empowering techniques offered in this book.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The book, however, focuses on issues that affect women in traditional marriages who are contemplating divorce.&lt;br /&gt;
It does not address issues particular to women who have been left by their husbands and are healing from breakup or infidelity. It does not address issues that may be unique to same-sex couples. It does not provide dating advice, and concentrates instead on getting you strong as an independent self before trying to enter into new relationships.&lt;/p&gt;
