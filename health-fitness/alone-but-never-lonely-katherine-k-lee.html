  <title>Alone...But Never Lonely: Katherine - K. Lee</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;If you think this book is about a battered woman who broke free and escaped torment, this book is not quite that. This is a story about a woman and her struggles while alone in the mist of traditional life events. Graduating high school, dating, getting married, staying married, and divorce all happen every day. These life experiences or the lack thereof are the stones cast into the water and the follow up decisions is the ripple.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;Not every relationship should progress to marriage and it is not a sad day for every marriage to end. This book documents what happens to most of us when we get ahead of ourselves and commit a lifetime to the wrong person for the right reasons. What happens when love dries up or perhaps reality is revealed and the person staring you in the face no longer seems to fit in your puzzle? You both now can&amp;rsquo;t look each other in the face, so it seems no better option then to be alone to work out the details.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Not every marriage created on earth is Godly appointed. In fact, many are done out of fear, impatience, and the desire to experience a wedding ceremony even if the only real thing is the expense. Life is full of twist and turns and no one knows the future. Marriage is our stab at believing in a perfect dream. We attempt to have a perfect marriage or union when imperfect people establish the union&amp;mdash;with prayerfully a perfect God at the center. Is there a solution for guaranteed success?&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;With the best of circumstances many find themselves alone. Alone in the marriage, alone because of divorce, alone because we didn&amp;rsquo;t settle or the other gave up. This series is for those who know they are not crazy. They gave their life, relationship or marriage their best and yet are alone. You can be alone but that doesn&amp;rsquo;t mean you are lonely!&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;When we, you are alone, it is time to date yourself, discover, and experience life with you! To start a new relationship or expect new life in an established relationship is to strive amiss without a renewed mind. We must learn who we are, be true to ourselves, and fight for what we want and need without settling.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;There are deal breakers we all should have and we should not be ashamed of them. If you are unable to stay with your spouse if they cheat on you, and you find they have. You are not a failure if you leave and honor your deal breaker. If you find that forgiveness is in your heart, forgive and be prepared to work like mad to get back whatever was lost. Neither of the two is weak if they are true to themselves.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The strength is in being true to yourself and making choices with your eyes wide open. I trust this book will encourage you to find yourself and remember there is value in being alone&amp;hellip;because you are never lonely.&amp;nbsp; Living alone allows the much-needed time for you to spend with you and remember why everyone in your mist must respect you&amp;mdash;even if they don&amp;rsquo;t like you today or ever.&lt;/p&gt;" />
