  <title>Creationist Diet: Second Edition Comprehensive Guide to Bible and Science Based Nutrition - Gary Zeolla</title>
      <meta name="description" content="What did God give to human beings for food? What does the Bible teach about diet and nutrition? How do the Biblical teachings on foods compare to scientific research on nutrition and the relationship of diet to degenerative disease like heart disease, cancer, stroke, diabetes, and osteoporosis? These and other questions are addressed in this book. 	This Second Edition is 2-1/2 times as long as the First Edition. This Second Edition also presents a different perspective on diet. The First Edition mostly advocated a vegan diet, while this Second Edition also advocates for a diet that includes animal foods. But, and this is very important, those animal foods are to be what are called &quot;old-fashioned&quot; meats, dairy, and eggs, not the &quot;factory farm&quot; products that most people eat. What is meant by these two terms and the incredible difference between them is explained in this book. 	Many more diet related topics are also covered, every subject imaginable about sound nutritional practices." />
