  <title>The Mosaic Principle - Nick Lovegrove</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;Life&amp;#151;personally and professionally&amp;#151;is lived to the fullest as a mosaic, encompassing a rich and complex set of diverse experiences that provide purpose, meaning, happiness, and success.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Yet, the pressures of modern society push us toward narrower focus and deeper specialization in our lives and careers. Our pursuit of specific expertise risks us becoming isolated from those different from us; our lack of shared experience fosters suspicion and conflict. Today we have businesspeople and government officials who persistently distrust and demonize each other; a fortunate swath of society with professional and financial security, increasingly isolated from those left behind; and community leaders who struggle to relate to and connect with the communities they serve. In every walk of life we have allowed ourselves to be pushed into self-defining cocoons from which it is difficult to break out.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Nick Lovegrove&amp;#39;s compelling vision provides the way out of this contemporary trap. He supplies vivid portraits of those who get it right (such as Paul Farmer, the physician whose broad and imaginative choices bring health and hope to the world&amp;#39;s poorest people) and those who get it deeply wrong (such as Jeffrey Skilling, the former CEO of Enron) and connects their experiences with a blueprint of six skills&amp;#151;&lt;I&gt;a moral compass, transferrable skills, contextual intelligence, prepared mind, intellectual thread,&lt;/I&gt; and &lt;I&gt;extended network. The Mosaic Principle&lt;/I&gt; will help you to succeed in an ever-changing, more complex, and diverse world, and build a more remarkable and fulfilling life.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/div&gt;" />
