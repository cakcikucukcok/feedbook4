  <title>How to Use God&#39;s Lifetime Warranty in Your Marriage - Dr. Amos Adeniyi</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The idea to write fictional letters to marital couples on how to use Gods lifetime warranty in their marriages came into being in the process of a sermon preparation as a guest pastor for a local church in November 2011. I prayed about which message to deliver for many days. About two days before Sunday, I had a dream that a young lady participated during my sermon. After the service, her family thanked me and said I made her speak in public for the first time and I gave her the encouragement that she needs for the rest of her life. Then I woke up.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;On the actual Sunday service, during the sermon, I asked the congregation how many of them had a dog or a cat. A young lady  a 17 year old said she had a cat. I asked if she ever took her cat for a walk, she said, no. I asked, why not? She replied, Nobody does! Then I said people take their dogs for walks, but this does not mean that dogs are more important or better than cats. Cats have their own usefulness. God who created us knows that we are not the same and that we cannot function in the same way. One should not be boasting that s/he is better than the other. After the service, the grandfather of the cat owner who spoke during my sermon and her aunt came to me and thanked me for the opportunity given to the young lady to talk for the first time in public, which would enable her to express herself publicly. When I was praying at home after the sermon, I had the feeling that God wanted me to tell people to try out what seems to be unusual for them.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;It has been my concern for many years that many couples dont take their wedding vows seriously. It is affecting children a great deal; many children have two or three stepparents. Those children without stepparents seem to be the odd ones among their peers. In Canada, about 50% of first marriages may likely end up in divorce. One may presume that the rate of divorce in second marriages would be lower, but instead it is higher at 72% while, third marriages have the highest divorce rate of 85% (Comparative Annual Divorce Rate in Canada). Similarly, in America, the first marriages divorce rate ranges from 41  50%; second marriages divorce rate is between 60-67% and third marriages is between 73-74%. (Information on Divorce Rate and Statistics).&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;This book is fictional. The stories are not real stories. They are about my past experiences with heterosexual couples in my counseling or pastoral care. I do not have a particular person or couple in mind. No names in the book are real names. If anybodys name or any couples have the same names as used in the book, I would like them to know that I am not telling their particular story or using them as an example. The Holy Spirit inspired the writers of the bible stories/ vii instructions/messages and the same Holy Spirit is still talking to us today. I believe, I was inspired to write the book. I will encourage anyone or couple whose story or stories are similar to whats in the book not to be too critical, but to take it (the book) as a means through which God is speaking to them to change. No marriage is too bad that God cannot change for better. Dont fold your arms and accept your troubled marriage as a done deal. I will advise the readers to call upon the author of marriage, God, through Jesus Christ, to fix their marriages. He is able.&lt;/p&gt;" />
