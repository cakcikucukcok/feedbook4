  <title>The Healthy Breast Guide: A 10-Minute Self Massage for Body, Mind and Soul - Katharina Wehrli</title>
      <meta name="description" content="A simple and quick-to-do technique for self-maintenance and prevention every woman should know and practice. It&#39;s relaxing and builds confidence in wellness rather than highlight fear and disease consciousness. Finding natural pathways to self-acceptance, breast massage combines with breathing, sounds and personal affirmations. With this guide you can practice in the privacy of your own home. Even just using the massage proper will add many benefits. Some of these are: increased circulation, shaping and firming of breasts, massage of whole body via reflexology, decrease in symptoms of PMS or menopause, relief of menstrual cramps, lymph flush, treatment and reduction of cysts, relaxation, early detection of abnormal tissue, balancing of sex drive, and beautification of skin.  If you add the breath, sounds and affirmations, you also receive the following and many other additional benefits: clearing of negative thoughts and emotions, personal health pledge, energy balancing, a sense of self-empowerment and growing conscious awareness. In a time where the female body is on the one hand idealized and on the other hand subject to serious health issues, this practice rebalances body, mind and soul." />
