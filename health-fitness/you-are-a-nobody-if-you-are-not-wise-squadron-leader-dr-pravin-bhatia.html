  <title>You Are a Nobody If You Are Not Wise - Squadron Leader (Dr) Pravin Bhatia</title>
      <meta name="description" content="There is so much poverty in the world because we were obsessed with knowledge. Every Holy Scripture from Bible to the Bhagavad Gita warns us against crowding the mind with knowledge. They all tell us that we must shift from knowledge to wisdom. Knowledge is just a range of information. It can be good or bad, useful or useless. The ability to choose knowledge as per objectives is the first step towards achieving wisdom. The creative use of correct choice of knowledge is its second step. The final step of wisdom is to persist till the objective is achieved.
The best place to achieve wisdom is in the class room. This is possible if teachers do not insist on teaching through lectures and testing children through examinations by forcing them to learn by rote like parrots. The teacher must ensure that the student learns by reading speaking, thinking, writing and listening in groups. The teacher must become a facilitator in the process of learning. This will create vibrant and wise children who will make our mother earth a great place to live in.
This book tells you how this can be achieved by the students. It also tells you how you can replicate the steps provided by the book for learning by students in acquiring wisdom in your own lives." />
