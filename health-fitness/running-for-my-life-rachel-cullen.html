  <title>Running For My Life - Rachel Cullen</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Throughout her life, Rachel Cullen followed a simple yet effective route straight to mental health misery. Suffering from bipolar disorder, and hungry for approval at any price, she settled for flunked relationships, an ill-fitting career, and poor health to match. Whilst mindlessly seeking a utopian vision of &#39;normality&#39; that she was mis-sold and so desperate to achieve, the solution seemed increasingly illusive.
Stuck in this endless cycle of disappointment with her life, and not knowing how to handle the strain of her mental illness, she put on a pair of old trainers. She&#39;d never been able to think of herself as a &#39;runner&#39;, and the first time she forced herself out the door, she knew it would hurt. Everywhere. She just didn&#39;t realise how much it would heal her, too.
Interspersed with Rachel&#39;s real diary entries, from tortuous teen years to eventually running the London Marathon, Running for my Life will make you laugh, cry, and question whether you really can outrun your demons." />
