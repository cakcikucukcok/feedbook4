  <title>The Road to Recovery - Rocky Atkinson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;It&amp;rsquo;s late at night, maybe early morning. The convulsions have stopped and the hospital says I&amp;rsquo;m stabilized enough to leave. They want this addict out but I want out more. The walk home is long and I move slowly. Thoughts of detox and recovery, square one and starting over. I&amp;rsquo;m not me, not by a long shot.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These are the comments of one man but they are similar to those of hundreds of thousands of other men and women battling the disease of addiction. Relapse, detox, recovery, relapse, detox, recovery. And so it goes. They want to tame the demons of drugs and alcohol that rip them apart. They want to reclaim their lives.&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;The Road to Recovery&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;offers the hope and encouragement they beg for and deserve. In changing from lives of despair where drugs are almighty and darkness prevails, they come to believe in a true and powerful God who offers grace, mercy, love and forgiveness. A caring God who works wonders and offers peace, joy and contentment. And in serving and glorifying Him, comes salvation, an eternal life far more glorious than anything imaginable on earth. Through over 60 contemporary pieces of art, positive bible verses and writings and other touching and sometimes hard edge comments about life in recovery,&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;The Road to Recovery&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;delivers what we desire and need.&lt;/p&gt;" />
