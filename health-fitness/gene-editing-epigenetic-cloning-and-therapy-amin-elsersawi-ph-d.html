  <title>Gene Editing, Epigenetic, Cloning and Therapy - Amin Elsersawi Ph.D.</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This book is really helpful for someone who wants to start learning about genes and DNA. It is a well-written book describing all the introductory materials one would need to become current with genomes and genomics topics. It begins with an introduction to DNA and genes in chapter 1 and goes on from there through epigenetic in chapter 2, including acetylation, methylation, ubiquitylation of protein, deimination, and proline isomerization. It goes through gene editing in chapter 3, which includes good description of TALENs, ZFNs, and CRISPR/Cas systems. Chapter 4 includes cloning using artificial embryo twinning, somatic cell nuclear transfer, and asexual reproduction. Chapter 5 is about the material on basic stem cells of embryonic stem cells and adult stem cells. Chapter 6 discusses techniques and technology of gene therapy and cloning therapy. Chapter 7 includes descriptions on cell division, mitosis, meiosis, biological life cycle, parthenogenesis, bacterial conjugation, DNA fingerprints, genetic relationship between individuals and surname studies. 
The book includes many diagrams and a glossary and an index. For a serious book on DNA and genes, this book is quite readable. It is a user-friendly textbook so that many readers will find it helpful to read some chapters more than once. The book is a valuable introduction to the extremely important field of genes and genomics." />
