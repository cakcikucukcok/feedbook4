  <title>Real Calm - Psychologies Magazine</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;b&gt;Let &lt;i&gt;Psychologies Magazine&lt;/i&gt; show you the path to a calmer, happier life&lt;/b&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Real Calm&lt;/i&gt; is your guide to getting rid of stress for good. The unrelenting demands of everyday life never stop, and stress is a natural byproduct of modern life; you cannot change that, but you &lt;i&gt;can&lt;/i&gt; change your response. &lt;i&gt;Psychologies Magazine&lt;/i&gt;, the leading magazine for intelligent people, explores stress, calm and the spectrum in between to show you how to cope. Packed with tips, ideas and expert insight, this book draws on cutting edge global research to help you understand your brain&#39;s response to stress and build real calm into your everyday life. What does life look like when you&#39;re calm? What are the obstacles standing in your way? How is stress affecting you right now? Let the experts guide you to the answers you need, and start living better today. &lt;p&gt;Everyone knows that stress is bad for your health, relationships, productivity and quality of life — but how can we avoid it? The answer is we can&#39;t — we can only temper our response, use the stress as a tool or make it go away. This book shows you how, with clear, helpful advice and a real-world focus on the little things that have a great impact on your day-to-day. &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;Explore what real calm means to you&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Learn what&#39;s standing between you and your peace of mind&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Identify your stressors and develop a self-care plan&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Deal with the big things, and let the little things go&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;Motivational, inspirational and highly practical, &lt;i&gt;Real Calm&lt;/i&gt; is your roadmap to a happier, healthier, &lt;i&gt;calmer&lt;/i&gt; you." />
