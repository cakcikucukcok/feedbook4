  <title>Mindfulness Made Easy - Maureen F Fitzgerald</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Are you frazzled and stressed?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Join the millions of others benefitting from this scientifically proven method for calming your thoughts and emotions while living fully in the present moment. &lt;strong&gt;Mindfulness Made Easy&lt;/strong&gt; is a collection of best practices based on the work of experts such as Jon Kabat-Zinn, Pema Chodron, and Daniel Siegel. A great introduction to mindfulness, it includes easy tools to reduce stress and create calm, including how to:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;calm your &amp;ldquo;monkey mind&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;eat mindfully&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;relax by breathing deeply&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;scan your body and release tension&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;meditate without sitting on a pillow&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Select one each day or practice with others, share them with your friends and family, use them in the classroom or keep them in your office desk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Fitzgerald says, &amp;ldquo;When people pay attention to their body, their thoughts and their emotions, they wake up to a totally new way of understanding themselves and interacting with the world in amazingly positive ways.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Praise for this book&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Beautiful and thoughtfully written. A must read for anyone interested in starting a mindfulness practice.&amp;rdquo; ?Jeena Cho, attorney and author of &amp;ldquo;The Anxious Lawyer&amp;rdquo; (ABA) &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.theanxiouslawyer.com/&quot;&gt;www.theanxiouslawyer.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Maureen gives us a wonderful collection of practical mindfulness techniques. Each one makes you eager to discover the next one. As a teacher of meditation, this book will be a welcome recommendation to my students.&amp;rdquo; ? Wendy Quan, workplace meditation instructor &amp;amp; organizational change manager, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.thecalmmonkey.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;www.TheCalmMonkey.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;This is a truly wonderful set of exercises for developing mindfulness. I am very impressed with your ability to bring together so many ideas and make it accessible...the format is great: What it is. How to do it. What to notice.&amp;rdquo; ?Darrell Joan Tomkins, professor emeritus and artist&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;If you only have five minutes a day, like me buy this book, try one exercise each day, and you will not only be calmer, but more awake to all of life!&amp;rdquo; ?Monica Beauregard, president, Bridgepoint Human Resources, Toronto&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Doctors, counsellors and educators can use these powerful tools personally and professionally. Maureen has made mindfulness accessible! ?Susie Lang-Gould, MA, RCC, Director of Peace Portal Counselling Centre&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;In a surprisingly short book, Fitzgerald has managed to pack in a remarkably practical and comprehensive collection of practices. She had done us all a great favour in scouring the works of great teachers, extracting the core practices, and making them eminently accessible. A wonderful guide to practice. ?David Tunnah, Management Consultant&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot; Very powerful stuff for those wishing to see more, do more, in life. We will use this book in our Studios to reduce client stress and to help clients with the right mindfulness approach.&amp;quot; ? Peter Ormesher, CEO and Founder, Reach Studios of Massage &amp;amp; Well Being&lt;/p&gt;
