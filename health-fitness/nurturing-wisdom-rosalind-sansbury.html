  <title>Nurturing Wisdom - Rosalind Sansbury</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Nurturing Wisdom: Daily Inspiration to Be All You Can Be presents a valuable guidebook and a useful tool to use on a daily basis for encouragement. Select a page and read the words as a focus for your day to align with the light, love, and wisdom that resides within you. Nurturing Wisdom provides assistance for all those times when you are going through stress, fear, or pain, and find yourself in need of support. You dont have to suffer alone.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Sometimes all we need to reconnect with the wisdom and centre of love that resides within us is a nudge to reconnect, to remember, and to become empowered. Author Rosalind Sansbury has offered 365 thoughts that serve as just that inspiring little push. From thoughts on being brave to encouragement to do all things with passion and joy, she gives us the chance to reflect on the idea that will continue us to move us along on our journey of life.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
BE BRAVE&lt;br /&gt;
enough to do what sits right&lt;br /&gt;
WITHIN YOUR HEART!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Often we know something we&lt;br /&gt;
choose isnt in harmony with ourselves,&lt;br /&gt;
but we choose it to please others.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
When this occurs,&lt;br /&gt;
we do everyone a disservice,&lt;br /&gt;
not honouring our authentic selves.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
HONOUR&lt;br /&gt;
