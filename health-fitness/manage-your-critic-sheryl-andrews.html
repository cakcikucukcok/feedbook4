  <title>Manage Your Critic - Sheryl Andrews</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Your critic (that little voice in your head) often has lots to say and can impact every thought and every decison you make, resulting in self-doubt, feelings of guilt and fear of failure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With easy to apply models and principles you will soon understand why some people don&amp;#39;t listen and how that impacts your ability to gain clarity and confidence in your next best step.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Author Sheryl Andrews shares her own heartbreaking story as an entrepreneur and mother . Like many she&amp;nbsp;was keen to make a difference and so she worked hard to&amp;nbsp;grow her business. But that meant she was distracted, frustrated and not really&amp;nbsp;listening to the people that mattered.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Then one day her 16 year old daughter decided she would rather be homeless than stay at home. This book&amp;nbsp;is her story of how she managed her critic through that difficult time and went on to reconcile with her daughter and grow a successful business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And it is a&amp;nbsp;practical guide to develop the skills, support and resources you need to work and live at your best with others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sheryl Andrews - also known as The Strength and Solution Detective struggled for years to know what she wanted, other than for everyone else to be happy. She became sensitive to criticism and built up barriers to keep herself safe. Then&amp;nbsp;she discovered those same barriers were preventing her from hearing what she needed to grow and develop.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When she decided to train as a coach she learned to&amp;nbsp;change the way she listened. Step by Step she was able to listen to the critic inside and out without becoming emotionally overwhelmed. This gave her the ability to ask questions and be curious. It is her hope that the&amp;nbsp;stories and activities&amp;nbsp;in this book will empower you to&amp;nbsp;do more of what you love and ditch the critic that says you can&amp;#39;t.&lt;/p&gt;" />
