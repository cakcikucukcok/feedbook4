  <title>Save Yourself from Burnout: - Marnie Loomis, Beth Genly</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Running On Empty? Get Your Life Back&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Save Yourself from Burnout: A System to Get Your Life Back&lt;/em&gt; provides the road map of a new, easy-to-use, personalized burnout recovery system. After experiencing burnout themselves, the authors, Dr. Marnie Loomis, a naturopathic physician, and Beth Genly, a Yale-trained specialty nurse-practitioner, boiled down hundreds of medical and sociological studies to distill out key answers to these critical questions: Why do some people burn out while others do not? What protects us from burnout? What makes us vulnerable? How can we stay far away from burnout in the future?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Loomis and Genly&amp;rsquo;s book explains how burnout happens and how it is different (and worse) than stress. It gently but thoroughly debunks many harmful social myths around burnout. Throughout this friendly, often humorous book, readers discover self-tests, reflection exercises, and visual tools designed to enhance their learning and support their individual recovery. Central to the system: a unique &amp;quot;Burnout Shield&amp;quot; self-assessment, in which the reader maps their personalized recovery plan, based on the individual shape of their 5 areas of burnout protection and vulnerability. An appendix cites extensive sources and references.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Q: &amp;quot;Does having burnout mean I&amp;#39;m weak?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A: No! Burnout can happen to anyone. Learning what to do can help you feel better, fast.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Q: &amp;quot;I&amp;rsquo;m exhausted. I want a manageable system that&amp;rsquo;s right for &lt;em&gt;me&lt;/em&gt;.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A: You got it! You&amp;rsquo;ll create your Burnout Shield, a simple visual dashboard that focuses on your needs. No more one-size-fits-all advice. Focus on what you&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;need and what works. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Q: &amp;quot;Do you understand how frustrating burnout is?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A: Yes! We&amp;rsquo;ve been there. We share some of our own experiences as we help you find your way out as well. Our research-based system has helped many people out of burnout, and it can help you, too.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />
