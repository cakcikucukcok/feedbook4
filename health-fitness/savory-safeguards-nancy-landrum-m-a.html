  <title>Savory Safeguards - Nancy Landrum M.A.</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Love Potions for Healthy Relationships
Nancy Landrum has written a series of transformational books that deliver gigantic wallops of insight.  Each volume in the series covers a particular ingredient present in a healthy relationship.  These powerful truths will demystify how healthy relationships work.  Her wisdom is harvested from a passionate, lifetime search for the secret to loving and being loved.  The examples from her years of relationship coaching make reading these volumes engaging as well as inspiring.  Each chapter ends with perceptive recipes to help the reader add that particular ingredient to his or her love potion.
In Savory Safeguards, the third volume of her Love Potions for Healthy Relationships series, Nancy Landrum maps out simple and effective strategies for safely managing the strong emotions that sometimes derail otherwise loving relationships.  By her own examples, she delivers abundant hope that anyone can learn to make his or her emotions work for them rather than see out-of-control emotions damage or destroy personal peace and treasured relationships.  In addition, Savory Safeguards outlines a simple but powerful plan for resolving differences so that all parties have their core concerns satisfied.  The delightful outcome is that issues stay resolved, rather than resurfacing when the solution breaks down.  Since all relationships have issues, Savory Safeguards is an essential component for any healthy relationship.
Overpowering emotions? Recurrent problems? Nancy Landrum, M.A., reveals how to break the painful cycle of hurt in this 3rd volume of her Love Potions for Healthy Relationship series, Savory Safeguards. By following the simple steps outlined in this book, one has the keys to rebuilding themselves and their relationships with lasting change.

We love this book! As you read Savory Safeguards, youll become enchanted by Nancys ability to teach a relationship concept clearly and concisely, and then tell a story which not only grabs you, but also illustrates the concept perfectly! There is so much here to help protect and grow a healthy relationship, from research-based strategies for managing strong emotions, to practical steps for finding solutions that work, to inspiration and encouragement for those who feel like theyre the only ones working at the relationship. We heartily recommend reading- and savoring -  this book!

I often hear couples say, We just dont know how to communicate. I beg to differ, I think couples are definitely communicating, but how they are communicating is impacting their relationship in a profound ways. Nancy Landrum has done a fabulous job of breaking down how couples can communicate in a way that builds up their relationship instead of tearing it down. LOVED the way she incorporated the tools all of us need to help marriages thrive!
