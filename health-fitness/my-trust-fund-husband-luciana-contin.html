  <title>My Trust Fund Husband - Luciana Contin</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P class=MsoNormal style=&quot;MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt&quot;&gt;Laura, a female version of Fieldings Tom Jones did what she had to do with feisty, unquenchable determination to attain her happy ending. Be warned! It is not a tale of virtue rewarded! Its rather an honest faithfully detailed, picturesque odyssey of a long walk on the wild side. Thats what fascinated me. This is how a woman walked her road following her instincts and wits! There are women who live their lives outside the lines who seem to be the stuff of mens fantasies. If you have wondered what their motivations are and whats in their hearts, Lauras most intimate revelations will enable you to walk miles in her shoes. That gorgeous woman vivaciously tossing her hair over a luscious meal in an outrageously expensive restaurant, her slightly mismatched date devouring her with his eyes in anticipation: Whats up there? Find out for yourself!&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal style=&quot;MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt&quot;&gt;The fast pace of the story and the quotes from familiar classics like &lt;I style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-style: normal&quot;&gt;Jane Ayre&lt;/I&gt; and the &lt;I style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-style: normal&quot;&gt;Doll House&lt;/I&gt; that precede each chapter hinting whats next work well! There are lots of travel stories and people anecdotes, and the sense of a vivid acquaintance with a lively Italian family over decades. And theres a great how it ended closure chapter about the men in her past.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal style=&quot;MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt&quot;&gt;If you can suspend yourself from judging Enough to appreciate this tales frankness there are many insights to be had here. It seems to me this book could get some good discussions going, especially between men and women or across generations!&lt;/P&gt;" />
