  <title>The 15 Sins in Manufacturing Excellence - Raghunath V. Reddy</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The 15 Sins
in Manufacturing Excellence
The Path To Overcome And Excel
From the Authors desk..
To achieve excellence in their chosen field is a common dream of most professionals  including those in the manufacturing and service fields. But for most, this remains a dream.
This is mainly because in todays competitive world, few people are selfless enough to share their success formula with industry brethren and the corporate world at large  for fear of losing out on their own position in the marketplace.
We have seen and heard of many fantastic ideas but unfortunately, very few great implementations. This book bridges that very gap between theory and execution. The 15 Sins in Manufacturing Excellence  The Path to Overcome and Excel, is our Grand Recipe that has been meticulously developed  based on our own learning cycle over many years of industry experience  from grassroots to delivery of final end product and service. We learned how, where and when to apply what we felt worked best for companies and employees. Through this book, our intention is to just share with you our own humble, yet challenging experiences that working life has taken us through.
This book rests in the premise that if you get your basics right, follow the guidelines outlined herein and overcome the 15 sins enumerated; you are bound to have a Holistice, Systems Approach Roadmap of Proven Strategies for Growth, Peak Performance and Consistently Improving Results  with an added bonus of a checklist for your day-to-day operations! You will achieve Excellence in your Manufacturing Operations and exceed your own expectations Its as simple as that!!
It is a MUST read book for all  whether you are a fresh graduate entering the real world at large or someone who is already working in the industry  including, inter alia, Supervisors, Team Leaders, Monitors, Executives, managers, Directors, Vice Presidents, presidents and even the COO or the CEO of the company  in short, it encompasses every employee working for or running the organization. Thats the implicit power of this book!!
Thank you." />
