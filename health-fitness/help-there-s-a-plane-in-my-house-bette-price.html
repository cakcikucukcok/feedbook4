      <meta name="description" content="Few people have had an actual airplane crash into their house. But Bette Price did.

After being displaced from her home for ten months and hurdling one challenge after another, the author realized that she had discovered some very important lessons about dealing with stress throughout the whole process. She also realized that metaphorically, we all have planes crash into our houses. It just manifests in different forms. With this realization, she decided to share her story of the ordeal and the lessons she learned in hopes that the things that got her through this very stressful time would be of help to others as well.

Theres a Plane in My House is a short easy-to-read, gift-sized book that begins with a synopsis of the fateful event and shares twelve easy tips for dealing with stress, each one supported by the authors own personal experience. These simple yet useful tips helped the author through a very difficult time. She believes they can help you as well." />
