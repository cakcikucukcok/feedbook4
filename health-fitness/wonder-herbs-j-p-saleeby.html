  <title>Wonder Herbs - J.P. Saleeby</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This book explores the properties and health benefits of three important Adaptogen Herbs and introduces the reader to its research proven uses in medicine.  The health claims made on Rhodiola rosea, Eleuthero (Eleutherococcus senticosus) and Jiaogulan (Gynostermma pentaphllum) are substantiated in detail by extensive scientific references.  
This book is not too technical for the average reader, but detailed enough for the medical practitioner interested in becoming acquainted with these herbs.  The book details history, the role of herbs in maintaining health and fighting disease, bioactive components, typical doses, side effects and toxicity.  This book remains a great reference on these three herbs.
Dr. Saleeby was the founder of Vita SanusTM Formulations (Vita Sanus Nutraceuticals)   (1998- 2006.  Held the company until it was sold to Dr. Trevor Neil, DPM in 9/2006)

He was the chief formulator and consultant for SSN, Incs PREGAME Tennis and PREGAME Golfers formula sports enhancement dietary supplements launched in April 2004.  He was asked to come up with a unique formula for AdapTX Labs CadioFactor and PreFight line of supplements (2007-2008).  As chief formulator for Ovion BioPharma/ Pharlian Labs he put his knowledge to use in formulating a subfertility/infertility herbal cycle pulse product (2008-2009).  Some of the herbs discussed in this book have found their way into these formulations.
Dr. Saleeby already a medical consultant for the Aerobics &amp; Fitness Association of America (AFAA) became in late 2008 the medical/nutritional consultant on the advisory board of BeachBody / Product Partners during their new launch of a meal replacement shake (Shakeology).

In 2015 Zimetry (www.Zimetry.com) was launched with three other partners and Dr. Saleeby remains a principal and chief medical officer for this direct to consumer lab and wellness (eCommerce) site.
