  <title>In Search of Happiness - Ashok Gulla</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P align=justify&gt;Every person has a right to be happy, no matter in whatever condition he or she is placed in life. Happiness does not come automatically nor does it remain with us for all the time. It requires nurturing with a right attitude and better understanding of our goals in life. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P align=justify&gt;Sometimes, people have attitudes and hold certain beliefs that bring a lot of pain and turmoil in their lives. The search for happiness starts with re-examining issues that bring us trials and tribulations. A simple way to have a fulfilling life is to love others. Loving others requires care, understanding, tolerance and patience. Family, relations and friends are a source of steadfast support and bring purpose to our lives. In today&#39;s world, wealth, professional status and society have a lot of influence on our well being and happiness. People feel wealth or professional success alone is sufficient to provide happiness; often, thereby losing balance in life. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P align=justify&gt;People talk about religion and spirituality that provide different perspective of human life. Each person is spiritual in essence and has inner spiritual needs to be fulfilled, to achieve peace, calmness and long term happiness. Spirituality helps us to resolve many of the problems of life, provided we take it with faith.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P align=justify&gt;We can bring happiness in our lives through having better values, understanding and a positive outlook. This book deliberates on each aspect of life, be it love, attitude, family, society, profession, wealth, health, religion and spirituality, and discusses instances where we tend to err in our understanding. The focus of this book is to raise awareness of these issues so that readers can understand the relevance of these issues in their lives; and realize that current perception and outlook needs re look.&lt;/P&gt;
