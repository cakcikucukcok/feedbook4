___	Pallbearers and Honorary Pallbearers chosen and notified
___	Florist notified and floral arrangement(s) ordered for services

	Funeral Home Name will only schedule Chapel or Church Services with three and a-half hour intervals to ensure that every family is given the proper amount of time needed. Graveside Services can be scheduled with three hour intervals.
	When services are scheduled, the time of year and place of final disposition will determine the latest a service will be set to ensure safety for family, friends and staff.
	It is very important to consult with the Funeral Home Staff and Clergy before final decisions on services are set.
The emotional element of death that your family has to manage can be over whelming.  Complete this work book prior to a death or after a death before starting your journey to answering What Do I Do Now" />
