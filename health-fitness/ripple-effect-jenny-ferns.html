  <title>Ripple Effect - Jenny Ferns</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The ripple effect of World War Two, good, bad and ugly, spread far and deep in Britain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Veronica, feared she would be too old to marry or ever bear children until she met Richard a handsome RAF pilot. He persuaded her to marry before he went to war. She was jealous when her sister Rachel produced an illegitimate child from an unknown father.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Blitz bombing from the Germans left much of the London in ruins. Before the onslaught, Veronica arranged for the evacuation of Rachel&amp;#39;s daughter Susie, to live with her in the country. Rachel was presumed killed by a bomb in the Blitz so Susie grew up thinking Veronica was her mother and the absent Richard her father.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Veronica, similar to many other women left alone, learned new survival skills with the deprivation of rationing. She learned to love Susie as her own. Loneliness, with war-forced separation from her husband, took a toll on her.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the war ended Richard returned to a wife and an adopted child he barely knew. They struggled to adjust to each other. Richard&amp;#39;s alcoholism and outbursts of aggression, as side-effects of battle fatigue (PTSD), began to alienate Veronica and Susie.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Susie grew up strong, clever, and free-spirited but afraid of boys and afraid of Richard. When Susie, age seventeen returned late from an evening out with her platonic boyfriend. Richard struck her in anger. She suffered a concussion and began to hate her father.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Emotions ran high when Rachel, Susie&amp;#39;s long-lost mother showed up. Veronica was delighted to discover her sister alive. Susie was devastated with the revelation of the secret of her biological mother and the secret of her adoption. In fury, she left home.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Veronica despaired when the family appeared to disintegrate. Veronica gave her husband an ultimatum to clean up his drinking and his anger, or she would divorce him. This precipitated his suicide attempt. He undertook treatment for addiction, depression and battle fatigue (PTSD). He began to heal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The truth emerged about Richard&amp;#39;s issues, and Veronica&amp;#39;s and Rachel&amp;#39;s guilt and secrecy. Compassion for each other softened the anger. The family began to reconnect and forgive. Susie, an opinionated teenager began to accept but not forgive. Thus a sequel.&lt;/p&gt;" />
