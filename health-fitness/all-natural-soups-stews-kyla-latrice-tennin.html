      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Sometimes you need to give your body a rest from what you have been eating regularly, such as meats, especially those that take quite a bit of time to digest and to rid the body of toxins that came in through certain foods eaten. And in this book I discuss how I lost 170lbs, beat obesity twice and sculpted an eating and overall nutrition plan.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Here are some of my favorite healthy soups and stews recipes that I have created to help you get the food rest you need, whether for a day, week or even month; to enjoy &amp;quot;other&amp;quot; foods and ways of cooking. Variety in life is good.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;For Cooking, you can either utilize a slow-cooker, crock-pot or a boiler on the stove. Within this book, to make sure everyone has the utensils needs, you can simply use a boiler pot on a traditional stove (whether electric or gas; gas cooks food more evenly and thoroughly). Enjoy!&lt;/p&gt;" />
