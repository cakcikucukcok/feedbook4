  <title>The Challenge of Changing Your Life - Clara  Stella Arenas, Mirna Pineda</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Economic and social pressures have absorbed us in such a way that we have forgotten to live. Instead, we confine ourselves to surviving. We work without enjoying, we eat without tasting, we speak without communicating, and we ride through life accepting and generating destructive and painful relationships. The worst thing about this is that we have become accustomed to living like this, and we believe that we should continue that way. The good news, which brings us this work, is that nothing compels us to live that way; and we have the right and the ability to change our destiny. 
Obviously, one of the main needs for human beings is education. But I am not referring solely to academics; I also refer to learning to live, education for everyday. We need to learn what urges us, as a society and as individuals, to know and to recognize ourselves in order to modify behaviors, which constrain us, and produce suffering to those around us and ourselves. 
The Challenge of Changing Your Life is not just a stop on the way to reflecting on life, happiness, our relationships, past, present, future and mainly about ourselves. It is rather a repair and maintenance workshop which we can use to align and fix ourselves and then return to the path with another perspective, anew vision and tools to correct any damage that may arise during the rest of our journey." />
