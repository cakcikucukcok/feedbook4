  <title>The Color of the Sunset - Marie Masters</title>
      <meta name="description" content="A memoir that looks at the authors relationships as seen through the art of Claude Monet. The Color of the Sunset makes a gesture toward Impressionism and toward impressions of a life viewed near the end of middle age. Marie Masters successfully braids her own history with Monets legacy of beauty, love and light. These two elements contrast each other, creating an energy that wouldnt exist if either were presented alone.
For anyone who has ever wondered about life beyond divorce and failed relationships, here is a realistic but hopeful story about trying again. 
* Explore how relationships factor into lifes metamorphosis.
* See how art expresses the most fleeting, transformative moments.
* Experience the heartache and the bliss of searching for love.
This memoir presents the authors relationships to various men and to the paintings of Claude Monet in thoughtful and interesting ways. Masters awakens insights into herself and courageously reveals some of her own flaws as well.
