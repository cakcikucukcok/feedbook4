  <title>Special Needs and Legal Entitlement, Second Edition - Melinda Nettleton, John Friel</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Fully updated to include the most recent developments in law and practice, the second edition of this comprehensive and straightforward guide to the legal rights of children and young people with special educational needs clearly explains the key issues in a complex system.
Helping parents to understand the legal entitlements of their child, Nettleton and Friel explain the new Education, Health and Care Plans which have replaced the Statements of Special Educational Needs. They explain what an Education, Health and Care Plan is, how assessments are carried out, and how annual reviews, amendments, rights of appeal and tribunals work in practice. They also include help with 42 of the most common problems encountered, a discussion of relevant cases, extracts from the official published guidance issued, and a draft Reasons for Appeal.
This essential handbook for parents of children with special educational needs will also be a key reference for teachers, charities, Local Authority officers, and lawyers in other fields." />
