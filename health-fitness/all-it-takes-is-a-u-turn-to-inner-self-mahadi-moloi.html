  <title>All it takes is a U-turn to inner self - Mahadi Moloi</title>
      <meta name="description" content="On our journey to our God-ordained destiny, we often get tempted to drift away from our designated paths and then take highways and byways that we were not supposed to take. We then end up lost, hurt, disappointed, moving around in circles and getting further away from our destiny. When you feel lost and far away from your destiny or Creator, check your ways and the paths you have followed. No matter how far you have travelled, make a U-turn, your Creator is waiting expectantly with open arms to welcome you back. He will never question where you come from. He will never judge what you have done. Instead, He will offer you a resting place for your troubled and broken soul. All that He wants is for you to say &amp;quot;God, here are my broken pieces. Please help me to put them together again, for You are the One Who created me and therefore know which piece belongs where, and You also know where other pieces have fallen.&amp;quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;No matter where you are&lt;br&gt;No matter what happened to you&lt;br&gt;No matter when it happened&lt;br&gt;No matter how far you have travelled,&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;Come and let us return to the Lord, for He has torn (that which is evil in and around us) so that He may heal us: He has stricken (the devil that leads us astray) so that He may bind us up.&amp;quot; Hosea 6:1&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;" />
