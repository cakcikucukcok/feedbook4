  <title>Water: the Universal Healer - Guy Proulx</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Water: The Universal Healer&lt;/i&gt; shares the lifesaving message that with adequate clean water, the body heals naturally and that the effects
of many common health complaints can be alleviated with proper hydration. Author Guy Proulx began lecturing on hydration before it
became popularhe witnessed its success among his massage clients. He makes the vital point that of all the mammals on this planet,
humans are the only ones who drink anything but water once they are finished nursing. Educating and teaching individuals about how the body works has always been his most powerful healing tool. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Earth consists of more water than land mass. Water gives life to the whole planet and every living being on it. Consider these three amazing facts about water:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; There is not one thing on Earth that water cannot break down. Even diamonds, in time, are no match for water.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Th ere is nothing that water will not clean or dilute. Water is the universal solvent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; There is absolutely no living organism on the planet that does not depend totally on water for its healing powers and lifegiving nourishment to survive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Water: The Universal Healer&lt;/i&gt; speaks to the fact that to intentionally deprive your body of water is tantamount to embarking on a slow,
insidious, and premature death.&lt;/p&gt;" />
