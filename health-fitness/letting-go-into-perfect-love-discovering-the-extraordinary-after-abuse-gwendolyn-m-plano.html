  <title>Letting Go into Perfect Love: Discovering the Extraordinary after Abuse - Gwendolyn M Plano</title>
      <meta name="description" content="As a college administrator, Gwen Plano lived her professional life in a highly visible and accountable space-but as wife and mother, after hours and behind closed doors, she experienced the daily terror of domestic violence. It was her secret; it was her shame. But when her husband turned his brutality on her son, she could no longer stay quiet.  In Letting Go into Perfect Love, Plano recounts her experiences as the victim in a twenty-five-year abusive marriage, and as a survivor who came out of that relationship determined to start over, artfully depicting the challenges and triumphs of balancing the obligations of motherhood and career with her family&#39;s healing process. Alternately heart-wrenching and joyful, this is a story of triumph over adversity-one woman&#39;s inspiring account of learning how to forgive the unforgiveable, recover her sense of self, open her heart, and honor the journey" />
