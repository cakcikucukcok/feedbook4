  <title>Day-Day&#39;s Dream - Doris Tanner Ross</title>
      <meta name="description" content="As the owner of Doris Tanners Flowers, Inc., at the age of eighty-eight years old, Doris Tanner Ross decided to fulfill the request of her many friends and family over the past years to tell her story.  The story begins in 1924 in Sullivans Hollow.  She had many struggles during the depression era as a war widow with a baby to raise.  With God as her guide and her mother as her support, Doris made many decisions that would adversely affect her future and the future of her daughter.  
Doris is currently still working and running her own business.  She opened her shop in 1965 and relocated her business in 1996.  Doris still strives to please her wonderful customers.  She attributes her success to treating people the right way, just as God would want her to.  
Although her customers appreciate her for her talent, her grandchildren and great grandchildren love her as their Day Day!  In their eyes, she is most famous for her Sweet Potato Pie!  No matter what path one has crossed with Doris Tanner Ross, she will be remembered as someone special. 
Philipians 4:12-13 I know how to be poor and I know how to be rich, too.  I have been through my initiation and now I am ready for anything anywhere:  full stomach or empty stomach, poverty or plenty.  There is nothing I cannot master with the help of the One who gives me strength. (New English American Translation)" />
