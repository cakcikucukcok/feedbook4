  <title>The Power of the Heart and Hands of a &quot;Cna&quot;Certified Nursing Assistant - Pamella D. Gordon</title>
      <meta name="description" content="My day started, by a briefing and review of my days assignment, There must be a passion to work with seniors and people with some type of disability, when my assignment seems to be a world of burden on my shoulder, I approach it with a smile, and when a client / consumer smiles back at me in appreciation it just makes my day. My approach to my job, is not just a job, or for my salary,it is the love I have for these people. My late father told us,hard work does not kill anyone, I thought about this statement and came to the realization that not only did my father work hard, but he also worked smart, by hiring employees. Personally, I had to work. I  approached every one with an act of love. Whether servicing a client or helping an associate, it must be with willingness,and love, thats the only way I could make it thus far. I did not know I would make it for a week, now its 16 years. Start your day with a prayer to God, and a smile." />
