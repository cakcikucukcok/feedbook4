      <meta name="description" content="The book,
Omega 3 and vitamin D secrets!
How do you obtain a healthy level of Omega 3 and vitamin D these days?
contains new information about an old discovery made by a doctor in biochemistry in the USA in the 1940s. With his research he discovered why most people do not get much health benefit from the meals with wild fish, free range eggs, grass feed beef and fish supplements.
For whatever reasons his important discovery and solution to obtain a healthy level of Omega 3 and vitamin D plus the other lipids has remained a secret to most people.
With his research, the doctor discovered that very little of the important lipids in marine oil or food rich in these lipids would reach all the cells in the skin and body with the normal method of eating and drinking.
Already at that time it was noticed that a lot of people got dry skin and body with the associated illnesses. These days some doctors involved in the research of these important lipids think we have reached a worldwide vitamin D deficiency of epidemic proportions with more than 1 billion people at risk for associated illnesses. 
As soon as you understand how our modern way of life have influenced our digestion, absorption and transport of the essential fatty acid Omega 3 and the oil soluble vitamin D in the body, compared to previous generations, it should be easier to understand why many people get dry skin and body these days. With this knowledge, it should also be easier to understand what you need to do to obtain a healthy level of Omega 3 and vitamin D together with the other oil soluble vitamins to correct or avoid dry skin and body, and the associated illnesses.
What are these associated illnesses?
According to scientific research lack of these important lipids cause oxidative stress or inflammation at the cellular level. Most of our serious illnesses related to heart, arteries, arthritis, osteoporosis, lung, asthma, diabetes, kidney, eyes, cancer etc and the not so serious illnesses such as dry ski, dry hair, bleeding gums, depression, digestive problems, pain, hearing loss etc seem to develop because of oxidative stress or inflammation at the cellular level. 
Add fertility problems, autism and birth complications and... 
What is a healthy level of these important lipids and how can I be sure that I have a healthy level of these lipids?
This is what the doctor in biochemistry discovered back in the 1940s. 
With this information your starting question could be: 
What changes have we made to our way of living and eating compared to previous generations which give us lack of the essential fatty acids Omega 3 and the oil soluble vitamin D? 
That information and much more is the topic of the book!" />
