  <title>Savor the Flavor &amp; Get Twice the Luv - Jamala M. Johnson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Pink Passion: A ruling passion motivates, pushes, stretches, encourages, inspires and in some instances a ruling passion might even challenge you to reach your full potential. Make no mistake about it, a ruling passion is much different from a goal. In general, a goal is a set deadline or time frame estabish by the goal setter to complete and accomplish a particular task. Normally, goal setters classify goals into categories, short term and long term. For a tantamount of consumers and shoppers, once a goal is set it stays at the center of attention until the goal is accomplished. Totally different from a goal___putatively, a passion, so to speak, is something that you love to do more than anything else that you do daily. Straight forwardly speaking, when you have a passion it consumes your every thought, it pretty much paints the picture of how you view, see, and live life. A strong feeling, longing, or desire;each of us as consumers and shoppers have different passions__ostensibly, even with the various passions available as choices, some consumers and shoppers have not found their ruling passion, understandably, it could take years before a consumer or shopper stumbles upon their ruling passion. At any rate that you find your passion, a passion or a ruling passion could be just about anything that you love and enjoy to do at home, away from the job, on vacation and during holidays. From shopping to blogging to cooking to singing to acting to dancing, it&#39;s what you love to do the most, it&#39;s what motivates, pushes, stretches, encourages, inspires, and challenges you, it&#39;s your ruling passion. In previous years, I have had a passion to try and do many things. While in college, I rediscovered my passion for the English language and writing. Within the past seven years, I developed a passion for shopping and blogging. 2009, I developed a passion for pink. Along with my passion for pink, I believe my ruling passion is to be an award winning editor and writer. Veritably, all passions begin with you_if you have found your ruling passion stick with it, share it, and create a niche for your passion. And for the percentage of you (consumers and shoppers) who you havent found your ruling passion, start_right now and start doing what you love and enjoy, it&#39;s not too late.&lt;/p&gt;" />
