  <title>Achieving Your Bucket List - Mary Reggie</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Through this book I hope to influence you and give you the ropes of how to go about making your bucket list and achieving them as you journey through different stages in your life. I took my life time to do this and you will probably take a long time to complete them too.  You may have done some of what I have accomplished but nevertheless there is so much you can learn from my experiences.  
If you have not heard of the term bucket list it is a list of everything you want to achieve in your lifetime comprising of dreams that you want to fulfil.  We all dont go about waiting for things to happen; we plan and we create our personal goals and plans.
Good luck, and here we go." />
