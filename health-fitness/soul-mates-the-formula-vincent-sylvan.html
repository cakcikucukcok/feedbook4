  <title>Soul Mates - the Formula - Vincent Sylvan</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Vincent Sylvan&lt;/b&gt; has created a formula using astrological influences as a guidepost for finding ones soul mate. This formula gives the readers action steps on how to narrow their search along the way, to identify this mystical person that Vincent believes we all have. These are methods the author has tested and applied himself on his own quest in finding his soul mate. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After many years of research, his first marriage for seventeen years, not being able to succeed, he experienced divorce and failure. This triggered him to find the answers more than ever before, and past the prime of his life, Sylvan had an awakening and developed the formula to find his other half of his soul, the only person who can inspire him to be a better person and take him to greater heights than he could have ever dreamt of by himself or with any other woman. &lt;/p&gt;
P&lt;p&gt;utting into practice the secret to his revelation, he finds her on the Internet, the hardest place to find his soul mate, to put his formula to the test. The results surpassed his expectations. Vincent realized once more the importance for everyone to find their soul mate, to live a life of wonders. That is why he created this book.&lt;/p&gt;
