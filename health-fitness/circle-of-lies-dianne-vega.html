  <title>Circle of Lies - Dianne Vega</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Each one of us becomes the protagonist of our life story and we must have a part in the saying of its ending. In Hope&#39;s life there are memorable times both happy and sad that no one can remake or delete. The panorama consists of life lessons that include personal suffering and growth. There are overlapping layers of Hope&#39;s story of betrayal, denial, confusion, lies, and destiny. Her life is infused with memories, feelings,thoughts, and emotions of anger,torment, tears of sorrow and tears of laughter with the unconditional love she had even in the midst of abuse and depression. The circle of lies taught Hope the importance of self-confidence, self-dependability for her well being  and happiness, courage with fear, pride, humbleness,  self-worth,faith, and fortitude. On the train tracks where she once halted, she tried to go backwards to avoid the unforeseen stop but the day came when the only way was to go around in order to move forward with whatever was left after the wreck. Join me on an unforgettable journey that you or someone you know may have crossed at one point or another. Through the eye of the mind and the window of the soul you shall experience this journey. May thoughts take place, may tears escape, and may smiles unfold with melancholy but  most of all reach hope with me through the circle of lies. There were easy lies, complicated lies, and hard truths that Hope had to go through with tattered wings which made it so difficult. The truth is the life goes on even in the time of destruction when Hope&#39;s future dreams were taken away and she didn&#39;t believe her life would be turned upside down by the love of her life who turned out to be an enemy. She learned the lesson of betrayal and saw lives shattered and new ones rebuilt." />
