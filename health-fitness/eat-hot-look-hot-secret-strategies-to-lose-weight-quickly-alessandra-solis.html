  <title>EAT HOT...LOOK HOT™, Secret Strategies to Lose Weight Quickly - Alessandra Solis</title>
      <meta name="description" content="#1 International Bestseller reveals a revolutionary approach to losing weight and burning fat without giving up any of the foods you like.&lt;br /&gt;
Continue eating what you like to eat in the amount that satisfies you; it&amp;#39;s what you add into your diet - rather than what you subtract out of it - that makes all the difference to your weight and overall appearance.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Everyone knows that weight-loss requires burning more calories than you take in. This can be accomplished the hard way: you could restrict your food intake one way or another and work out harder to burn extra calories and stored fat. Or, you can choose to lose weight the easy way: by eating certain foods and spices - alongside your regular meals and snacks - that are scientifically-proven to boost your metabolism, curb hunger and burn off excess fat.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Why make life more difficult by focusing on what not to eat?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
EAT HOT...LOOK HOT provides an easier and more effective way to burn fat and maintain your ideal weight.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;EAT HOT...LOOK HOT has the power to alter the gold-standard for dieting and permanently transform lives, both physically and psychologically&amp;quot; (Brad K. Cohen, MD, American College of Surgeons).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Former journalist and International Bestselling Author Alessandra Solis has pored through groundbreaking studies for the next revolution in healthy eating. And now she&amp;#39;s here to share those findings and ingredients with you!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
In EAT HOT...LOOK HOT, you&amp;#39;ll discover:
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;A step-by-step plan for taking back your body and regaining your self-confidence&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;How to convert stubborn white fat to brown fat for easier oxidation and accelerated weight-loss&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Which combinations of food help you supercharge your metabolism and keep weight off for good&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Delicious recipes to incorporate fat burning ingredients into your eating routine&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Bonus materials and guides to help you make the most of the program, and much, much more!&lt;/li&gt;
