  <title>The Disciplined Mind - Carl Adam</title>
      <meta name="description" content="You may have certain mindsets that you may not be aware of that can get in the way of you becoming a more disciplined person. That&amp;#39;s right. You might be sabotaging yourself because you hang onto certain ideas, assumptions or expectations that can undermine your progress towards greater levels of self-discipline.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I&amp;#39;m going to teach you how to become more disciplined on a practical level. This ebook is short on theory and speculation. Instead, it&amp;#39;s focused on taking every opportunity you have on a day to day basis and making the best out of them to develop discipline.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Discipline is closely related to how well you do in life. This is not something that you pick up to solve some sort of problem, and then promptly drop. Instead, this is a key part of you that you need to invest a proper amount of time, effort and energy in, which will continue to pay dividends long into the future." />
