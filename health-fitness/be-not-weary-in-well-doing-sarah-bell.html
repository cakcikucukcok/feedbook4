  <title>Be Not Weary in Well-Doing - Sarah Bell</title>
      <meta name="description" content="I often cry when I read parts of my book. Sometimes it was so difficult and I loved the kids so much. This is far from a How To book. I had no qualifications in child raising. I just wanted single parents to know that they are not alone, and to offer lots of encouragement and love.
Raising well loved, healthy children is a great challenge for even two parents who are strong and love each other. Raising children as a single parent can be an overwhelming task. I felt compelled to write this book to tell you that you can do it. I made many mistakes, but somewhere, somehow something worked, and I have two wonderful kids who make me proud to be their mother. We had very little money, but we had so much love. Together we made it happen. We grew together, we worked together, we snuggled and read for hours together. Raising kids is like planting a garden. We sow the seeds and we water with lots of love. One day we reap what we have sown and we are blessed to see the wonderful adults our children have become. 
I wrote this book to encourage you to be not weary in well doing. Do not despair. Love your children and create a loving environment. Do not hesitate to put your dreams aside temporarily. Your time will come and it will be special because your own child may be your best support and encouragement." />
