  <title>Ask the Silence - Love Story, Sarah Aschenbach</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;This book was born out of my desperate need for answers, combined with my refusal to accept things as the were, or &amp;quot;appeared&amp;quot; to be. The answers started to come in the most unusual way and they were so definitive and so clear that I never once questioned them. I have been asked, &amp;quot;how can you be sure this isn&amp;#39;t just your imagination?&amp;quot; I absolutely &amp;quot;know&amp;quot; it is not my imagination, but I don&amp;#39;t really know how I know; I just know! I received answers in which I&amp;#39;ve never had even the beginning of a thought of before. In the very beginning it felt like I was dying while still alive. As you will learn from &amp;quot;Ask the Silence&amp;quot;, this was not my first experience with this, but it was the first in &amp;quot;this way&amp;quot;; the first being spoken to. There was never even one verbal word in this conversation; as I explain in &amp;quot;Ask the Silence&amp;quot;, it is like being injected with liquid thought, where you instantly know, without any questions. There is a feeling of immense peace and love that has been serving as confirmation that what I am being told, &amp;quot;without words&amp;quot;, is absolutely true. And I want you to absolutely know that this is not reserved for certain people only. You not only can do this, you already are, in ways you don&amp;#39;t yet recognize. Allow me to help you do this, on purpose.&lt;/p&gt;" />
