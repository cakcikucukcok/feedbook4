  <title>The Alpha Woman Meets Her Match - Sonya Rhodes, Susan Schneider</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Relationship therapist Sonya Rhodes&amp;#39;s liberating, straight-talking guide convincingly argues that successful modern women&amp;#8212;the audience who embraced &lt;em&gt;Lean In&lt;/em&gt;&amp;#8212;can find the right guy without having to change or settle, and tells them how to do it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the twenty-first century, women are outpacing men in education and career advancement. Yet amazingly, successful women constantly hear that their professional achievements doom their chances of marriage and family.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Don&amp;#39;t believe the alarmist hype, advises top relationship therapist Dr. Sonya Rhodes. Today&amp;#39;s Alpha women&amp;#8212;ambitious, self-assured, and hardworking&amp;#8212; aren&amp;#39;t going to end up lonely spinsters. They don&amp;#39;t have to settle for Mr. Good Enough. Echoing Sheryl Sandberg&amp;#39;s powerful message, &lt;em&gt;The Alpha Woman Meets Her Match&lt;/em&gt; shares the secret necessary to triumph in love and work: find the right partner. It can be done&amp;#8212;and Dr. Rhodes has the tools to help.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Going beyond value judgments associated with the terms Alpha and Beta, she advises women to look past the overly competitive, domineering Alpha male for a man who&amp;#39;s in touch with his inner Beta qualities&amp;#8212;someone who is communicative, responsible, thoughtful, and collaborative. Demonstrating that most people are a combination of both sets of qualities, she includes a revealing test to help readers define where they (and their partners) are on the Alpha-Beta spectrum.&lt;/p&gt;" />
