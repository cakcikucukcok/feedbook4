  <title>You Can Make It with the Help of God, You&#39;ve Got to Make It - Minister Rita Hunter</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This book, entitled You Can Make It with the Help of God, Youve Got to Make It, is inspired from growing up in Savannah as a child. The many ordeals that I encountered strengthened my faith in God and brought me to the realization that I could make it through anything with the help of God. I learned from childhood to adulthood that there was nothing too hard for God. From sickness to unemployment and the loss of my parents and husband, these made me shed many tears to find that life was not easy, but knowing that God was with me to provide and protect me all the way to my senior years is amazing. When I moved to New York at nineteen years old and tried to make a living in a small apartment on Jefferson Avenue, I knew things had to change to make a better life for myself. Then at twenty-four years old, I met the man who would be a help to me in my attempt to become who God intended for me to become. At twenty-six years old, I married the man of my dreams, who became a great provider and cared for his children. I am a living witness that God can and will make a way for you when you trust him and know you can make it." />
