  <title>Twin Flames Kiss: A True Twin Flames Love Story - mark worrall, claire worrall</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;From a very early age, both of us felt that we were here to find someone, &amp;lsquo;the one&amp;rsquo;, and never gave up searching, regardless of numerous failed and sometimes manipulative or abusive relationships, often left believing we were the problem. This is our true love story, uniquely told from both the masculine and feminine perspectives.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Step by step, we both navigated along our spiritual journeys, learning to look inward at ourselves, and to choose love over fear, in both big and small ways, and to let go of those who brought darkness into our lives.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;It is also the story of how Claire was visited by Angels, not once but twice, and how she single-handedly worked with her Autistic son and proved the doctors who said he would never talk, wrong.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;It is the story of how we finally found each other, of how we met, and discovered an incredible soul connection, immediately merging into oneness, as if we had always been destined to eventually be together, which many describe as Twin Flames.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;We bring a message to never give up on the spiritual journey, no matter how hard it may seem at times, and to continue to search for &amp;lsquo;the one&amp;rsquo;, for everyone ultimately deserves to be blissfully happy.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;We believe we all have someone out there who is perfect for each of us, and that working on ourselves first and foremost will ultimately bring them forth.&lt;/p&gt;" />
