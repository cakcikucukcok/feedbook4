Throughout her life, author Cindy Cipriani has had to cope with losing many special loved ones. Each time, her grief was different. In &lt;i&gt;Moving Past: The Death of a Loved One&lt;/i&gt;, she offers a simple yet effective guide through the grieving process to finding peace and happiness again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Moving Past: The Death of a Loved One&lt;/i&gt; offers insight and many useful tips on self-care and healing for those who are making their way through a personal loss.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cipriani describes ten steps that each person experiences as they journey through grief. Each person takes these ten steps at his or her own pace. This helpful guidebook is organized to reflect the various emotional stages chapter by chapter and in several special passages in the book. Each passage seeks to ease you through the moment by providing a wise quote, a few thoughts to ponder, an action step, and a place to journal. Reading a page each day can assist in formulating a new life strategy by keeping our loved ones close and keeping them with us always.&lt;/p&gt;" />
