  <title>Being Human - Tammy Plunkett</title>
      <meta name="description" content="As we hurtle through our day, crashing off of one obstacle after another, we rarely find the time even to dream about a life filled with peace and spiritual awareness. And when we do pauseusually from exhaustionto wonder about those who seem to float along, feeling some sort of other connection, how many of us question the ability to do that and live in the real world? &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Tammy Plunkett puts this age-old dilemma in crystal-clear perspective when she writes: &lt;br /&gt;
Somebody has to stop meditating long enough to cook dinner. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
We dont have to move to Tibet and live in a cave to find peace. The choices we make in our everyday lives serve as the bridge between our basic reactive state and our more aware higher selves. Being Human shows how we can use these choices to transform our own lives as well as the world we live in. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Have you ever had the feeling that something is missing? That there must be more to this experience called life? Then Being Human was written for you. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Being Human will inform, entertain, and inspire you. But most of all, it will enlighten you to your humanness and give you the insight and tools to make your life fulfilled and fully satisfying, despite whatever challenges you may face. &lt;br /&gt;
