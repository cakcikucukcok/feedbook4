  <title>Passages to Freedom - Gerard Livermore</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;&lt;i&gt;Passages to Freedom: Reflections on the Inner Path&lt;/i&gt; recognizes that life presents moments that challenge, through difficult external circumstances, ones inner person. Rather than suggesting surrender to such moments, Gerard Livermore, a holistic counselor and complementary therapist, provides a diverse array of reflections that offer aid and insight along lifes path of self-discovery and transformation.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;In explaining its approach to fostering individuals inner awareness and personal power, &lt;i&gt;Passages to Freedom&lt;/i&gt;  notes, At some point in life, many of us encounter what is called the dark night of the soul; a period of often deep and intense suffering that challenges all we believe in and have lived for. This dark night provides us the opportunity (indeed often forces us) to look more deeply into ourselves, to question the nature and meaning of life and living, happiness and purpose. To encourage this self-reflection,&lt;i&gt; Passages to Freedom&lt;/i&gt; presents a series of reflections, each of which begins with a memorable observation and then moves to the on-topic insights and guidance.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;If you have made your way to the point along your lifes path where the obstacles and barriers are no longer ignorable, if you have a sense that something better awaits you, and if you desire to become more deeply aware of both your own inner being and your personal power, then &lt;i&gt;Passages to Freedom: Reflections on the Inner Path&lt;/i&gt; will help you tap into these reserves and face with confidence and serenity what life puts before you.&lt;/P&gt;" />
