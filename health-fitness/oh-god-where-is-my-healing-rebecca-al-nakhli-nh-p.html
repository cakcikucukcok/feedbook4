&lt;p&gt;This book answers the age-old questions, &quot;Why do my prayers for a healing seem to be unanswered?&quot; and, &quot;What is the missing link in my connection to God?&quot; &lt;I&gt;Oh God, &quot;Where is my Healing?&quot;&lt;/I&gt; is a self help book on how to prepare your Body, &quot;THE TEMPLE OF GOD&quot; for a Physical and Spiritual Healing and the first and last personal self help book that you will ever need. With this guide, any person can have an intimate healing from God on a physical, spiritual, and mental level. &lt;/p&gt;

Or have you ever watched a healing crusade with an arena filled with thousands of people all hoping for a healing or miracle in their lives, only to be disappointed? I know you have. In your hands is the answer millions of people are searching for, how to integrate all aspects of your life in order to realize and receive a healing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; God has given me the revelation on how to prepare our bodies to receive and retain a powerful healing amidst the chaos and confusions of hectic lifestyles. After experiencing this book, you will gain life altering enlightenment and have a smile in place for life.
Best wishes and May God bless you! &lt;/p&gt;
