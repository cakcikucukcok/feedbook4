      <meta name="description" content="The purpose of the book is to help bring a potential ray of sunshine into peoples lives with an inspirational quotation of mine every day. The 400 Inspirational Make My Day Life Quotations and Life Tips represent more than 1 for every day of the year. Some quotes are more Self Improvement related while others are thought provoking Life Tips. Together with the book we intend to provide a Cell Mobile Smartphone App, which will include the original 400 quotes together with potential updates and testimonials. There will also be a video series with 30 quotes per month together with music and images.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
The quotes in this book cover a wide range of subjects while some are very much inter related. Personal Development is a fascinating topic as it transcends many boundaries of subject learning including Psychology, Philosophy, Accelerated Learning and Brain Development studies. Ideally the Make My Day quotes and tips will provide people with an added boost to their day, week, month and perhaps even to their lives." />
