  <title>The Devil&#39;s Poison - Dean Murphy Dds</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Fluoride and fluoridation will go down as one of the greatest controversies of the 20th century. Up until the early 1940s, fluorines effect on life was always deemed poisonous. It was proven to be altering enzymes used by living organisms to carry out a multitude of essential processes. 
	Fluorine, the most reactive element on the planet, is also the strongest free radical. Scientists in the 1930s and 1940s experimented with this element to create the most deadly nerve gasses, rocket fuel, and radioactive  U235 for the bomb. As a wood preservative,  rodentcide and insecticide, fluorine compounds are second to none.
	As an Orthodontist, I began investigating the increasingly prevalent lines and spots that I saw on the enamel of children. Like rings on a tree, they indicate excessive fluorine exposure. I started to ask the question, How does fluorine cause these marks?
 Chronic doses of fluoride, like arsenic and lead, accumulate in our bodies causing a blockage in the way cells breathe and leads to the malformation of collagen. Cancer, diabetes, thyroid and neurological disorders, hormonal imbalances, heart disease, arthritis and osteoporosis have all been linked to chronic fluoride ingestion.  We are now exposed to increasing doses of fluoride from toothpaste, rinses, water, food, medicines, showering, bathing, and even the air that we breathe. Our environment has become a literal fluoride dumping ground.
	This book explores many chronic diseases that plague man today and looks at the scientists that connected these diseases to chronic exposures of fluoride." />
