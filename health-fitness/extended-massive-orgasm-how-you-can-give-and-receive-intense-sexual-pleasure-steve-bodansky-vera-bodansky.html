Women who thought they were unable to experience orgasm at all have learned to become fully orgasmic through the techniques in this book. These women experienced such pleasurable intensity and sensation in their bodies for an extended time period that the preconceptions and limitations they had placed on themselves and their sexual potential were totally vanquished.&lt;br&gt;&lt;BR&gt;And this is available to anyone who reads the book and applies and practices the methods described in &lt;I&gt;Extended Massive Orgasm&lt;/I&gt;.&lt;/DIV&gt;" />
