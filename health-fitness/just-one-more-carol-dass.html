  <title>Just One More - Carol Dass</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This book gives an insight into the life of a carer, Carol, whose loved one, Paul, was addicted to alcohol. Carol never gave up hope that Paul would receive treatment and become the person he always wanted to be. But it was not to be. Paul died at the age of forty-two from cirrhosis of the liver. In her book, Carol concentrates more on how loved ones can get the support they need while dealing with their loved ones addiction. She details her journey through Pauls addiction and why she founded the charity Footprints, which offered support to others in a situation similar to hers. She talks honestly about her feelings of frustration, anger, and sadness but also is honest about feeling trapped in a relationship, not knowing in which direction to move, the many relapses that happen, the trips to the ER, the suicide attempts, and the violence. But she also shows compassion for the drinker, who is also trapped in the addiction, not knowing what life will be like without their nonjudgmental friend, the bottle of alcohol." />
