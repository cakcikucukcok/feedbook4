  <title>Understanding Diabetes for Action - Roland Fleurizier</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Dr. Fleurizier made a detour by studying medicines, after he graduated with a Master of Social Practices of Development from Sorbonne, in Paris, France. He became among other things a Master Herbalist before he studied to be a Naturopathic Doctor and a Practitioner of Traditional Chinese Holistic Energy Medicine. His knowledge of herbs has helped others to BE WELL. 
Nowadays he practices Energy Medicine to first balance people on the energetic and emotional levels, but still believes that herbs could be suitable for some individuals mostly depending on the ailments they may have developed. 
Dr. Roland Fleurizier, N. D., has a background in Naturopathy and Applied Kinesiology.  His dedication and passion for natural and holistic energy medicine is an extension of the various experiences he has accumulated to date. 
He conducts seminars and weekly radio programs on diabetes, blood pressure, cancer, osteoporosis, multiple sclerosis, epilepsy, thyroid, etc. for the sake of bringing Haitian expatriates and other ethnicities easier access to information on general health. 
Diabetes has become the most common disease in the United States. It has been associated with the rapid spread of poor lifestyle choices. 
Dr. Fleurizier teaches a health class and believes that the way to tackle diabetes is even largely unknown to most physicians. He also believes that diabetics do not fully comprehend all the aspects of their ailments.  With this in mind, he has undertaken this research and initiated a comprehensive, restorative agenda for diabetics to use in order to subjugate their disease." />
