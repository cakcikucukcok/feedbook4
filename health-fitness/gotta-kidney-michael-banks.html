  <title>Gotta Kidney?! - Michael Banks</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;I wrote the book because not only did I want to record all the positives that occurred because of my illness, I also wanted to share my story so that others could benefit from it. This book is written for all the millions of people who are affected directly or indirectly by kidney disease and indeed who face major life-changing challenges of any kind, whether they be medical or otherwise. However I believe that people will feel encouraged and inspired by reading Gotta Kidney?! This book is not a medical journal nor does it pretend to be a work of great literature! It is the story of my journey from being diagnosed with CKD (chronic kidney disease) through kidney failure, dialysis, transplant, and into recovery. As the subtitle of the books states, it is A Journey Through Fear to Hope and Beyond. The book will benefit readers who are looking for a kind of preview of what can happen from a medical perspective. Along the way I do also present a few learnings and some bits of advice. There are even some sprinklings of lighthearted humor in the book. Hopefully the reader will find the story accessible and gain a degree of comfort from reading about someone else&amp;rsquo;s journey. Knowing that others have been down the road you&amp;rsquo;re embarking upon, or on already, can be comforting in and of itself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And finally, the book includes a chapter written by Karin, my donor. Her journey through the various barriers she faced to donating one of her kidneys demonstrates courage and generosity in the face of fear and resistance. We hope the book will encourage and inspire those considering donating a kidney, and being a living donor, to go ahead in the knowledge that the rewards of donating can be so great.&lt;/p&gt;" />
