  <title>I Look for Miracles Like Other People Look for Mail - Maxine Woody</title>
      <meta name="description" content="As I pen these words for this overview, a great storm called Sandy is under way to hit here in Connecticut. The power went off, and it seems like the worse storm I have ever been in. However, I trust in God. I know he never fails. If you are reading this book, he didnt fail this time, and he never will. This book is not just for Christians. It is like the Gospel; one size fits all. That is because God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten Son that whosoever believes in him shall not perish but shall have everlasting life. As you read this book, remember you are a gift from God, just as everyone is. So look inside you for your miracle, knowing no matter who you are, you are blessed to be a blessing. There is a song that says there is no secret what God can do, that what he has done for others he will do for you. This is my testimony as to what God has done for me. I know that he will do the same for you today. Just believe. Study Gods Word for yourself, and please allow yourself to learn from others. Also be a hearer and a doer of the word. The name of the Lord is a strong tower, the righteous runneth unto it and is safe (Proverb 18:10)." />
