  <title>Bulletproof Recovery - Paul W. Anderson, PhD</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;Relapse can attack and ruin your recovery like the bullets from a drive-by shooting. Fifty percent of all people who attempt recovery from addictive behavior relapse. How do you sustain sobriety?&lt;P&gt;Bad ideas lead to good people dying. Not because ideas kill, but because bad ideas die-hard and these ideas form the hot beds for addictions to thrive. Addictions kill People dont realize they have killer ideas floating around in their heads. However, if you attempt recovery from addiction and achieve sobriety, you will quickly run into these bad ideas. Certain bad ideas must die so sobriety can live.&lt;P&gt;Examples of Bulletproof thinking that counteract bad ideas: &lt;P&gt;	Bad Idea: Staying sober has little to do with the shape you or your life is in. Just use your program and you will be okay. &lt;P&gt;	Bulletproof Idea: The better shape you are in, the better your recovery program will work for you.&lt;P&gt;	Bad Idea: What you feel is what is real. &lt;P&gt;	Bulletproof Idea: Thoughts are as important as feelings to sustain recovery. &lt;P&gt;	Bad Idea: Pain can kill you.&lt;P&gt;	Bulletproof Idea: Pain cannot kill you. What you do about pain can.&lt;P&gt;Nothing dies harder than a bad idea! Bulletproof Recovery gives you the keys and step-by-step direction to cure stinking thinking and stay sober from any addiction. The formula is based on this fact: addiction thrives in the lives of people who take poor care of themselves. Chapter 6, The Seven Highly Successful Keys To Sustained Sobriety, starts to fill your recovery tool box. Your thinking changes with chapter 8, From Selfish to Self Care and gets you ready To Prevent Relapse, Put Yourself In Hospital and Stay There (chapter 10). In chapter 13, you learn You Cant Cure an Addiction, But You Can Outgrow One and chapter 15 gives you insight into Balance: Living In the Eye of the Hurricane. &lt;P&gt;Be good to yourself. Get Bulletproof Recovery and stop addiction forever!&lt;/P&gt;" />
