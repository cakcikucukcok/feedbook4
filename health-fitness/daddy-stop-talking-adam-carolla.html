  <title>Daddy, Stop Talking! - Adam Carolla</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The comedian, actor, television host, podcast king, and &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; bestselling author of &lt;em&gt;President Me, Not Taco Bell Material&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;In Fifty Years We&amp;#8217;ll All Be Chicks&lt;/em&gt; now lays down the law on the plight of the modern parent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Parents, do you often think that if your kids had to grow up the way you did&amp;#8212;without iPads, 70-inch flatscreen TVs, American Girl dolls, and wifi in the climate controlled minivan&amp;#8212;that they might actually be better off? Do you feel underappreciated or ignored? Do you worry you&amp;#8217;re raising a bunch of spoiled softies who will never know how to do anything themselves&amp;#8212;because you do everything for them? If you answered yes to any of these questions, you need &lt;em&gt;Daddy, Stop Talking.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Adam rips parenthood a new one, telling it straight about what adults must do if they don&amp;#8217;t want to have to support their kids forever. Using his own crappy childhood as a cautionary tale, and touting the pitfalls of the kind of helicopter parenting so pervasive today, &lt;em&gt;Daddy, Stop Talking&lt;/em&gt; is the only parenting book you should ever read. Here, too, is sage advice to Adam&amp;#8217;s own kids&amp;#8212;and to future parents&amp;#8212;on what matters most: dating; drinking and drugs; buying your first house and car; puberty; and what kind of assholes his kids (and yours) should avoid becoming. Even if his own son and daughter pretty much ignore everything he says, you shouldn&amp;#8217;t. And you&amp;#8217;re welcome. Again.&lt;/p&gt;" />
