  <title>Christians Under Siege - Patrick J. Roelle Sr.</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;Christians Under Siege, is a comprehensive study of the war on Christian values that started in the Arabian Desert, and which now reaches into Americas schools and workplace. Barrack Hussein Obama declared that the United States is not a Christian Nation. Historian Patrick Roelle disagrees. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;To deal with Islams terrorist we must understand Islams Terrorist. Islam rose out of the Arabia Desert because the strong oppressed the weak. The world of Islam is not just a religion, its a form of government. We are at a crossroads. Some wish to cancel God from the equation, enslave us to a future of debt we cannot repay, place our energy dependence on the Muslim world while we lock our resources in the ground, and transfer our wealth in exchange for government subsidies that will keep us subdued, and we are falling for it.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Joseph Goebbels, propaganda expert and Reich Minister of Public Enlightenment and Education, for Nazi Germany once said: If you tell a lie big enough and keep repeating it, people will eventually come to believe it. The American Muslim community has successfully employed these methods these past fifty years to indoctrinate our elected officials and the mainstream press in this country. Christians Under Siege paints the true picture. &lt;/P&gt;" />
