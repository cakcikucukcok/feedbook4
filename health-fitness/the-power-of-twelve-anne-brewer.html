  <title>The Power of Twelve - Anne Brewer</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Anne Brewer, a corporate marketing consultant, was stunned when she began receiving telepathic messages from a group of friendly non-physical beings sent to help raise the consciousness of Earth. According to these beings, in eons past, humans were created with only two active strands of DNA which limited our evolutionary potential and inhibited the ability to ascend or function as Spirit in physical form. They taught her a process called 12-Strand DNA Recoding that she has shared with thousands in her book, &lt;i&gt;The Power of Twelve, A New Approach to Empowerment Through 12-Strand DNA Consciousness&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;p&gt;
Annes remarkable true story of her DNA Recoding is of great assistance to all of us who desire to achieve our full potential. Her transformative process includes powerful channeled instruction and holistic balancing modalities to quicken manifestations and clear the path to love. The power of the 12-strand DNA energy is illustrated through Annes examples of how she obtained greater heath, wealth, and happiness in her own life. This power will increase your energy vibration which enables you to operate at a greater potential, increase your psychic abilities, release debilitating emotions of fear and guilt, quicken your skills for manifesting, and enable you ultimately to ascend from the Earth realm to the next phase of your soul growth." />
