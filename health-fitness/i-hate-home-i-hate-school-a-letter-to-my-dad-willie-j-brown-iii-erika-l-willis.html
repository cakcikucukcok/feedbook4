  <title>I Hate Home, I Hate School! a Letter to My Dad - Willie J. Brown Iii, Erika L. Willis</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Rockhead the Great: I Hate Home, I Hate School is a powerful testimonial that many kids in America can relate to. It tells the story of a young boys early struggle with home and the academic rigors of school. The death of his father, an alcoholic mother, and several learning challenges could not keep Rockhead the Great from dreaming big. Growing up in a rural, South Georgia community, It took a village to help our main character succeed. Determined to be successful, Rockhead chose to use a love of church, school, and the game of baseball as his way out of his bad situation. After losing his dad and refocusing his energies, school became a place of refuge for our main character. Teachers became his guides, leading him to greener pastures." />
