  <title>Carrier to Classroom: Transferring Military Skills Into a Career In Education - Charles W. Baldwin</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Carrier to Classroom is a call to action for men and women currently serving or who have served in the U.S. Armed Forces to consider education as a second career choice. Their familiarity with structure and discipline provides them with a unique advantage in the all important skill of classroom management. VETERANS, we need you in education. It is the most incredibly rewarding experience. As a Command Master Chief hear me loud and clear, young people today are seeking mentors, discipline, and want to learn. The junk you read about public schools being disruptive with poor learning environments are about schools with poor leadership and a lack of understanding of the value of properly administered discipline. The majority of the schools are loaded with wonderful young women and men. Please continue serving your country by serving and providing the leadership and education our children deserve. Enjoy Carrier to Classroom." />
