Women need this kind of honest excavation of the process of living.&quot; --Meryl Streep&lt;br&gt; &lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt; An astonishingly frank, funny, poignant book for any woman who wishes they had someone who would say to them, &quot;This happened to me, learn from my mistakes &lt;i&gt;and&lt;/i&gt; my successes. Because you don&#39;t get smarter as you get older, you get braver.&quot;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Sheila Nevins is the best friend you never knew you had. She is your discreet confidante you can tell any secret to, your sage mentor at work who helps you navigate the often uneven playing field, your wise sister who has &quot;been there, done that,&quot; your hysterical girlfriend whose stories about men will make laugh until you cry. Sheila Nevins is the one person who always tells it like it is. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In &lt;i&gt;You Don&#39;t Look Your Age&lt;/i&gt;, the famed documentary producer (as President of HBO Documentary Films for over 30 years, Nevins has rightfully been credited with creating the documentary rebirth) finally steps out from behind the camera and takes her place front and center.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In these pages you will read about the real life challenges of being a woman in a man&#39;s world, what it means to be a working mother, what it&#39;s like to be an older woman in a youth-obsessed culture, the sometimes changing, often sweet truth about marriages, what being a feminist really means, and that you are in good company if your adult children don&#39;t return your phone calls.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; So come, sit down, make yourself comfortable, (and for some of you, don&#39;t forget the damn reading glasses). You&#39;re in for a treat.&lt;/p&gt;" />
