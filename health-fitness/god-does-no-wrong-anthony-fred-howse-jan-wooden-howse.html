  <title>God Does No Wrong - Anthony Fred Howse, Jan Wooden Howse</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Thank you Bill for your friendship and your Wonderful endorsement it means so much to Anthony and I. And Titus, what can dad and I say. You have a flair for taking powerful pictures. Thank you for taking the one above of us on the swing for this book we will remember it always son.
Over a decade ago, the author of this book sent me a short story with a number of photos to place on my Eddy Arnold website, which I have maintained since 1997.
Happily, I posted it immediately as I was confident the visitors to the site would enjoy reading it as much as I did. The narrative was a beautiful true story of a young boy who loved his family, his God, his Church, and Eddy Arnold. It was a big hit on the site. It remains on the Index page of the site.
And now this narrative has grown into a book with over three hundred pages. Many of these chapters were written over a period of years. I found this book to be a Mom &amp; Apple Pie, type... full of love and happiness and American families.
When reading this wonderful book you will experience romance, marriage, birth, death, happiness, sadness, health, sickness and always the love and power of the Almighty!
The author is so skilled in her writing that I could visually see the events described printed page.
Although you will shed, a tear or two while engaged with the real people in their sadness it will fade as the overall theme of the book will make you happy.
This book is a MUST READ for Eddy Arnold fans and all who enjoy reading just a plain GOOD BOOK!
