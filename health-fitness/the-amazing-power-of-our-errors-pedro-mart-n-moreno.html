  <title>The Amazing Power of Our Errors - Pedro Martín-Moreno</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Id like to know who in the world hasnt made more than one mistake a day. The answer is obvious, but thats not really the problem. Its that we dont know what we should do with the negative energyby the way very toxicthat inevitably stays inside us when we dont properly handle our emotions and decisions about our mistakes. This powerful manual doesnt assume that were saints, or much less, that were perfect. What it seeks to show us is how we can free ourselves from the damage and distress associated with the errors that we commit, always with the aim of being able to feel better, grow, gain new skills, develop ourselves more fully, and stay in a process of continual improvement with no need to live as victims of these errors. As you read this manual, you will discover, among many other things, the damage done to human beings by the formidable React Without Thinking (RWT) virus and youll also find out what to do to control it. Likewise, you will understand what guilt really is and how to transform the negative energy that inevitably accompanies it into positive energy. Errors are, perhaps, our best allies, but regrettably, there are very few people who are fortunate enough to see them this way.&lt;/p&gt;" />
