  <title>A Better Side of Me - Miss T.L.C</title>
      <meta name="description" content="I believe we all have had these thoughts once or twice in our life. Some of us may feel we are cursed and were just left on this earth as someones cruel joke to manipulate and hurt. Im sure that some of us may even be hurting due to circumstances from someone we love and trusted to care for us. Whatever your thoughts and questions are, there is an answer for it. We may not always understand at the time but everything happens for a reason. Timing is everything and remember above all, some are sicker than others. We are not all with healthy thoughts or feelings, some people carry some pretty heavy stuff around with them as they try to get through their daily life. Some of us carry our parents issues as well as our own. This allows us to be bullied and picked on. Some of us are desperate; some of us are just confused on what we should do. No matter what we say out loud or the actions we take the mistakes we make or carry for another, will ever be hidden. We show all our feelings in our actions as well as expressions. We should never allow our self to feel like we dont belong we dont fit in or we are not loved. This is our brain giving us false information because of a feeling or thought and sights we are producing. This my friends is an unhealthy STATE OF MIND. Having this will lead us to destruction lead us to believing anything about us. We are no good we dont deserve love we are no good to anyone. I hate me I hate my life no one cares no one will miss me. What difference will it make if Im here or not?" />
