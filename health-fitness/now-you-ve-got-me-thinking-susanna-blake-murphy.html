  <title>Now You’Ve Got Me Thinking - Susanna Blake Murphy</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;As youve probably noticed by now, life gets harder as you get older, and your feelings about things get bigger and bigger. Sometimes you feel happy, sometimes you feel frustrated, sometimes you feel bored, and sometimes you feel alone. One of the best and most fun ways to deal with all these different feelings is to write them down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Now Youve Got Me Thinking&lt;/i&gt; is the perfect place to record your thoughts and feelings. If you have kept a diary before and thought it was fun for a day or two but then gradually lost interest or couldnt think of things to write, this journal is for you. Each day, it asks you a few questions to spark some thoughts. Some of the questions are funny or weird, and others are more serious. Some days you will be in the mood for the fun parts, and other days you might just need a place to write down your feelings to help you begin to sort through some tricky problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Either way, &lt;i&gt;Now Youve Got Me Thinking&lt;/i&gt; offers the best place to start your life as a diary keeper. Have fun and answer quirky questions about yourself.&lt;/p&gt;" />
