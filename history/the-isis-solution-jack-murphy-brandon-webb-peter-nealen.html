  <title>The ISIS Solution - Jack Murphy, Brandon Webb, Peter Nealen</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The President recently announced that we don&#39;t have a strategy for dealing with ISIS.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;It&#39;s too soon to say what steps the United States will take against ISIS. I don&#39;t want to put the cart before the horse,&quot; Obama told reporters during a White House news briefing. &quot;We don&#39;t have a strategy yet.&quot;&quot;-President Obama&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If we have been at war with terror for over a decade and still don&#39;t have solid strategies for dealing with radical terrorism, then what have we really been doing the last thirteen years?  It&#39;s a good question to ask yourself, and at least the President was telling the truth when he said we don&#39;t have a strategy for ISIS.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As ISIS grows in strength with each successful battle, they will also set up the infrastructure of something resembling a functional state.  They will become a self-funded organization making millions of dollars from oil revenue.  Left unchecked, it is hard to say how powerful they could become.  The dream of a pan-Islamic caliphate is most certainly beyond their reach, however, they could carve out a very large swath of the Middle East for their empire. If ISIS were to capture the first and second most holy sites of the Islamic faith, Mecca and Medina, the entire Middle East may very well implode.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;The ISIS Solution&lt;/i&gt; takes a look at the current geopolitical situation, organizational structure of ISIS, and provides new thinking and strategies for dealing with the Islamic State in the Middle East. Its authors and contributors have over fifty years of combined experience in the intelligence, analyst and Special Operations communities. Leadership and a new philosophical conversation of action is needed to eliminate violent terrorism. This book starts the conversation.&lt;/p&gt;" />
