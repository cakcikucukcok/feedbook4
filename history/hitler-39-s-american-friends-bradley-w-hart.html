  <title>Hitler&#39;s American Friends - Bradley W. Hart</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;A book examining the strange terrain of Nazi sympathizers, nonintervention campaigners and other voices in America who advocated on behalf of Nazi Germany in the years before World War II.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Americans who remember World War II reminisce about how it brought the country together. The less popular truth behind this warm nostalgia: until the attack on Pearl Harbor, America was deeply, dangerously divided.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bradley W. Hart&#39;s &lt;i&gt;Hitler&#39;s American Friends &lt;/i&gt;exposes the homegrown antagonists who sought to protect and promote Hitler, leave Europeans (and especially European Jews) to fend for themselves, and elevate the Nazi regime. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some of these friends were Americans of German heritage who joined the Bund, whose leadership dreamed of installing a stateside Führer. Some were as bizarre and hair-raising as the Silver Shirt Legion, run by an eccentric who claimed that Hitler fulfilled a religious prophesy. Some were Midwestern Catholics like Father Charles Coughlin, an early right-wing radio star who broadcast anti-Semitic tirades. They were even members of Congress who used their franking privilege--sending mail at cost to American taxpayers--to distribute German propaganda. And celebrity pilot Charles Lindbergh ended up speaking for them all at the America First Committee.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We try to tell ourselves it couldn&#39;t happen here, but Americans are not immune to the lure of fascism. &lt;i&gt;Hitler&#39;s American Friends&lt;/i&gt; is a powerful look at how the forces of evil manipulate ordinary people, how we stepped back from the ledge, and the disturbing ease with which we could return to it.&lt;/p&gt;" />
