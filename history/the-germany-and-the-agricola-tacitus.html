I believe that Tacitus was a very good writer and a good thinker and a fine cognitive philosopher in an age before the science of cognitive psychology existed. It was the translation of The Annals that I did not fully embrace. Tacitus does leave out a lot of details.<br /><b><i>Amazon.com: The Germany and the Agricola of Tacitus eBook ...</i></b> | Tacitus provides an interesting ethnography of both Britons and Germans, none of which is complementary to the Romans. Furthermore, in AGRICOLA, an oration on his father-in-law's life, Tacitus holds ups a mirror of virtue by which one can see the corruption and degeneracy of the current Roman emperor in particular and Roman elites in general.<br /><p><h3 align="left">Download Ebook|PDF|Epub of <a href=>The Germany and the Agricola - Tacitus</a> </h3></p><hr/>
