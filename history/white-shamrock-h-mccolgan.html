      <meta name="description" content="In 1860 sixty percent of Europes cotton came from the Southern States. It was now being stopped by union blockades. The need to acquire the cotton became the economic savior for many Europe countries and they were willing to do anything to get it. 
Starting in 1830 the story will take the reader from a little town in Ireland across the Channel to London and back. As the battle between the Orange Order and the Catholic working man in Northern Ireland reaches the tipping point. Stopping it could hinge on the decision of one man. A judge who enlists the aid of two families and a Georgia Plantation owner to create a business that will help both sides. The importing and manufacturing of cotton goods. But first one man must be sentence to hang. 
Follow the lives of the families as their business grows. Love, treachery, murder and historical figures impact them as plots twist and turn. The race to try an influence England and France as to who to back in American Civil War and save their company is on. An cotton is the Key. 
The impact and the twist on lives is how history becomes legends." />
