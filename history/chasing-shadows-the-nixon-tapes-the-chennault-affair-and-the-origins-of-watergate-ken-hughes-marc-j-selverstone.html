  <title>Chasing Shadows: The Nixon Tapes, the Chennault Affair, and the Origins of Watergate - Ken Hughes, Marc J. Selverstone</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The break-in at Watergate and the cover-up that followed brought about     the resignation of Richard Nixon, creating a political shockwave that reverberates to this day.     But as Ken Hughes reveals in his powerful new book, in all the thousands of hours of     declassified White House tapes, the president orders a single break-in--and it is not at the     Watergate complex. Hughes&#39;s examination of this earlier break-in, plans for which the     White House ultimately scrapped, provides a shocking new perspective on a long history of     illegal activity that prolonged the Vietnam War and was only partly exposed by the Watergate     scandal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a key player in the University of Virginia&#39;s Miller Center     Presidential Recordings Program, Hughes has spent more than a decade developing and mining the     largest extant collection of transcribed tapes from the Johnson and Nixon White Houses.     Hughes&#39;s unparalleled investigation has allowed him to unearth a pattern of actions by     Nixon going back long before 1972, to the final months of the Johnson administration. Hughes     identified a clear narrative line that begins during the 1968 campaign, when Nixon, concerned     about the impact on his presidential bid of the Paris peace talks with the Vietnamese, secretly     undermined the negotiations through a Republican fundraiser named Anna Chennault. Three years     after the election, in an atmosphere of paranoia brought on by the explosive appearance of the     Pentagon Papers, Nixon feared that his treasonous--and politically damaging--manipulation of the     Vietnam talks would be exposed. Hughes shows how this fear led to the creation of the Secret     Investigations Unit, the &quot;White House Plumbers,&quot; and Nixon&#39;s initiation of     illegal covert operations guided by the Oval Office. Hughes&#39;s unrivaled command of the     White House tapes has allowed him to build an argument about Nixon that goes far beyond what we     think we know about Watergate.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;i&gt;Chasing Shadows&lt;/i&gt; is also     available as a special e-book that links to the massive collection of White House tapes     published by the Miller Center through Rotunda, the electronic imprint of the University of     Virginia Press. This unique edition allows the reader to move seamlessly from the book to the     recordings&#39; expertly rendered transcripts and to listen to audio files of the     remarkable--and occasionally shocking--conversations on which this dark chapter in American     history would ultimately turn.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />
