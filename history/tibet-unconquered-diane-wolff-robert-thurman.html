  <title>Tibet Unconquered - Diane Wolff, Robert Thurman</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;A fabled country in the far reaches of the Himalayas, Tibet looms large in the popular imagination. The original home of the Dalai Lama, one of the great spiritual leaders of our time, Tibetan Buddhism inspires millions worldwide with the twin values of wisdom and compassion. Yet the Chinese takeover six decades ago also shows another side of Tibet--that of a passionate symbol of freedom in the face of political oppression. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;International sympathy has kept the Dalai Lama&#39;s appeals for autonomy on the world&#39;s political agenda, but in light of China&#39;s political and economic gains there is fear that Tibet is in danger of being forgotten by the world. As the Dalai Lama grows older, and the Chinese threaten to intervene in the selection of Tibet&#39;s next spiritual leader, many wonder if there is any hope for the Tibetan way of life, or if it is doomed to become a casualty of globalization.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In &lt;i&gt;Tibet Unconquered&lt;/i&gt; East Asia expert Diane Wolff explores the status of Tibet over eight-hundred-years of history. From the Mongol invasion, to the emergence of the Dalai Lama, Wolff investigates the history of political and economic relations between China and Tibet. Looking to the long rule of Chinggis Khan as a model, she argues, that by thinking in regional terms both countries could usher in a new era of prosperity while maintaining their historical and cultural identities. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wolff creates a forward-thinking blueprint for resolving the China and Tibet problem, grounded in the history of the region and the reality of today&#39;s political environment that, will guide both countries to peace.&lt;/p&gt;" />
