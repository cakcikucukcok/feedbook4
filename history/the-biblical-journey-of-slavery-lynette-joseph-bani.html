  <title>The Biblical Journey of Slavery - Lynette Joseph-Bani</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Th e narrative presented provides a source of enlightenment for descendants of the African Diaspora. The past enslavement of Captive Africans was not an accident, but fulfillment of Biblical prophecy. The Prophet Moses warned in scripture, that, the Hebrews will be enslaved in the latter days, by a nation of fierce countenance, and taken away naked in ships. A yoke of iron will be on their necks, no regard for the old or favour for the young (Deut. 28:48-50; 64-68). Th e 400 years of Hebrew slavery in Egypt, is paralled with 400 years the Atlantic Slave Trade endured for African people.
&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;
The Ancestral history of the African Diaspora provides knowledge of a legacy of greatness as well as an inheritance of sad consequences brought about through a curse for disobedience. Th e text will show that the Anglo American world power fits the description of the last world power that will enslave the people who were delivered, from Egyptian bondage.
&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;
Illustrations and maps provide information on ancient lands and the people of scripture. It challenges the accepted view of the masses on characters of scripture, and will show from the Bible and secular historical accounts where descendants of a family that started out in Mesopotamia can be found today. Black People need to recognize their roots in order to grow, and become fi t for the services they were created to perform.
&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;
The journey will aquaint readers with the contributions Africans made to the world,and the inherited legacy theyve been denied." />
