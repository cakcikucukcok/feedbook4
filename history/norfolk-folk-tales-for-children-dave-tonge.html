  <title>Norfolk Folk Tales for Children - Dave Tonge</title>
      <meta name="description" content="From dark dangerous dogs and wily wicked wyrms, to poor penniless pedlars and lanky, long-limbed lads, Norfolk is steeped in stories. Some had their beginnings here, growing in the telling until they were as big as Norfolk’s skies. Others were brought here by travellers from far away and even Viking raiders long ago — stories that in time would change to suit our Norfolk ways, for as everyone knows we do different!
This is a collection of tales reworked for children to get to know this county — its places, people and their strange and wondrous dialect — while also celebrating its shared culture with the wider world. In this collection, we journey to a place where fact and fiction, truth and lie, become as one." />
