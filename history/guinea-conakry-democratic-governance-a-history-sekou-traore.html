      <meta name="description" content="Guinea Conakry Democratic Governance, A History. Guinea Political Book. With an area of almost 246,000 square kilometers Guinea forms a rough crescent from its western border on the Atlantic Ocean curving towards the east and south. It shares its northern border with Guinea-Bissau, Senegal and Mali, and a southern border with Sierra Leone, Liberia and Cote d&#39;Ivoire. Until France colonized it in the 1890s, the land that is now Guinea belonged to a series of African empires. After gaining independence from France on 2 October 1958, Guinea experienced autocratic rule, until October 2008, when a military junta seized control. In January 2010, the junta appointed a Prime Minister to head a six- month transitional government leading up to elections. The first round of the presidential election held in June 2010 was billed as the first free and fair election since independence in 1958." />
