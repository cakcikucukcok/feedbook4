  <title>Albion Lodge196er - W.Bro. Ngd Atwell Pdsgw</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This book traces the history of Freemasonry in Barbados from its earliest times in 1740 through to the Consecration of Albion Lodge No. 196 E.R., in 1790 thereafter the reader will embark upon an exciting journey to the present day. 
Although this book has particular emphasis on the history of Albion Lodge No. 196 E.R., this Lodge did not exist in isolation. Therefore there are several pages dedicated to other Lodges meeting in Barbados and registered under the United Grand Lodge of England, Lodges registered under the Scottish Constitution, especially Lodge Scotia 340 S.C. and Lodges registered under Irish Constitutions which have long ceased to exist. There is also materials on the formation of the District Grand Lodge of Barbados and the Eastern Caribbean as it is now called, and a list of District Grand Masters, which should be of interest to members of Lodges that comprise the District. 
This is a must reader for every member of Albion Lodge 196 E.R., and masons of other Lodges meeting in Barbados and the Eastern Caribbean, who have a keen interest in understanding the several trials which Freemasonry had to overcome in order to become the vibrant organization it is today." />
