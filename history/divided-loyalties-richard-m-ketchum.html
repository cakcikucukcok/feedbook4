  <title>Divided Loyalties - Richard M. Ketchum</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Before the Civil War splintered the young country, there was another conflict that divided friends and family--the Revolutionary War&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prior to the French and Indian War, the British government had taken little interest in their expanding American empire. Years of neglect had allowed America&#39;s fledgling democracy to gain power, but by 1760 America had become the biggest and fastest-growing part of the British economy, and the mother country required tribute. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the Revolution came to New York City, it tore apart a community that was already riven by deep-seated family, political, religious, and economic antagonisms. Focusing on a number of individuals, &lt;i&gt;Divided Loyalties&lt;/i&gt; describes their response to increasingly drastic actions taken in London by a succession of the king&#39;s ministers, which finally forced people to take sides and decide whether they would continue their loyalty to Great Britain and the king, or cast their lot with the American insurgents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using fascinating detail to draw us into history&#39;s narrative, Richard M. Ketchum explains why New Yorkers with similar life experiences--even members of the same family--chose different sides when the war erupted.&lt;/p&gt;" />
