  <title>Slavery by Any Other Name - Eric Allina</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Based on documents from a long-lost and unexplored colonial archive,
    &lt;i&gt;Slavery by Any Other Name&lt;/i&gt; tells the story of how Portugal privatized part of
    its empire to the Mozambique Company. In the late nineteenth and twentieth centuries, the
    company governed central Mozambique under a royal charter and built a vast forced labor regime
    camouflaged by the rhetoric of the civilizing mission.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Oral testimonies from
    more than one hundred Mozambican elders provide a vital counterpoint to the perspectives of
    colonial officials detailed in the archival records of the Mozambique Company. Putting elders&#39;
    voices into dialogue with officials&#39; reports, Eric Allina reconstructs this modern form of
    slavery, explains the impact this coercive labor system had on Africans’ lives, and
    describes strategies they used to mitigate or deflect its burdens. In analyzing Africans’
    responses to colonial oppression, Allina documents how some Africans succeeded in recovering
    degrees of sovereignty, not through resistance, but by placing increasing burdens on fellow
    Africans—a dynamic that paralleled developments throughout much of the
    continent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This volume also traces the international debate on slavery, labor,
    and colonialism that ebbed and flowed during the first several decades of the twentieth century,
    exploring a conversation that extended from the backwoods of the Mozambique-Zimbabwe borderlands
    to ministerial offices in Lisbon and London. &lt;i&gt;Slavery by Any Other Name&lt;/i&gt;
    situates this history of forced labor in colonial Africa within the broader and deeper history
    of empire, slavery, and abolition, showing how colonial rule in Africa simultaneously continued
    and transformed past forms of bondage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />
