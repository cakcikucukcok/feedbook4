  <title>Fighting Saddam in Iraq and Isis in Syria - Steven Gonzalez</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Steven Gonzalez was a sergeant first class in the Army Reserve in March 2003 when his company received orders to invade Iraq.
For the next twelve months, Gonzalez and his unit would mostly convoy escorts, set up checkpoints, and provide security around the perimeter of Tallil Air Base near Nasiriyah, Iraq.
He returned to Texas in March 2004, resuming his job with the Haltom City Police Department, and in 2004, he retired after twenty-one years in the military. But he was not yet done with the terrorists.
In 2007, he returned to Iraq to help train the Iraqi police as an employee with DynCorp International, and in 2013, he signed up to fight ISIS as an employee with Universal Protection Service.
But he did not agree with President Barack Obamas pronouncement that ISIS was a JV team nor with his decision not to send troops to Syria. Fortunately, he found a way to join some of his fellow former soldiers fighting ISIS on its own turf.
Join Gonzalez as he honors some of the great friends hes lost and shares the challenges hes faced in Fighting Saddam in Iraq and ISIS in Syria." />
