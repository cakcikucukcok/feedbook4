  <title>The Real Cause of the Civil War - Jack L. Pennington</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The Civil War that so devastated the United States began a century and a half ago; even so, people continue to disagree on why the North and South went to war. 
By examining President Abraham Lincolns speeches, along with those of other politicians during the time period, it is possible to identify historical misrepresentations and distortions that have made their way into textbooks.
Author Jack Pennington, a historian and retired school teacher, seeks to answer three main questions:
Were the lives of the blacks in the South better off following the war and Reconstruction? 
Are blacks still suffering from the remnants of Jim Crow laws?
Would the natural time eradication of slavery, as predicted by Lincoln, Jefferson Davis, and other leading figures, have been more effective in bringing about equality and racial tolerance?
Discover the true nature of Lincolns actions and his primary motivations, and explore the politics and attitudes that led the North and South to split. Pennington seeks to explore the truth behind common misconceptions and illuminate The Real Cause of the Civil War." />
