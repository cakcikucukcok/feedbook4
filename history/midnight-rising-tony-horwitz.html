But few Americans know the true story of the men and women who launched a desperate strike at the slaveholding South. Now, &lt;i&gt;Midnight Rising &lt;/i&gt;portrays Brown&#39;s uprising in vivid color, revealing a country on the brink of explosive conflict.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brown, the descendant of New England Puritans, saw slavery as a sin against America&#39;s founding principles. Unlike most abolitionists, he was willing to take up arms, and in 1859 he prepared for battle at a hideout in Maryland, joined by his teenage daughter, three of his sons, and a guerrilla band that included former slaves and a dashing spy. On October 17, the raiders seized Harpers Ferry, stunning the nation and prompting a counterattack led by Robert E. Lee. After Brown&#39;s capture, his defiant eloquence galvanized the North and appalled the South, which considered Brown a terrorist. The raid also helped elect Abraham Lincoln, who later began to fulfill Brown&#39;s dream with the Emancipation Proclamation, a measure he called &quot;a John Brown raid, on a gigantic scale.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tony Horwitz&#39;s riveting book travels antebellum America to deliver both a taut historical drama and a telling portrait of a nation divided--a time that still resonates in ours.&lt;/p&gt;" />
