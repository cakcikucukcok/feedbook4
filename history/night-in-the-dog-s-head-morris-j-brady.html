  <title>Night in the Dog’S Head - Morris J. Brady</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Night in the Dogs Head is a historically-based novel of courage and sacrifice. American soldiers are committed to a war half-way around the world to preserve a nation from a takeover by a socialist tyrant. The policy that sent Americans to Asian battlefields was subsequently repudiated. For the next three years US Forces fought and died in a war their country no longer wanted to win. While American forces consistently won their battles and inflicted appalling casualties on their foe, a poorly informed and sensation-seeking media mislead the American public, conflicted politicians turned against the war, and the US submitted to a third-rate Asian nation. 
The novel is set in the political and military affairs of the time. It realistically presents the courage and dedication, the successes and the failures of the men who fought - not for principal, but to survive a war their nation didnt want to win. Friend and foe alike are followed to reveal who they were, how and why they fought. It is a story of the Vietnam War the way it was. At the center is a single undermanned American battalion destined to face a numerically-superior enemy whose orders are to, kill the Americans. After more than 58,000 Americans were killed in action, US forces were withdrawn without a single concession from the enemy. The units cited are real; the incidents and characters have been contrived to suit the story." />
