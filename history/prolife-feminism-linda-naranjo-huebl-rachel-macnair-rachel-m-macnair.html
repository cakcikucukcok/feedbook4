  <title>Prolife Feminism - Linda Naranjo-Huebl, Rachel MacNair, Rachel M. MacNair</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&quot;We need a new way of seeing!&quot;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;--Jennifer Ferguson, South African musician &amp; Former MP, African National Congress&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Is abortion on &quot;demand&quot; a woman&#39;s right, or a wrong inflicted on women? Is it a mark of liberation, or a sign that women are not yet free? From Anglo-Irish writer Mary Wollstonecraft to Kenyan environmentalist and 2004 Nobel Peace Prize laureate Wangari Maathai, many eighteenth- through twenty-first-century feminists have opposed it as violence against fetal lives arising from violence against female lives. This more inclusive, surprisingly old-but-new vision of reproductive choice is called prolife feminism. 
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
 	This book&#39;s original edition in 1995 offered brilliant essays on abortion and related social justice issues by the likes of suffragists Susan B. Anthony and Elizabeth Cady Stanton and civil rights leader Fannie Lou Hamer. A decade of activism and research since has made this second, greatly expanded second edition necessary. It not only documents the continuing evolution of prolife feminism worldwide, but more accurately represents the rich diversity of past and present women--and men--who have stood up for both mother and child. It thus is a vital, unique resource for peacemaking in the increasingly globalized abortion war." />
