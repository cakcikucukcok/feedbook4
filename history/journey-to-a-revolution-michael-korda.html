  <title>Journey to a Revolution - Michael Korda</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The Hungarian Revolution of 1956 was perhaps the most dramatic single event of the Cold War and a major turning point in history. Though it ended unsuccessfully, the spontaneous uprising of Hungarians against their country&#39;s Communist party and the Soviet occupation forces in the wake of Stalin&#39;s death demonstrated to the world at large the failure of Communism. In full view of the Western media&amp;#8212;and therefore the world&amp;#8212;the Russians were obliged to use force on a vast scale to subdue armed students, factory workers, and intellectuals in the streets of a major European capital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In October 1956, Michael Korda and three fellow Oxford undergraduates traveled to Budapest in a beat-up Volkswagen to bring badly needed medicine to the hospitals&amp;#8212;and to participate, at street level, in one of the great battles of the postwar era. &lt;em&gt;Journey to a Revolution&lt;/em&gt; is at once history and a compelling memoir&amp;#8212;the author&#39;s riveting account of the course of the revolution, from its heroic beginnings to the sad martyrdom of its end.&lt;/p&gt;" />
