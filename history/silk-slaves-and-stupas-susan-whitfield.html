  <title>Silk, Slaves, and Stupas - Susan Whitfield</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Following her bestselling &lt;I&gt;Life Along the Silk Road&lt;/I&gt;, Susan Whitfield widens her exploration of the great cultural highway with another captivating portrait through the experience of things. &lt;I&gt;Silk, Slaves, and Stupas&lt;/I&gt; tells the stories of ten very different objects, considering their interaction with the peoples and cultures of the Silk Road&amp;mdash;those who made them, carried them, received them, used them, sold them, worshipped them, and, in more recent times, bought them, conserved them, and curated them. From a delicate pair of earrings from a steppe tomb to a massive stupa deep in Central Asia, a hoard of Kushan coins stored in an Ethiopian monastery to a Hellenistic glass bowl from a southern Chinese tomb, and a fragment of Byzantine silk wrapping the bones of a French saint to a Bactrian ewer depicting episodes from the Trojan War, these objects show us something of the cultural diversity and interaction along these trading routes of Afro-Eurasia.&lt;BR /&gt; &amp;#160;&lt;BR /&gt; Exploring the labor, tools, materials, and rituals behind these various objects, Whitfield infuses her narrative with delightful details as the objects journey through time, space, and meaning. &lt;I&gt;Silk, Slaves, and Stupas&lt;/I&gt; is a lively and unique approach to understanding the Silk Road and the cultural, economic, and technical changes of the early modern period.&lt;BR /&gt; &amp;#160;" />
