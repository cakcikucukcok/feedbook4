We know they were not; at least not at the time.&lt;P&gt;When Custer&#39;s 7th cavalry regiment was wiped out at the battle of the Little Big Horn, it was reported that the were no survivors. There were over 5000 survivors - all Native Americans. Their story reveals the truth of that battle. According to their testimony Custer was probably the first to die, forever debunking the picture of him on a hilltop fighting to the last.&lt;P&gt;Was Lincoln concerned with preserving the union or ending slavery?&lt;P&gt;What were Nixon&#39;s crimes?&lt;P&gt;How did so many Nazis escape justice?&lt;P&gt;How did The Declaration of Independence written by Thomas Jefferson finally get edited to its present form?&lt;P&gt;What is the truth behind the Roswell stories?
