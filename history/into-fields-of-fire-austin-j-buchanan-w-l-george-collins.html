  <title>Into Fields of Fire - Austin J. Buchanan, W. L. George Collins</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This story is taken from notes Austin Buck Buchanan wrote in notebooks he carried in his pocket all during World War II. Buck is no longer with us.  &lt;b&gt;W. L. George Collins&lt;/b&gt; edited and compiled Bucks notes into a manuscript that became this book.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Here you will ride with Buck as he flies his plane through a field of fire so intense that one shell blows a hole in the plane big enough for a man to go through and uncountable bullet holes perforated the plane. All aircraft controls are shot out except elevator and ailerons.  You will ride with him as he manages to complete his mission and bring his barely flying plane back to England.  And you will ride with him through hundreds more such harrowing trips, in his C-47 with no armor plate and no guns, into other fields of fire and often impossible weather. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;W. L. George Collins&lt;/b&gt; was a pilot in the same Troop Carrier Group as Buck. His writings have been published in the United States, Europe and the Middle East. He was awarded the George Washington Honor Medal by Freedoms Foundation at Valley Forge, among other writing awards." />
