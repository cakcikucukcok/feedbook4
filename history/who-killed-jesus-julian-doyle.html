This is a real life detective story stimulated by extraordinary happenings on the film set of &#39;Monty Python&#39;s Life of Brian&#39; as witnessed by Julian Doyle, the film&#39;s editor. The crime is the murder of Jesus Christ, and the book unravels the evidence to discover and disclose who was the real guilty party. The four Gospel stories of the death have massive contradictions between them, which are ignored or glossed over. But these contradictions are not mistakes they are, in fact, all true. Not only that but to make sense of them the whole Gospel story un- ravels, right down to the actual crucifixion which from the experience on the film &#39;Life of Brian&#39; is shown to be IMPOSSIBLE!
