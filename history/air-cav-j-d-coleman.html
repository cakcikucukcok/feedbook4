  <title>Air Cav - J.D. Coleman</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Air Cav: History of the 1st Cavalry Division in Vietnam 1965-1969  is the story of the small, close world of fighting men in action, told in their own words and supplemented with vivid photographs of the First Cavalry Division’s experience in the war and a history of the division.
This volume can be many things to many people—a book of memories, a souvenir, a pictorial essay on airmobility, or simply a story of gallant men at war. It can be many things, but one thing it is not, nor does it pretend to be—a complete history of the 1st Air Cavalry Division in Vietnam.
The task and burden of history must lie with the objectivity of future generations, far removed from current pressures and restraints. It is true, of course, that much research for this book has been done from available official records, the ultimate source of written history. But even more has been drawn from the vivid recollections of the Cavalrymen who fought, tasted the brassy bile of fear, shared the fierce exultation of victory, or were drenched in the dark despair of death.
This volume contains the memoirs of a fighting team—the FIRST TEAM. It is a memory of combat; no doubt it is imperfect as all memory is, but nonetheless it is real for those who were there, for those who can fill in the inevitable gaps." />
