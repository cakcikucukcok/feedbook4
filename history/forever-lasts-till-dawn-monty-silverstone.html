Kirkus review
In a small Ukrainian village they dance, two beautiful girls from poverty-stricken families. They dont dance for joy or happiness. They dance to supplement their parents meager earnings. Joy seems very far away.
These two beautiful young women cant dance in public without attracting attention, sometimes of the worst kind. Trapped in a web of deceit, sex, and tyranny, the two friends flee, seeking a new life in England, where they settle in Londons notorious Soho district. 
London in the twentieth century proves fertile ground for the two young women. Finally they succeed in their endeavors and reach the heights of success that they could only dream of upon arriving in a new country. 
Success comes with a price, with both women exposed to setbacks, cunning adversaries, and tragedy. The happiness and love they deserve threatens to elude them. Will they ever dance for joy?" />
