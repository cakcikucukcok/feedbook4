  <title>Not just a ditty - Emanuele Merlino</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Gotifredo Mameli dei Mannelli, better known as Goffredo Mameli (Genoa, 5 September 1827 - Rome, 6 July 1849) is the prototype of the young and handsome hero. Tormented by his dreams of a free and united Italy, he began fighting at a very young age. He - a Genoese - with the vivid example of young Gianbattista Perasso, the Balilla, in mind. From the patriotic protests to the war waged in the field, the step was short. In 1848 he was at the Five Days of Milan, then captain of Garibaldi&amp;rsquo;s army in Rome. As a Lieutenant of the &amp;ldquo;Hero of the Two Worlds&amp;rdquo; during the French siege of the Roman Republic, he was shot in the leg by the enemy. The wound became infected and Mameli died of septicemia on July 6, 1849, at 7:30 in the morning at the Trinit&amp;agrave; dei Pellegrini hospital. On September 10, 1847 he had written a song that would be set to music by Michele Novaro. The first verse reads: &amp;laquo;Brothers of Italy, Italy has awakened... &amp;raquo;. Today it is Italy&amp;rsquo;s national anthem.&amp;nbsp;" />
