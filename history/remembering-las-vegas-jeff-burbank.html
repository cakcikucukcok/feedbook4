  <title>Remembering Las Vegas - Jeff Burbank</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;DIV&gt;The largest city in the United States to be developed entirely within the twentieth century, Las Vegas has always been a unique place. From its beginnings, when two town sites competed to become the new community rising from the desert, to its modern status as a tourism and entertainment center, Las Vegas has always been a town that took chances and seized opportunities. With a selection of fine historic images from his best-selling book Historic Photos of Las Vegas, Jeff Burbank provides a valuable and revealing historical retrospective on the growth and development of Las Vegas. Remembering Las Vegas captures this story through still photography selected from the finest collections, a visual record of the city&amp;#8217;s history presented in more than a hundred historic photographs. From a dusty tent city to the glittering lights of the most popular tourist destination in the country, these images tell of railroads and ranchers, the Hoover Dam and the Vegas Strip, mining and gambling, visionaries and star performers. Historic events and everyday life are preserved in vivid black-and-white images to tell the story of one of America&amp;#8217;s most exciting cities.&lt;/div&gt;" />
