  <title>Courage and Valor, Above and Beyond - Edwin C. Tingstrom</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Ed Tingstrom is passionate for history which has led to considerable study of U.S. history with emphases on military history.  However he has detected inconsistencies in the recording of historical events which led mim to ask questions.  He would research and ferret out the answers by utilizing the National Archives, Library of Congress and other institutions to provide the answers he sought.
History has always been and will always be my passion.  My quest is to share this passion with the younger generations in hopes of igniting a similar spark in them.  History lives in all of us; all we have to do is seek the truth and remember.
Mr. Tingstrom is a life member of the Veterans of Foreign Wars (VFW) and the Disabled American Veterans (DAV).  He enjoys giving lectures in history and military service at local high schools and colleges, as well as serving as a docent at the VFW museum, which houses a collection of vintage poster art and war memorabilia dating back to the turn of the twenth century.
This is his first book 
This book is dedicated to my wife Deirdre Whose constant encouragement and love provided me with the strength and conviction to continue.
To Professor Ransford Hopkins, Professor of History, Moorpark College, California, who lit the spark, which turned into a roaring fire to write this book, and to seek out history were ever it is found and share it with others." />
