  <title>Let My People Go - Sam Lipski, Suzanne D Rutland</title>
      <meta name="description" content="For 50 years, until the Berlin Wall fell in 1989, the Soviet Union ran a campaign of repression, imprisonment, political trials and terror against its 3 million Jews. In Australia, political leaders and the Jewish community contributed significantly to the international protest movement which eventually triumphed over Moscow&#39;s tyranny and led to the modern Exodus of Soviet Jews to Israel and other countries.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Lipski and Rutland make this largely unknown Australian story come alive with a combination of passion, personal experience and ground-breaking research.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot;The struggle for the freedom of Soviet Jewry was one of the most powerful displays of strength and solidarity by the world Jewish community... even those intimately familiar with the struggle will be surprised to discover in Let My People Go how the Australian Jewish community and its leaders were among the campaign&#39;s initiators, and how they saw it through to its successful conclusion. This is a unique testament to how a small group can play a big role in history.&amp;quot; - Natan Sharansky, Chairman Jewish Agency for Israel, Prisoner of Zion (1977-86)" />
