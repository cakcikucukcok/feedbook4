  <title>Enemy on the Euphrates - Ian Rutledge</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;In 1920 an Arab revolt came perilously close to inflicting a shattering defeat upon the British Empire&amp;amp;#8217;s forces occupying Iraq after the Great War. A huge peasant army besieged British garrisons and bombarded them with captured artillery. British columns and armoured trains were ambushed and destroyed, and gunboats were captured or sunk. Britain&amp;amp;#8217;s quest for oil was one of the principal reasons for its continuing occupation of Iraq. However, with around 131,000 Arabs in arms at the height of the conflict, the British were very nearly driven out. Only a massive infusion of Indian troops prevented a humiliating rout. Enemy on the Euphrates is the definitive account of the most serious armed uprising against British rule in the twentieth century. Bringing central players such as Winston Churchill, T. E. Lawrence and Gertrude Bell vividly to life, Ian Rutledge&amp;amp;#8217;s masterful account is a powerful reminder of how Britain&amp;amp;#8217;s imperial objectives sowed the seeds of Iraq&amp;amp;#8217;s tragic history. &#39;Ian Rutledge&#39;s brilliant book reveals the folly and delusion of invading Iraq.

While offering abundant detail on military operations, lines of communications and warfare tactics, Enemy on the Euphrates also makes for a very lively and human-centred read of imperial history. Populated by a remarkable crowd of spies, diplomats, soldiers, clerics and tribal leaders, Rutledge s account displays almost a novelist s taste for intrigue, espionage, gunboat diplomacy, personal hardship and murder.&#39; BBC History Magazine &#39;An excellently produced book that admirably succeeds in illuminating an important episode in British imperial history&#39; History Today &#39;The description of the military campaign is masterful ... maintains a high level of suspense&#39; Peter Sluglett, author of Britain in Iraq: Contriving King and Country &#39;This gripping narrative brings to life the human side of these violent events through vivid descriptions and anecdotes.&#39; Charles Tripp, author of The Power and the People: Paths of Resistance in the Middle East &#39;[A] rare treasure that combines a fascinating account of important historical events with penetrating analysis.
