  <title>The Last Century of Sea Power: From Washington to Tokyo, 1922-1945 - H. P. Willmott</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;In this second volume of his history of naval power in the 20th century, H. P. Willmott follows the fortunes of the established seafaring nations of Europe along with two upstarts-the United States and Japan. Emerging from World War I in command of the seas, Great Britain saw its supremacy weakened through neglect and in the face of more committed rivals. Britain&#39;s grand Coronation Review of 1937 marked the apotheosis of a sea power slipping into decline. Meanwhile, Britain&#39;s rivals and soon-to-be enemies were embarking on significant naval building programs that would soon change the nature of war at sea in ways that neither they nor their rivals anticipated. By the end of a new world war, the United States had taken command of two oceans, having placed its industrial might behind technologies that further defined the arena of naval power above and below the waves, where stealth and the ability to strike at great distance would soon rewrite the rules of war and of peace. This splendid volume further enhances Willmott&#39;s stature as the dean of naval historians.&lt;/P&gt;" />
