  <title>Kim Philby - Tim Milne</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Kim Philby, the so-called Third Man in the Cambridge spy ring, was the Cold War&#39;s most infamous traitor, a Soviet spy at the heart of British intelligence. Philby joined Britain&#39;s secret service MI6 during the war and went on to head the section tasked with rooting out Russian spies before becoming the service&#39;s chief liaison officer with the CIA. He betrayed hundreds of British and US agents to the Russians and compromised numerous operations inside the Soviet Union. Tim Milne was Philby&#39;s closest and oldest friend. They studied at Westminster School together and when Philby joined MI6 he immediately recruited Milne as his deputy. Philby&#39;s treachery was a huge blow to Milne and, after he retired, he wrote a highly revealing description of Philby&#39;s time in the secret service. Publication of the memoirs was banned by MI6 but, after Milne&#39;s death in 2010, his family were determined that this insider&#39;s account of the Philby affair be published. Edited to include newly released top-secret documents showing how the KGB&#39;s &#39;master spy&#39; managed to fool MI6 even after he defected to Moscow, this is the final word on one of the world&#39;s most notorious spies by the MI6 colleague who knew him best, the insider account of the Philby affair that Britain&#39;s spy chiefs did not want you to read." />
