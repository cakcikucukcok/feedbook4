  <title>The 5Th of July - R.K. Lindsey Jr.</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Robert K. Lindsey is a keiki o ka ina, a child of the land, born in Hilo on the biggest Hawaiian island, and raised in Waimea at the foothills of the Kohala mountains. Waimea was a quiet and quaint paniolo (cattle) town when he was growing up there, and Parker Ranch was the foundation of the community. And though the place has changed across time, its beauty still abounds. Lindsey says he suffers from island fever, and Im glad I do. Mark Twain described Hawaii as the loveliest fleet of islands that lies anchored in any ocean. Twain is one reason Ive never ventured far from home. He convinced me early on that all I need is right here. Im stuck to this rock called Hawaii forever.
In his work life, Lindsey has strived to serve the interests of his lhui (people) to the best of his abilities, first as a social worker with the Family Court of the Third Circuit, then as a park ranger with the National Park Service at Puukohol Heiau National Historic Site. He also served as the land assets directorHawaii Island with Kamehameha Schools (19942004)and is currently a trustee with the Office of Hawaiian Affairs (20052013). He is also a Hawaiian Home Lands lessee (19862085). 
Lindsey believes that as Hawaiian Americans living in a globalized world, for the sake of Mother Earth and our children, the pono (right) thing for us to do is to let bygones be bygones and to forgive but not forget the sins of yesteryears that were committed against us. We must live joyously in the moment and look with hope and optimism to the future . . . Its said the one constant in life is change. One of the lesser fictionalized characters in The 5th of July is Abigail Hathaway McMoore. Her takeaway lesson for us is this: for the sake of our children and the children of the world, we should not be bitter toward change but embrace it, be its advocate, not its victim; its champion, not tormentor; its friend, not adversary. As a contemporary Hawaiian, I subscribe to that philosophy.
The 5th of July is Lindseys second book. His first title, Latitude 20.04N Longitude 155.71W was published in 2013." />
