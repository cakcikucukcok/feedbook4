  <title>The Special Relationship Between the United Kingdom of Great Britain and the United States of America - Francis S E Codjoe Jnr.</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The Special Relationship between Britain and America is not based on sentiments or any value. It is not a political pendulum that swings high or low depending upon the chemistry between an American President and a British Prime Minister. The Anglo-American relationship is grounded on an Eternal Truth.  This truth, which reveals the identities of the British and Americans, is concealed in their national emblems  the Royal Coat of Arms and the Great Seal of the USA.   These crests are pregnant with mysteries.  The Pyramid on the Reverse side of  the Great Seal has nothing to do with the Illuminati nor the New World Order.  Commentators wrongly suggest that the exceptional relationship between America and  Britain is dead. These experts, who adore Monnets European Project, claim Britain is irrelevant on the international stage.  So, America should treat Britain just like any other European nation. Britain is unique among the EU member states. Here is the unknown truth.  A British Secret Service Agent wrote about European integration and its future before Jean Monnet, the brain behind the EU Project, was born. Our understanding of EUs existence and Britains membership of it would not be complete without the legacy of the Intelligence Officer.
A free religion is the parent of a free state, and a free state of a free school. A people who are not wise enough to take care of their own religion, are very poorly prepared to be the guardians of liberties. When a nation loses her religion, she loses the right arm of power and the ability to preserve freedom. According to the Intelligence Officer, Back to the Bible should be a patriotic, as well as a religious cry; for the preservation of our liberties, and our cherished institutions, depends much upon the maintenance of the Bible-taught heart-principles and stout convictions of our fathers." />
