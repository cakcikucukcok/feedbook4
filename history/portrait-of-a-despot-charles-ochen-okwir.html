  <title>Portrait of a Despot - Charles Ochen Okwir</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;US Secretary of State Madeline Albright once described them as the New Breed of African leaders.  Ugandas ruler General Yoweri Museveni was one of them.  In Portrait of a Despot, the contention, a very passionate one at that, is that Gen. Museveni is no more than a Modern Despot; a slightly more sophisticated version of Idi Amin; the type who lives and thrives in that grey area of politics beyond which you either become a democrat or an autocratic dictator.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The book also examines how Modern Despots like George Bush Jnr, Yoweri Museveni, Meles Zenawi, Zine El-Abidine Ben Ali, Tony Blair, and many others who might be thriving quietly in your own country use Deceit, Public Relations, Patronage, Nepotism, Disenfranchisement, and above all, the Law as a tool of political oppression.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With solid evidence from and or reference to Gen. Musevenis twenty five years of egregious rule in Uganda, the book demonstrates how the mighty Portrait of a Despot hanging menacingly over every strand of life in a given country can have disastrous long term consequences on democracy, good governance, and the development of State institutions.  Finally, it brings you to the Scene of Crime in some truly epic political battles between President Museveni and the countrys opposition parties and leaders.&lt;/p&gt;" />
