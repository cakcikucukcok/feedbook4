  <title>D-Day 1944 - Anthony Tucker-Jones</title>
      <meta name="description" content="D-Day was unprecedented. An invasion of this scale and magnitude had never been carried out before. The landings in North Africa, Sicily and Italy were of limited scope by comparison; if they had failed it would not have been a complete disaster, whereas Normandy heralded the long-awaited Second Front. This dramatic new study investigates the great feats of unique problem solving that enabled each side to maintain success dealing with such an important invasion. Military historian Anthony Tucker-Jones brings his expert eye to bear on the D-Day landings and subsequent Normandy campaign, re-assessing the technical ingenuity required through the eyes of those who fought there, and vividly revealing how each side managed, whether dealing the challenges of crossing the Channel safely or in defence of the French coast." />
