  <title>Algerian Literature - Abdelkader Aoudjit</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;The only up-to-date and comprehensive text and reader of Algerian literature available in English, &lt;I&gt;Algerian Literature: A Reader’s Guide and Anthology&lt;/I&gt; offers the reader a historical and critical overview of the literature from the early twentieth century to the present, introduces Algerian authors, and provides selections from a wide range of their writings, many translated here for the first time. It begins with an overview chapter that charts the evolution of Algerian literature and puts it in its proper historical context, followed by five thematic chapters: decolonization and cultural affirmation, the War of Independence, modernization and its discontents, emigration, and history. The chapters begin with introductions on the themes under discussion and the selections are preceded by biographies of the authors, as well as detailed summaries of the larger works from which they are extracted. Finally, each chapter concludes with a bibliography and sources for readers seeking additional information and insight. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;The selections included in &lt;I&gt;Algerian Literature: A Reader’s Guide and Anthology&lt;/I&gt; have been carefully chosen to reflect the richness and diversity of Algerian literature. Accordingly, they are extracted from various literary genres: novels, plays, and poems. Furthermore, they are from works that belong to different literary movements: realism, modernism, and postmodernism. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;The variety and the outstanding quality of the selections, along with the superb introductions, summaries, and biographies make &lt;I&gt;Algerian Literature: A Reader’s Guide and Anthology&lt;/I&gt; an ideal text for courses in Algerian, Francophone, and world literature courses. It will also be of interest to general readers outside the classroom who want to broaden their literary horizons.&lt;/P&gt;" />
