  <title>A Covenant People - James P. Eckman</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The twentieth century witnessed harsh anti-Semitism, vicious pogroms, and the unimaginable Holocaust. Over a third of the worlds Jews were killed. Yet, today the largest concentration of Jews resides in Israela modern miracle. Theologian and historian Dr. Jim Eckman presents a riveting history of Gods covenant people from the initial promises God made to Abraham to the establishment of the modern state of Israel in 1948. Through enslavement in ancient Egypt, the conquest under Joshua, the establishment of the monarchy under David, the brutal exiles under Assyria and Babylon to the tragedies of Diaspora Judaism, the Jewish people have survived. For almost 1,900 years, the Jews were dispersed and despised as Christ-killers. But, by the late ninteenth century, there was evidence of a change in the worlds perception of the Jews. How and why did they begin their historic trek back to their ancient homeland? Eckman identifies ten major historical events that reawakened the West to the necessity of a homeland for the Jewish people. As he weaves history together with the theological portrait of our covenant-making, covenant-keeping God, Eckman provides an indispensable handbook for understanding todays Middle East and the importance of the Jewish people to Gods eternal plan for this planet." />
