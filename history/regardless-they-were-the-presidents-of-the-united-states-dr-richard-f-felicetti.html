  <title>Regardless, They Were the Presidents of the United States - Dr. Richard F. Felicetti</title>
      <meta name="description" content="My name is Dr. Richard F. Felicetti.  I have always been interested in the history of the United States, especially Presidents of the United States.  In the early 1960s I started and still do today, collecting Presidential Campaign Buttons.  My professional career was in the Field of Education.  After two years of Military Service, I began my professional career.  I was a Teacher, Principal at three levels-Grade School, Junior High School and High School, Director of a Head Start Summer Program, Adjunct College Professor and Superintendent of a Grade School District.  I retired as Superintendent of School District 206, Bloom Township High School in Chicago Heights, Illinois, the high school district that I graduated from in 1951.
When I graduated from high school, I went on to receive my Bachelors and Masters Degrees from Northern Illinois University.  I received my Ph.D. from Walden University in 1993.
When I retired from education in 1994, I asked myself what can I do that would be of interest.  With my hobby of collecting Presidential Campaign Buttons, I thought it would be fun, exciting and certainly interesting to visit all the gravesites of the deceased Presidents of the United States.  I began my journey in 1999 and completed it in 2012.  During that time, I have visited every gravesite of our deceased presidents and in some cases I have visited them on many occasions.
When I visited the gravesites, I would take thirty to forty photographs of them.  From the very beginning, I knew that someday I would write a book covering my thoughts and experiences that I had while on was on my journey.  I have now completed my book.  I have written a story about each visit to the presidential gravesites.  To go along with each story, I would like to have certain photographs printed of the presidential gravesites.  In addition to writing about my visits to the presidential gravesites, I have written my Introduction, Epilogue, Acknowledgements, Dedication and also About the Author. I do feel my story will create interest, make a person smile and at times bring tears to the eyes of the reader.  It is a story that was heart warming for me to do and I am hopeful that I may share it with the world.
I presently live in Peoria, Arizona with my wife, Sharon.  As we continue to travel, we will continue to visit presidential gravesites.  Every visit is different, always meaningful, moving, sometimes sad, but always tells me that my story has to be shared." />
