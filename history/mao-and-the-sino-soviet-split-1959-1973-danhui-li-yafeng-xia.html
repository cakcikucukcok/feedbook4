  <title>Mao and the Sino-Soviet Split, 1959–1973 - Danhui Li, Yafeng Xia</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;In the twenty-first century, students of Cold War history are fortunate to have the fruits of several major works on the Sino-Soviet split by European and American scholars. What is lacking in English literature, however, is a book based on international documentation, especially Chinese archival documents that tell the story from the Chinese perspective.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Based on archival materials from several countries&amp;mdash;particularly China&amp;mdash;and more than twenty years of research on the subject, two prominent Chinese historians, Danhui Li and Yafeng Xia, offer a comprehensive look at the Sino&amp;ndash;Soviet split from 1959, when visible cracks appeared in the Sino-Soviet alliance, to 1973, when China&amp;rsquo;s foreign policy changed from an &amp;ldquo;alliance with the Soviet Union to oppose the United States&amp;rdquo; to &amp;ldquo;aligning with the United States to oppose the Soviet Union.&amp;rdquo; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-style:italic;&quot;&gt;Mao and the Sino-Soviet Split, 1959&amp;ndash;1973: A New History&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; is a reevaluation of the history of the Sino-Soviet split and offers the first comprehensive account of it from a Chinese perspective.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;This book, together with its prequel &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-style:italic;&quot;&gt;Mao and the Sino&amp;ndash;Soviet Partnership, 1945&amp;ndash;1959: A New History&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;, is important because any changes in Sino-Soviet relations at the time affected, and to a great extent determined, the fate of the socialist bloc. More importantly, it directly impacted and transformed the international political situation during the Cold War. These two books promise to be a reevaluation of the history of the Sino-Soviet alliance from its birth to its demise. These fascinating books will be a crucial resource for all those interested in the topic and will stand as the definitive work on the Sino-Soviet alliance for years to come.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;" />
