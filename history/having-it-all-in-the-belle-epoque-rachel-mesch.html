  <title>Having It All in the Belle Epoque - Rachel Mesch</title>
      <meta name="description" content="At once deeply historical and surprisingly timely, &lt;I&gt;Having it All in the Belle Epoque&lt;/I&gt; shows how the debates that continue to captivate high-achieving women in America and Europe can be traced back to the early 1900s in France. The first two photographic magazines aimed at women, &lt;I&gt;Femina&lt;/I&gt; and &lt;I&gt;La Vie Heureuse&lt;/I&gt; created a female role model who could balance age-old convention with new equalities. Often referred to simply as the &quot;modern woman,&quot; this captivating figure embodied the hopes and dreams as well as the most pressing internal conflicts of large numbers of French women during what was a period of profound change. Full of never-before-studied images of the modern French woman in action, &lt;I&gt;Having it All&lt;/I&gt; shows how these early magazines exploited new photographic technologies, artistic currents, and literary trends to create a powerful model of French femininity, one that has exerted a lasting influence on French expression.
This book introduces and explores the concept of Belle Epoque literary feminism, a product of the elite milieu from which the magazines emerged. Defined by its refusal of political engagement, this feminism was nevertheless preoccupied with expanding women&#39;s roles, as it worked to construct a collective fantasy of female achievement. Through an astute blend of historical research, literary criticism, and visual analysis, Mesch&#39;s study of women&#39;s magazines and the popular writers associated with them offers an original window onto a bygone era that can serve as a framework for ongoing debates about feminism, femininity, and work-life tensions." />
