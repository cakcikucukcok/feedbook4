  <title>The Greatest Fall from Grace - Jessy King</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;In the beginning, there is an almighty power, known by the name the Lord God, his royal majesty. His greatest creation, Lucifer, stands on his right and is the almightys go-to divine servant. The almighty does ask Lucifer to complete many tasks, such as creating the heavens and the earth. But Lucifer also has a few ideas of his own, some of which are cause for speculation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;em&gt;The Greatest Fall from Grace&lt;/em&gt;, the most devilish character in history experiences mind-bending adventures through time and space, breaching heavenly and hellish bodies both physical and otherworldly. Lucifer understands that being the first of anything is difficult, but being the first created to fall from grace is even more difficult. Trying to redeem himself and trying hard not to fall in love, are challenges he faces.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This drama follows Lucifer through his lifes adventures and answers the question of whether or not he, the others, and earth will survive the catastrophes this universe and beyond can create.&lt;/p&gt;" />
