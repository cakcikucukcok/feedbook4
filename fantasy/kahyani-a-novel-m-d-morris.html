  <title>Kahyani: A Novel - M. D. Morris</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The Dajhanin are enigmatic people who live in the rugged Ojberdine-Haijlan Mountains. Ajlek, a member of this kind and gentle race, lived in the middle of civilization most of his life until he was called to action to help the Dajhanin. He is now Kahyani-their leader-and he has served as such for six peace-filled years ... until now. At first, Ajlek believes random thrill-seekers are climbing into Dajhanin territory to create mischief, but he soon discovers that the problem goes far deeper than mere fun and games. To his horror, the trail leads all the way to the highest levels of civilized government and involves people capable of annihilating the Dajhanin. To stop what&#39;s happening, Ajlek must go against the wishes of the Dajhanin and travel to the heart of the nation&#39;s capital, where he&#39;s most vulnerable-and where, if things go wrong, he could disappear forever. True, Ajlek is honorable and compassionate, but how far is he willing to go to defend himself and the people he loves?" />
