&lt;br /&gt;
Beartown is a town just about to be condemned to insignificance. It&amp;rsquo;s economy has been stagnant for years and people are slowly leaving for better opportunities outside. It has one more chance to redeem itself though. It&amp;rsquo;s junior hockey team has made it to the semifinals. Victory for the team means more jobs and economic opportunities for the town. But Kevin, its 17-year-old star player is being blamed for the assault on a 15-year-old girl who happens to be the daughter of the team&amp;rsquo;s general manager. Victory is at stake, and so is the whole town&amp;rsquo;s future. Can the town go beyond its mob thinking and sports fanaticism to deal with the crisis?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;A Brief Look Inside:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
EVERY GOOD BOOK CONTAINS A WORLD FAR DEEPER&lt;br /&gt;
than the surface of its pages. The characters and their world come alive,&lt;br /&gt;
and the characters and its world still live on.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Conversation Starters&lt;/i&gt; is peppered with questions designed to&lt;br /&gt;
bring us beneath the surface of the page&lt;br /&gt;
and invite us into the world that lives on.&lt;br /&gt;
