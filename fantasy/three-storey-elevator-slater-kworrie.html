  <title>Three Storey Elevator - Slater Kworrie</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The title of this book serves as nothing more than a play on words for the grammatical content that separates the front cover from the back and is essentially what it states in the headline.
Three totally separate stories of three totally separate individuals whose lives are transformed by chance events that occur during the course of a perfectly normal day of work and leisure and become intermingled with others who are touched by the ripple or butterfly effect of those events. 
&#39;The Cellar&#39; is set in the sixties and involves a young couple who inherit an old dilapidated cottage with an alleged dark history. Mike Simmons accidently stumbles on a time portal in the cellar which allows him to travel back and forward to a specific place during the Second World War where the effects of an unexpected incident are dragged back into the present with dire consequences.
&#39;Money For Nothing&#39; mirrors the effects of what can happen to a young man&#39;s friendship with a group of vagrants who befriend him, when he finds a winning Lottery ticket and their lives are catapulted into a new dimensional lifestyle. Money really does become the root of all evil as the recipient of that ticket finds out to his dismay.
&#39;Power and the Gory&#39; steps into the criminal underworld of a one horse town where a series of events and in- fighting touch the lives of three unsuspecting people in a spectacular way and brings mayhem to the main street. 
In the time it takes a lift to move between floors, a million things could have altered the course of what you thought your day was going to turn out to be. It can take you up or take you down. I hope having read this book your pleasure is elevated in some small way." />

    	<p>The title of this book serves as nothing more than a play on words for the grammatical content that separates the front cover from the back and is essentially what it states in the headline. Three totally separate stories of three totally separate individuals whose lives are transformed by chance events that occur during the course of a perfectly normal day of work and leisure and become intermingled with others who are touched by the ripple or butterfly effect of those events. 'The Cellar' is set in the sixties and involves a young couple who inherit an old dilapidated cottage with an alleged dark history. Mike Simmons accidently stumbles on a time portal in the cellar which allows him to travel back and forward to a specific place during the Second World War where the effects of an unexpected incident are dragged back into the present with dire consequences. 'Money For Nothing' mirrors the effects of what can happen to a young man's friendship with a group of vagrants who befriend him, when he finds a winning Lottery ticket and their lives are catapulted into a new dimensional lifestyle. Money really does become the root of all evil as the recipient of that ticket finds out to his dismay. 'Power and the Gory' steps into the criminal underworld of a one horse town where a series of events and in- fighting touch the lives of three unsuspecting people in a spectacular way and brings mayhem to the main street. In the time it takes a lift to move between floors, a million things could have altered the course of what you thought your day was going to turn out to be. It can take you up or take you down. I hope having read this book your pleasure is elevated in some small way.</p>
