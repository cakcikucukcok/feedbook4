  <title>Seven Bridges - Jolene Polyack</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Imaginative story about a being who we first meet in Atlantis. As he progresses through each of his seven lives, he experiences new circumstances and situations each designed to provide a new ribbon of knowledge and perspective. During his procession he has the opportunity to interact in a variety of relationships with other beings, some that he has known previously. At the end of each life he finds himself in a place of pure whiteness, the bridge, where there is no body, only thoughts and a guide helping him to reflect upon what he has learnedand determine whether it is time to make use of his understanding in another, mysterious way.
I absolutely loved Seven Bridges! It drew me in from the first chapter and as I finished each one I couldnt wait to get to the next to see where it would go. I was intrigued by the way each chapter was unique to itself, yet followed his journey in a surprising and unexpected way. I loved the different settings and time periods and I felt like I was there with him.  The book was quick to read, with enough details to understand what was going on and who he was interacting with, but not so much that I got bogged down in details. I didnt want the story to end, I hope theres another Seven Bridges that he has to cross!" />
