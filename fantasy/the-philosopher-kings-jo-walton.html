  <title>The Philosopher Kings - Jo Walton</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;From acclaimed, award-winning author Jo Walton: &lt;i&gt;Philosopher Kings, &lt;/i&gt;a tale of gods and humans, and the surprising things they have to learn from one another. Twenty years have elapsed since the events of &lt;i&gt;The Just City.&lt;/i&gt; The City, founded by the time-traveling goddess Pallas Athene, organized on the principles espoused in Plato&#39;s &lt;i&gt;Republic&lt;/i&gt; and populated by people from all eras of human history, has now split into five cities, and low-level armed conflict between them is not unheard-of. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The god Apollo, living (by his own choice) a human life as &quot;Pythias&quot; in the City, his true identity known only to a few, is now married and the father of several children. But a tragic loss causes him to become consumed with the desire for revenge. Being Apollo, he goes handling it in a seemingly rational and systematic way, but it&#39;s evident, particularly to his precocious daughter Arete, that he is unhinged with grief.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Along with Arete and several of his sons, plus a boatload of other volunteers--including the now fantastically aged Marsilio Ficino, the great humanist of Renaissance Florence--Pythias/Apollo goes sailing into the mysterious Eastern Mediterranean of pre-antiquity to see what they can find--possibly the man who may have caused his great grief, possibly communities of the earliest people to call themselves &quot;Greek.&quot; What Apollo, his daughter, and the rest of the expedition will discover...will change everything. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the Publisher&#39;s request, this title is being sold without Digital Rights Management Software (DRM) applied.&lt;/p&gt;" />
