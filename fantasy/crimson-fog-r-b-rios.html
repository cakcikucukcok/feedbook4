  <title>Crimson Fog - R. B. Rios</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Kikyo was the girl in the invisible bubble, she was quiet, shy, always kept to herself, her only friend in the world was pushed away from her years ago after something terrible happened to her. She had no memories of the attack that left her broken, so she built her bubble where she was safe and no one could touch her, until her world came crashing down on her. Her mother passed and now Kikyo was totally alone in this world. The bubble could no longer save her, so she ran from her demons amid the gang infested streets of Chicago. Tristian, her only life line to normalcy was grateful to be in her life once
again. When they discovered the truth of her incident they never thought the impossible was possible. But just as Kikyo was finding her way in the world again, the mysterious boy with the violet eyes came to intervene and set her path in a new direction. Her nightmares had stopped, but the demons were real. The only way to survive was to leave her beloved Tristian and forever side with Angel Xavier. Can true love conquer all, or is that just in fairy tales?" />
