  <title>Songs of the Earth - Elspeth Cooper</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Book of Eador&lt;/i&gt;, Abjurations 12:14, is very clear: Suffer ye not the life of a witch. For a thousand years, the Church Knights have obeyed that commandment, sending to the stake anyone who can hear the songs of the earth. There are no exceptions, not even for one of their own.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Novice Knight Gair can hear music no one else can, beautiful, terrible music: music with power. In the Holy City, that can mean only one thing: death by fire--until an unlikely intervention gives him a chance to flee the city and escape the flames.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With the Church Knights and their witchfinder hot on his heels, Gair hasn&#39;t time to learn how to use the power growing inside him, but if he doesn&#39;t master it, that power will tear him apart. His only hope is the secretive Guardians of the Veil, though centuries of persecution have almost destroyed their Order, and the few Guardians left have troubles of their own.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the Veil between worlds is weakening, and behind it, the Hidden Kingdom, ever-hungry for dominion over the daylight realm, is stirring. Though he is far from ready, Gair will find himself fighting for his own life, for everyone within the Order of the Veil, and for the woman he has come to love.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the Publisher&#39;s request, this title is being sold without Digital Rights Management Software (DRM) applied.&lt;/p&gt;" />
