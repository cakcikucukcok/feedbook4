  <title>Dragon Heart - Cecelia Holland</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;In &lt;i&gt;Dragon Heart, &lt;/i&gt;Cecelia Holland, America&#39;s most distinguished historical novelist steps fully into the realm of fantasy and makes it her own.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Where the Cape of the Winds juts into the endless sea, there is Castle Ocean, and therein dwells the royal family that has ruled it from time immemorial. But an eastern Empire has risen, and its forces have reached the castle. King Reymarro is dead in battle, and by the new treaty, Queen Marioza must marry one of the Emperor&#39;s brothers. While Marioza delays, her youngest son, Jeon, goes on a journey in search of his mute twin, Tirza, who needs to be present for the wedding.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As Jeon and Tirza return by sea, their ship is attacked by a powerful dragon, red as blood and big as the ship. Thrown into the water, Tirza clings to the dragon, and after an underwater journey, finds herself alone with the creature in an inland sea pool. Surprisingly, she is able to talk to the beast, and understand it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So begins a saga of violence, destruction, and death, of love and monsters, human and otherwise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the Publisher&#39;s request, this title is being sold without Digital Rights Management Software (DRM) applied.&lt;/p&gt;" />
