Fracony, a super-civilization that visited Earth in the past, built models showing that this apocalypse, triggered by human virus experiments, was inevitable.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
Are Fracony&amp;#39;s models right? The only human that could communicate with Fracony is Clara. Her qualities were detected when she was only few months old and she was trained all her life for the challenge to lead the world if such a scenario hits mankind. But training could not foresee everything, there are too many moving parts, and Fracony might have their own plans. Clara must take drastic action to contain the virus.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
Will she make the right choice?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />
