      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Anna is a student surviving the city, and she lives by a simple credo, &amp;ldquo;Never play their game; their game is always rigged.&amp;rdquo; For every man she has ever known, it&amp;rsquo;s a saying that has served her well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Especially when Anna becomes lost to the dark heart of the city. She finds herself hunted by Dreamers&amp;mdash;artists, both good and evil, who construct new worlds&amp;mdash;within a complex community that threatens to undermine reality itself. When Anna learns that she&amp;rsquo;s an Undreamer with powers she cannot yet comprehend, she must travel through their strange and treacherous creations to discover that there&amp;rsquo;s as much beauty in life as there is darkness. As her existence spirals into wonder and danger, Anna must look deep within herself and face the horrors of her own past, to save her old world as well as her new one.&lt;/p&gt;" />
