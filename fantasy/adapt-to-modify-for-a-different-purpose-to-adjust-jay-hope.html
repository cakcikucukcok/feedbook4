  <title>Adapt: to Modify for a Different Purpose; to Adjust - Jay Hope</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Bodhi Grey grew up hard, caring for himself when nobody else would. As an adult, he wanted to protect those that couldnt protect themselves. Thats why he became a SEAL and why when the opportunity presented itself, he jumped at the chance to become something more, but never in his wildest dreams did he expect it to be like this . . . so all consuming. His beast is wild and wont be controlled. When introduced to Jayden, his beast becomes possessive. But Bodhi knows that Jayden isnt the type to be ruled by a man, so he must work to tame him. 
Jayden Meyers isnt like most girls. Shes the lead singer in a rock band and looks the part with her many piercings and tattoos. Shes always enjoyed the company of men over women for both friendship and sex. She doesnt do relationships . . . that is until Bodhi enters her life. He makes her feel things that she never expected, and shes not entirely sure that she likes it. To make matters worse, shes scared to death of his beast and cant understand why anyone would alter themselves in that way. Jayden vows to stay away from him, but as bodies start turning up and her protection is needed, she will find it harder and harder to fight the pull between them." />
