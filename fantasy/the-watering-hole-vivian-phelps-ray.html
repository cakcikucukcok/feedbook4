  <title>The Watering Hole - Vivian Phelps Ray</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This is a story about ten teenagers who spent lots of time together, enjoying the summer sun, swimming and exploring. It was one of those beautiful but strange days that no one understands. Maybe it was strange because of the weather. It was 106 degrees in the shade and the old people were saying that this heat was caused by dog days, and that they were
just lasting too long, that the world was coming to an end, and that Jesus was coming back to judge everyone.
The kids found a lovely watering hole on this day, and because it was so hot, they decided to go for a swim. This was such a beautiful and calm area, and since no one else was therethey claimed it, and called it their spot and they went there often.
One day while swimming, one of the girls spotted something shining in the water that appeared to be the sun reflecting on a rock. After taking a closer look, she started to scream and everyone asked what was wrong. She said There is a body in the water. It was a dead lady. She was so beautiful, she had olive colored skin, she was wearing a white sequin dress with matching shoes and purse, and her hair was cut short with bangs. Her purse was opened, which revealed a compact engraved with Mary C. King and an address. There was also a small bottle of perfume inside. The police was called, and before the kids could turn around, the police and the coroner magically appeared. That day, these kids were plunged
into a bizarre situation that demanded answers." />
