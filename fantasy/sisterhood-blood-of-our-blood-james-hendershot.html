  <title>Sisterhood Blood of Our Blood - James Hendershot</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Spiritual drama hides in English history as Lilith, after being blasted into space, finds herself as a newborn baby of an aristocrat in the seventeenth-century English. As she matures, with her past still concealed, she vows to help the penurious, which leads her to invite four new near-starving soon-to-be blood sisters. Fejr claims to be sent from Anns Empire in another reality. Ann instantaneously bonds with these four poverty-stricken girls. Anns father receives official countess documents for these girls from the Danish kings brother. They shockingly discover that one of the destitute girls is truly the French princess, hidden by her royal parents for her protection. While at a special dinner on her behalf, Countess Henrietta Maria is raided by a vagabond that begs for some food. The English prepared to beat and cast him away; however, she postulates that this destitute vagabond be given her food. Upon exiting the restaurant, a disguised Charles I vows to marry Henrietta. The French gave their long-lost princess, now both loved and hated, to become Queen Henrietta Maria of England. They venture through Buckingham Palace as Queen Maria shares and keep her sisterhood vows. The sisters must first develop their social skills and survive like Puritans, which forces the family to the colonies. The sisters vow to serve Lilith (Ann) as they endure hidden worlds, horror, slavery, beatings, and find a road that leads them through many escapades, causing them to leap through the horrors and blood of time, going deep in the earth and through the ages of time. Ann departs and meets Drusilla as they struggle as Roman slaves. She agonizes through starvation, rapes, beatings, yet wins her divine tribulations. She then leads her sisters back to her lost empire, yet surreptitiously things have altered." />
