      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Centuries ago, in a remote countryside sanctuary at the edge of the rainforest in South Wales, Merlinusmore commonly called Merlintook his very first breath. The boy grew to be a bright and curious young man. With his future at his feet, even he couldnt have predicted how his life would change in a heartbeat, the night he watched a falling star land, in awe. Unable to resist touching the liquid contents within its core, Merlin finds himself under attack by the alien substance. He awakens  changed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Endowed with special powers, the young man begins a new life as a demigod in pursuit of making his world a better place. As his control grows, so does his fame; the young magician soon earns the favor of Pope Urban II, who grants him a generous giftand great responsibility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many years later he begins experiencing vivid nightmares of futuristic events. In the twilight of his exceptionally long life, he sees himself as a young man once more. He knows what it means and what must be done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He witnesses his own rebirth in 2013, as the first human clone of the twenty-first century. Can he use this new life to do more good, or will the inherent dangers of this strange, new world overwhelm even his ambitions?&lt;/p&gt;" />
