  <title>Jumper Cable - Piers Anthony</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;In the thirty-third thrilling escapade in Piers Anthony&#39;s rousing Xanth fantasy series, an adventurous arachnid named Jumper must assume human form to save the enchanted realm from a cosmic peril.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A cataclysmic battle between two all-powerful Demons has severed a mystical connection that joins Xanth to our own world. The key to restoring it is hidden within a cryptic prophecy that Jumper discovers when he is suddenly transformed from spider to man. As he sets out to discern the prophecy&#39;s meaning, he gathers about him a half dozen alluring damsels who do their best to help him solve the riddle while vying for his attentions. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But a seductive siren and her demonic consort have determined to use their wiles to lure Jumper and his lovely companions away from their urgent mission.  In a madcap adventure that is alternately harrowing and hilarious, they soon discover that danger, deception, and even true love may be found where they least expect it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In &lt;i&gt;Jumper Cable&lt;/i&gt;, master storyteller Piers Anthony spins a wild and witty web of wonder that is sure to captivate fans of fantastic adventure everywhere!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;At the Publisher&#39;s request, this title is being sold without Digital Rights Management Software (DRM) applied.&lt;/p&gt;" />
