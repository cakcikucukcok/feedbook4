  <title>Settling Sands - Ashe Knite</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Lilontra is born a sorceress and that is enough to brand her a traitor to the crown.&lt;P&gt;
Orphaned and alone, she happens upon another sorceress, Latri, who takes her in and offers her protection. Latri, also persecuted because of her abilities, identifies with the youngster, and the two become quick friends.&lt;P&gt;
But the evil queen is not easily defeated, and Lilontra is left scared and alone once again when her mistress is killed. She must find the strength to keep on living and fulfill Latri&#39;s final wish: to travel to the past and fix the future.&lt;P&gt;
She must first track down the Seven Serpents whom she has never met; for in her time, they have all been killed by the evil queen. When she locates new friends, she also discovers that there&#39;s an enemy lurking in the shadows. Now, she must decide whom she can trust.&lt;P&gt;
As Lilontra tries to navigate the past, the present is approaching. Join her in her journey in the first book of &lt;i&gt;A Serpent&#39;s Path&lt;/i&gt;." />
