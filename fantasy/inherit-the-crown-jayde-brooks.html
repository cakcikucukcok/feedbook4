  <title>Inherit the Crown - Jayde Brooks</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;This heart-racing two-in-1 by fantasy author Jayde Brooks includes the director&#39;s cut of Daughter of Gods and Shadows, previously published, and the next brand-new novel in the trilogy, City of Dark Creatures!&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Daughter of Gods and Shadows&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Eden Reid is not interested in prophesy. The problem is that a doozy of a prophesy is bearing down on her. Such is the case when you&#39;re a twenty-five-year-old from Brooklyn, New York who is about to discover she is an ancient god. A truly formidable demon is gunning for her; a zombie-like pandemic is spreading across the country&lt;i&gt;; &lt;/i&gt;and there is the mysterious, handsome stranger with powers of his own who claims to have been her lover from a time and a life that Eden cannot remember...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;City of Dark Creatures&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Eden had done the impossible--defeated Sakarabru and saved the world from complete annihilation. Yet the demise of the great demon was not enough. With his Brood army still on the loose and a powerful replacement ready to step in, the world is in greater danger than ever before. But not all enemies are outsiders...&lt;/p&gt;" />
