  <title>Path of the Spirit Runner - L.H. Leonard</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;b&gt;Gifted or cursed?&lt;/b&gt;&amp;nbsp;Isobel is a healer, and the Hawks who accepted her, broken and different as she was, need her help. But she must hide the truth behind her healing power.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
John Deighton,&amp;nbsp;&lt;b&gt;The Prophet&lt;/b&gt;, is back in Innis and stoking the embers of bigotry and superstition, scouring the realm and imprisoning mindgifted Aurels. When he corners Isobel, will she fight back or succumb to her old fears and lingering scars of the Beast of Monaughty? Will she answer the call of a healer if it costs her everything she loves?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Far across the sea,&amp;nbsp;&lt;b&gt;Tobias Buchanan&lt;/b&gt;&amp;nbsp;is racing against time to build New Rhynn as a haven for his clan. As the noose of oppression squeezes tighter in Innis, the Hawks may soon be forced to choose between their homeland and their way of life. Can he earn a place for his Hawks amongst the Este of Tallu? Can he prove Rhynns are worthy of their trust?&lt;br /&gt;
Meanwhile, the Este are discovering their own place in the Awakening and the Joining. Spirit runners grow more powerful by the year, and the Mists hover closer over Tallu. But will it be enough when the water rises? Will they be ready before the cycle ends?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Path of the Spirit Runner&lt;/i&gt;&amp;nbsp;is the enthralling continuation of the&amp;nbsp;&lt;i&gt;Rootstock Saga&lt;/i&gt;. Evolution and oppression. Magical mindgifts and dragon science. The characters you loved in&amp;nbsp;&lt;i&gt;Legend of the Storm Hawks&lt;/i&gt;&amp;nbsp;come of age and weave their own threads in the Patterns." />
