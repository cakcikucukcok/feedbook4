  <title>Calypso: by David Sedaris | Conversation Starters - dailyBooks</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;b&gt;Calypso: by David Sedaris | Conversation Starters&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
American comedian and author David Sedaris relases his latest book Calypso. Sedaris writes a new collection of humorous stories on mortality and middle age. Sedaris starts with his purchase of a new beach property in Carolina. His new property is on Carolina coast and he names it his vacation home Sea Section. He had visions of relaxing afternoons with a refreshing drink under the warm Carolina sun. It was perfect. However he realized his vacation will be impossible because he couldn&amp;rsquo;t have a vacation from himself. Sedaris then shares his funny observations about the middle age and life. Sedaris will make the readers laugh the way only family can. His humor comes from that moment when his own body betrays him and he realizes that his life is really made up of the past.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Mail Online praises Sedaris&amp;rsquo;s work and described it as &amp;ldquo;firmly grounded in the present, &amp;nbsp;but with the same sense of twisted nostalgia.&amp;rdquo; Guardian&amp;rsquo;s Hadley Freeman compares Calypso to other books out there and says that it is &amp;ldquo;funnier and more heartbreaking.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;A Brief Look Inside:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
EVERY GOOD BOOK CONTAINS A WORLD FAR DEEPER&lt;br /&gt;
than the surface of its pages. The characters and their world come alive,&lt;br /&gt;
and the characters and its world still live on.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Conversation Starters&lt;/i&gt; is peppered with questions designed to&lt;br /&gt;
bring us beneath the surface of the page&lt;br /&gt;
and invite us into the world that lives on.&lt;br /&gt;
