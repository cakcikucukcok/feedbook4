  <title>Creatures We Dream of Knowing - Andrew Marr</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Creatures We Dream of Knowing&lt;/i&gt; is a compilation of seven heartwarming stories that probe the wonders of creation through the eyes of creatures who ask those they encounter to open their eyes and hearts to their wisdom. &lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;When a young boy receives a plea in a dream from a frightened colt with purple diamond eyes, he embarks on an unforgettable adventure that leads him from the warmth of his bed to a dark horse pasture where he must learn to use his hands and his heart to rescue the abandoned foal. As the collection of short stories continues, a band of unique characters will meet a creature from the depths of the ocean previously unknown to humanity; travel into an oriental carpet with the creatures who live in it; discover a butterfly who wants to end a war; share a dragons story; find out what happens when someone rubs a genies bottle with the wrong hand; and perch in the branches of a tree unlike any other.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Creatures We Dream of Knowing&lt;/i&gt; encourages others to simply imagine what would happen if such beautiful creatures truly existed in our universe. &lt;/p&gt;" />
