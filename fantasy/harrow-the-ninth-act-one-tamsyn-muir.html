  <title>Harrow the Ninth: Act One - Tamsyn Muir</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Can&#39;t wait to read &lt;i&gt;Harrow the Ninth&lt;/i&gt;, the sequel to the sensational, USA Today best-selling novel &lt;i&gt;Gideon the Ninth&lt;/i&gt;? Check out this free ebook preview and read the whole first act early. &lt;i&gt;Harrow the Ninth&lt;/i&gt; is available for pre-order now, and on-sale everywhere August 4, 2020.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;She answered the Emperor&#39;s call.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;She arrived with her arts, her wits, and her only friend.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In victory, her world has turned to ash.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;After rocking the cosmos with her deathly debut, Tamsyn Muir continues the story of the penumbral Ninth House in Harrow the Ninth, a mind-twisting puzzle box of mystery, murder, magic, and mayhem. Nothing is as it seems in the halls of the Emperor, and the fate of the galaxy rests on one woman&#39;s shoulders.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Harrowhark Nonagesimus, last necromancer of the Ninth House, has been drafted by her Emperor to fight an unwinnable war. Side-by-side with a detested rival, Harrow must perfect her skills and become an angel of undeath -- but her health is failing, her sword makes her nauseous, and even her mind is threatening to betray her. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Sealed in the gothic gloom of the Emperor&#39;s Mithraeum with three unfriendly teachers, hunted by the mad ghost of a murdered planet, Harrow must confront two unwelcome questions: is somebody trying to kill her? And if they succeeded, would the universe be better off?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;At the Publisher&#39;s request, this title is being sold without Digital Rights Management Software (DRM) applied.&lt;/p&gt;" />
