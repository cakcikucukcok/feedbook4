  <title>The Demon Hunt - Kris Greene</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Soul-sucking demons. Half-human killers. Doomsday prophesies. No, this isn&#39;t a late-night movie on cable TV. This is Gabriel&#39;s life--or least, what&#39;s left of it--ever since he discovered his true destiny as a warrior knight in the battle against darkness. Once an ordinary college kid studying lost legends in books, Gabriel now finds himself face to face with actual demons. As a warrior, he has no choice but to fight them. And if he screws it up, the world is toast...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A dimensional rift has opened between worlds. Which means more demons--and more death--than you could shake a proverbial stick at. Luckily, Gabriel has just the stick for the job, an ancient trident that gives him awesome demon-bashing powers. To watch his back he has the butt kicking half Demon De Mona and several unlikely heroes who he&#39;s picked up along the way. To make matters more complicated two of Gabriel&#39;s college buddies wind up dead and he finds that the demons aren&#39;t the only ones who want a piece of his hide. The cops want him too--for murder... &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Demon Hunt &lt;/i&gt;is the second book in Kris Greene&#39;s fantasy series Dark Storm.&lt;/p&gt;" />
