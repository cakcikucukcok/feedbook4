  <title>The Undying - Mudrooroo</title>
      <meta name="description" content="A daring and thrilling journey into a fantastical world of shamans, vampires and werebears where aboriginal Dreaming and Gothic horror are woven together to create a powerful and seamless narrative.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I, the stranger with strange habits which make me avoid the full light of day, enter into the warm circle of your fire and will exchange my yarn for your company...&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The stranger, George, tells a story of wonder and horror. Jangamuttuk, his father and Master of the Ghost Dreaming, is a shaman with ceremonies to send the white ghosts back to their own world. But the ghosts keep coming, settling on the land and destroying the local people. &lt;br /&gt;Initiated into the Dreaming, George learns the secret of transforming into his animal companion, Dingo, and discovers the thrill of the hunt. But he is not alone in his lust for blood. Amelia, the white woman, shares his appetite, feeding on humans and animals alike to maintain her terrible power. Moving into the white settlement, she creates a psychic barrier around it to protect herself and her slaves. The aboriginal people must draw on every resource, both physical and psychic, to overcome this threat to their existence.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;ABOUT MUDROOROO&#39;S MASTER OF THE GHOST DREAMING:&lt;br /&gt;&#39;A real page-turner. The prose is lyrical, yet simple, the images real and ironic... an exciting, moving and engaging novel.&#39; - SOPHIE MASSON, AUSTRALIAN BOOK REVIEW&lt;br /&gt;&#39;A most original contribution to Australian literary style... probably the first instinctively Australian magical-realist novel.&#39; - ROD MORAN, WEST AUSTRALIAN" />
