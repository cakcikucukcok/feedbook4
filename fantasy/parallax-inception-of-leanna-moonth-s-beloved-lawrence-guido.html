  <title>Parallax Inception of Leanna Moonth’S Beloved - Lawrence Guido</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;It is the late 1700s as Leanna Moonth and Deadeye Dick grow up as members of a ragtag gang who love old Sanbal, an eccentric elder who tells them folklore about a dark, mythical creature named Old Throat Eye. But one day after Leanna and Deadeye escort Sanbal and another elder on a trip to Sanbals boyhood home, everything changes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Sanbal relays the story of his earlier travels to a remote mind overlap where he first learned about mysterious turtle stones and a secret society, Deadeye and Leanna are intrigued by the idea that people may have the ability to traverse beyond their universebut only after Throat Eye is defeated. As they mature into adulthood and fall in love, Deadeye and Leanna resist their destiny. But unavoidable reality stalks them. After the lovers elope and team up as extradimensional detectives, they discover Throat Eye is torturing artists and the secret society is growing. A trick leaves Deadeye trapped in a cavern for two decades, and now only time will tell whether he can escape to reunite with Leanna and his gang as battles against the Throat Eye organization intensify into a final confrontation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this fantasy tale, a miracle turns maniacal in an endearing adventure that takes two poetic detectives and their gang on a dangerous journey to stop a plague on human consciousness.&lt;/p&gt;" />
