  <title>The Paths of the Dead - Steven Brust</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The long-awaited sequel to&lt;i&gt; The Phoenix Guards &lt;/i&gt;and &lt;i&gt;Five Hundred Years After&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two hundred years after Adron&#39;s Disaster, in which Dragaera City was accidentally reduced to an ocean of chaos by an experiment in wizardry gone wrong, the Empire isn&#39;t what it used to be. Deprived at a single blow of their Emperor, of the Orb that is the focus of the Empire&#39;s power, of their capital city with its Impe-rial bureaucracy, and of a great many of their late fellow citizens, the surviving Dragaerans have been limping through a long Interregnum, bereft even of the simple magic and sorcery they were accustomed to use in everyday life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now the descendants and successors of the great ad-venturers Khaavren, Pel, Aerich, and Tazendra are growing up in this seemingly diminished world, con-vinced, like their elders, that the age of adventures is over and nothing interesting will ever happen to them. They are, of course, wrong . . . .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For even deprived of magic, Dragaerans fight, plot, and conspire as they breathe, and so do their still-powerful gods. The enemies of the Empire prowl at its edges, in-scrutable doings are up at Dzur Mountain...and, unex-pectedly, a surviving Phoenix Heir, young Zerika, is discovered--setting off a chain of swashbuckling events that will remake the world yet again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the Publisher&#39;s request, this title is being sold without Digital Rights Management Software (DRM) applied.&lt;/p&gt;" />
