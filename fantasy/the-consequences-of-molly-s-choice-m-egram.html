      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Molly Wagner is a radiant blonde and a rumored former party girl. Her charismatic, joyful personality seems to reveal a shallow core, and she may have a couple of rather large skeletons in her closet. In spite of these skeletons, however, she has just been elected President of the United States.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a lengthy, personally painful campaign, Molly has come out victorious the leader of America, having disposed of her competition, chiefly the Republican governor of Ohio in a tense election. Not only did she choose a woman as her running mate, but she chose a Latino woman, Eva Parker. As Molly struggled to move forward after the death of her husband, she drew strength and comfort from her friend, Wall Street financier Jenny Crowley. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now ready for the White House, Mollys difficulties have only begun. The decisions she made during the election will have serious consequences. Beneath the hot microscope of public office, Mollys quirks may not measure up. The press can be cruel, and so can other politicians. Now only time will tell if the most powerful woman in the world will crumble under the pressure, or become the leader America has been waiting for. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This political novel explores age-old questions, such as whether the ends justify the means, whether politics is inherently susceptible to dishonestif not illegalbehavior by otherwise good people, and whether a politicians personal life has a place in public discourse. &lt;/p&gt;" />
