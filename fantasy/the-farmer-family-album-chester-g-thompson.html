  <title>The Farmer Family Album - Chester G. Thompson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The Farmer Family Album is a wedding of fiction and non-fiction that will bring you into the world of the Donkey Dan radio show that spanned four years of Sunday morning broadcasts. The Farmer family is a family of mixed cartoon animals who blend together science, fantasy, family, humor and a bit of religion. Even though the characters are fictional they are taken from our real family, friends, and pets. One of the most loved characters on the radio show was Tremor who appeared in nearly all of our stories.
The Farmer Family album stories are based on some of the actual life moments of our family. 
 The story about the donkey that believed God though mostly fictional has a very biblical ending to it. This can be found in the Old Testament book of Judges Chapter 15, verses 15, 16, and 17. 
 In the Farmer Family album learn how the Donkey Dan show happened. Also check out if Tremor gets caught by Bonkers. Then find out about Gods creatures and how some of them do help us survive." />
