  <title>A Portal to Another Realm - Brandon Palmateer</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Three young friendsJoe, Greg, and Travisbegin an incredible adventure after each finds a separate fragment to an artifact from another realm. Unaware that the fragments have bestowed extraordinary powers upon each of them, the boys get together to examine and discuss their individual artifacts. Once the boys gather their artifacts, though, a being called the God of the Portals emerges from another realm.&lt;p&gt; 
The being tells the boys of their powers and the responsibility they now share; they must use those powers to help free the other realm from the evil that has taken control there.  The boys agree to help and are then transported to the otherworldly City of Spirits. They each discover mystical powers that will help them as they battle monstrous creatures in order to liberate the people of the other realm.&lt;p&gt; 
Now they will be pushed to their limits, desperately hoping that their powers will be enough to realize their plans and save the realm from evil." />
