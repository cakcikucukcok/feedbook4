&lt;br /&gt;
The Boston Girl is a simple and sweet tale of a Jewish girl who grows up in the early years of the 20th century. The narrative is told through the voice of an 85-year-old woman who is recounting the days of her youth to her granddaughter. Addie starts her tale with her family that migrated from Russia, and then the story is told of the gradual progress of her life over the years, during which major events took place around the world. It is a book about family and friendships, feminism and progress, religion and immigration, all seen through the eyes of one person. The Boston Girl is a New York Times Bestseller that made it to number fourteen on the list. It has received positive reviews from a number of different publications.&lt;br /&gt;
