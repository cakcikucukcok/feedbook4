  <title>Adam Reigns - Jonathan Michael Macnab</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In a time of myth, angels and demons wage war for the souls of mankind. When giants and dinosaurs roam the earth and all the world is clothed in perpetual springtime, man lives for hundreds of years, forever growing either in righteousness or in evil. In these days, there are few who remember where they have come from, few who keep hold of the one true God who wrought the world. For those who do, the blinders are ripped off and they see the truth: a world at war. &amp;nbsp;Tucked just behind the veil of sense experience, wars rage and captives are taken as kingdoms collide and man is caught in the middle, a part of the struggle but unaware of his role. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;One such man, Methuselah, the oldest man alive, finds his family caught up in the conflict of the age, the battle for the survival of the human race. In this fight against the forces of darkness and the deep wounds of their own souls, they will face great sacrifice and tragedy if they hope to reach the reward. Some of them will not make the journey, and those who do will never be the same. If they are to succeed they will need hope, which - in ancient earth - is a scarce commodity. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In the pages of this book, much like life, you will find truth amidst fabrication, silver covered in dross. You will find yourself caught up in an epic set in a very real time in human history, populated with real people who lived, loved, and lost. Yet, you will doubt the words even as you read them, because the truth, sometimes, is harder to believe than a lie.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The debut novel from Jonathan Macnab, &amp;quot;Adam&amp;rsquo;s Reign&amp;quot; is a new addition to the great Christian Fantasy tradition of C.S. Lewis, Ted Dekker, Frank Peretti, and Jerry B. Jenkins.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />
