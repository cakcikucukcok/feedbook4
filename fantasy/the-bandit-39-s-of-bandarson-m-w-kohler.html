  <title>The Bandit&#39;s of Bandarson - M.W. Kohler</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Bandits of Bandarson &lt;/em&gt;is the fifth book of &lt;em&gt;The Valley Series&lt;/em&gt;. In previous works, you have learned of the trials that all of rightful magic have been forced to face. In the last book, &lt;em&gt;The Dark War&lt;/em&gt;, you learned of the pains that all must endure, when they fight for what is right. The cost in lives had been high in &lt;em&gt;The Dark War&lt;/em&gt;, and the mourning for those lost, went on for years. The new Overseer of the Realm, Namson, and his wife, Glornina, lead them through these pains, and the feeling of peace, and happiness, had returned to all of the domains.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In this work, &lt;em&gt;The Bandits of Bandarson&lt;/em&gt;, you will learn the truth that evil, in different form, will again find its way into the worlds of magic. The evil of greed, and uncaring, that so many have faced before. The evil of those who would steal what they have not earned, and the dangers they place on others with their avarice. You will find that again, the ones of Rightful Magic, will learn of a threat, and they will face it, not without fear, but with a strength that evil must bow to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here you will learn of the strength of one young woman, named Isabella, who battles her captors with a determination, few can know. That with the help of those who care for what is right, in their own way, win the simplest, yet the greatest of victories. The value of her own worth, and the strength of her love, for Melsikan. Come journey with her, as she faces her trials.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />
