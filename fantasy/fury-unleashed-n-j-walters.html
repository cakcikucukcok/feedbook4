  <title>Fury Unleashed - N.J. Walters</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Maccus Fury, a fallen angel, is trying hard to keep his sanity. Seems being an assassin might be catching up with him. Now, Heaven, or Hell, has sent a beautiful assassin to kill him. &lt;i&gt;Lovely&lt;/i&gt;. She&#39;s pretending to seduce him, and he&#39;s okay with that. She&#39;s smart and snarky--but she has no idea what she&#39;s walked into. And he&#39;s more than peeved that they only sent one person. They&#39;re going to need an army if they want him dead.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Morrigan Quill is one of Hell&#39;s bounty hunters. She sold her soul to keep her sister safe, and now she&#39;s working off her contract by catching bad guys and dragging them back to hell. When Lucifer makes her a new offer--that&#39;s definitely too good to be true--she can&#39;t say no. All she has to do is kill a powerful and crazy-hot fallen angel, who will totally kick her ass in battle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Good thing he won&#39;t see what&#39;s coming next.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each book in the Fury Unleashed series is STANDALONE:&lt;br&gt;* Fury Unleashed&lt;br&gt;* Arctic Bite&lt;/p&gt;" />
