  <title>Storegga Tavern - Victoria Exner</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The realm of Northland, somewhere between the nine ancient worlds and still full of magic, is difficult to reach, but for those who really want to travel so far, there might be a way.
After Ragnarok, there was the rebirth of the next world of Midgard/Earth. In a great slide, Storegga, a piece of the first world, Northland, slid into the space between the nine ancient worlds. Northland is a bridge to all nine worlds of Yggdrasil Circle, and the Northlanders, who possess many odd skills, magic, strange knowledge, and hidden talents, have casual contacts with the old world. 
The ancient law of Northland is its essence. There is also an old contract and oath of nonintervention in Midgard. Not keeping this oath might destroy all there is. However, sometimes it is difficult to keep it.
The time changes, and the circle of the nine ancient worlds will exist only in the dreams and longings. 
Power and knowledge are always dangerous as the Mage of Storegga says when standing on the Storegga Cliff high above the vortex of Maelstrom and looking over the Grey Ocean of Northland. What you want to know now you might not want to know tomorrow." />
