  <title>The Girl from the Shadows - Teri Erickson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Lileon is a beautiful land that bursts forth in vivid, exceptional colors. Tall, vibrant, jewel-like grass dances in a sparkling wind against an azure sky. The people of Lileon live simple, peaceful lives that were made all the more calm when they rejected the technology that once defined them.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;But the Lileons are not alone.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Walking among them are the Shadow People, black-and-white apparitions who move in and out of Lileon. Shimmering windows provide the only glimpses between the worldsand in an instantone of these portals will change everything the people of both worlds believe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like the rest of his people, Cullen Fairchild, the son of Reia Richard Fairchild, the ruler of Lileon, knows nothing of the Shadow People. When he locks eyes with a beautiful woman through one of the ephemeral portals, he is astonished and intrigued.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Katherine Carr, the woman from another world, is equally intrigued by her glimpse of the handsome blond man who keeps appearing and disappearing. He seems familiar somehow. They should never have met, let alone fallen in love, but now nothing will keep the lovers apart. They seemed destined for one another, but when Cullen tells Kat of Lileon, its too much for her to believe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hes from a different world? &lt;i&gt;Literally?&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cullens attention is distracted by the plotting of his uncle Emile, who dreams of making his brother, Richard, pay for past crimes. The waiting over, Emile puts his plan into action.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the end, will Kat believe Cullen? Will Cullen be able to stop Emile from taking over not only Lileon but Kats world as well? Will the invisible boundary between their worlds keep Cullen and Kat togetheror keep them apart?&lt;/p&gt;" />
