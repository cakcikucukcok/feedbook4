  <title>Star Light - Dayna Berthelet</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Book Summary
	Star Light has been reincarnated with two souls; the soul of the mortal, Star Light, and the soul of the Goddess, Moon, also called by Keeper of the Stars. When she remembers who she is, it is just one step towards major change in her world. She can feel it in the air. As she plans to defeat the one that took everything from her she is joined by her old time friend Shadow and her twin brother Styles, who is more than a mortal. They will have old friends and new ones join them in the fight. Will Stars souls be joined into one? Is the change in the air only because of her and her brother or is there more to come?
Autobiography
Right now I live in a lovely little apartment in Chilliwack B.C. with my fifteen month old daughter. Places I have lived are Burns Lake B.C, Prince George B.C, Rainbow Lake Alberta, Edmonton Alberta. Most of my growing up took place in Chilliwack though. In every place I met interesting people and lifelong friends.
I won a Literary Scholarship when I completed school. That was when I knew this was my life path. I had always loved writing and wanted to be a published Author but never thought I was good enough till that day. My daughter and my mother both give me the spirit and the motivation I need. I will always remember to not always dream but to make those dreams come to life." />
