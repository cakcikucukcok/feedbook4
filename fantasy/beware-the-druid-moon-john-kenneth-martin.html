  <title>Beware the Druid Moon - John Kenneth Martin</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;When Jonathan visits his eccentric grandfather for the first time in years, the teen is haunted by nightmares and a foreboding feeling. His curiosity leads him into the attic, where he discovers an unopened trunkand his grandfather suddenly appears with a key. As the lock clicks and the trunk opens to reveal a cross and parchment, Jonathan has no idea that he is about to discover his destiny.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Jonathans grandfather orders him to never touch the cross or the paper to his skin and hide them away, but Jonathan soon learns that he has been chosen by the Bwoaillee who will help and protect him. After Jonathan returns home, more confused than ever, his grandfather passes away. With the goal of finishing high school and becoming a man of God, Jonathan thinks he finally has his life on track. But his innocence is dramatically undone when he is summoned by the God of the Dead himselfSamhain, who wants to retrieve the special artifact in Jonathans possession.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;As a lightening strike propels Jonathan back in time to meet the magical Druid King, he must attempt to return to his real time without succumbing to the temptations of a beautiful goddess. But he is about to discover that only the Druid Moon holds the answers.&lt;/P&gt;" />
