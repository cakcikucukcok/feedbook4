  <title>Dezirah Volume 2 - Jacey K Dew</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;A millennium and a half ago, supernatural beings signed a treaty to disappear. Over time humans let their existence slip away into stories, myths, legends, fairy tale, fable, and movie plot. Upset with their treatment and tired of hiding, supernaturals started a revolution. Some rise up to take control back from the humans; to put them in their proper place in society.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Three souls intersect in their plight to survive the new world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Three weeks have passed since the first attack. The world is in shambles. Chaos reigns as a power struggle begins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alexa watched in horror as her niece was taken by Darius and Sandra. Her feelings are conflicted between her new boyfriend and her ex. Darius still holds her heart, but Daniel cares for her. She is determined to retrieve Rayleen, but at what cost?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Nikki is trapped and tortured. Her only chance to survive long enough to escape is to convince her captors she can see the future. Using her acting skills to convince the demons she has visions might be the easy part.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Jaiden hopes to reunite with her sister. She will use her abilities and the tools at her disposal to assist her travelling group; as long as she can keep them a secret. Resistance greets her at every turn.&lt;br /&gt;
