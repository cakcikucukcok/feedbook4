  <title>Whisper Power - Myron C. Peterson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="After a girl receives several messages from a spaceship, a poem rapidly flows from within her. As she shares the words with a friend, she feels drawn to help the message sender, who seems overwhelmed with negative thoughts. But the young girl is not the only one receiving pessimistic
messagesthe sender is using the press as his instrument with the goal of destroying everyone.&lt;p&gt;
In WHISPERPOWER, Myron Peterson describes an eclectic group of characters as he traces an imaginary trail strewn with stories and poems that each carries an important message about values,
happiness, and the power of positive thinking. As an alien force attempts to use telepathy to gain control, the residents of the Garden of Eden suddenly realize what they have been searching
for all along is right in front of them. In another tale, scientific researcher John Sperus lives a sensible, dull existence where he attempts to constantly cover
his inner struggles. But after he meets a little girl with special powers, everything changes.&lt;p&gt;
WHISPERPOWER is a collection of stories and lyrical verse that will encourage you to think about how you view life, the world around you, and the future." />
