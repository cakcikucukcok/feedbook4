  <title>The Weaver&#39;s Light - Mara Fields</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A Master Weaver with Nothing Left to Lose&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;An Orphan with No One to Care for Her&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;An Enemy So Powerful Its Victims Deny Its Existence&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With the loss of his wife and son, master weaver Callan Vellus has fallen into emotional darkness. Then when his hand is mangled in a tavern brawl, even his art is taken from him. But a dream vision rouses Callan from his stupor, spurning him into traveling north until he reaches the fire-wracked city of his dream. There&amp;nbsp;he finds the destruction is worse than he had imagined. Locals claim that the catastrophe was caused by a freak lightning storm, but Callan knows his vision was something more than an alcohol-induced hallucination, that falcon-faced warriors with blue flame leaping from their bare hands are the cause.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pashi is an orphan living in the ravaged city. With the help of the secrets her mother taught her before disappearing, Pashi not only lives safely in the streets, but survives a direct attack from the falconmages. Yet she finds herself even more isolated from her classmates and community after the attack, as they have no memory of bizarre warriors blasting the city with unnatural fire.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Drawn together by their knowledge of the truth of the bird-faced sorcerers and what they plan to unleash on the realm, Callan and Pashi scramble to find clues about the invaders and how to stop them But the two uncover more than they&amp;rsquo;d bargained for, and the malevolent eyes of the falconmen turn on them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With the fate of their world resting on their shoulders, will the two unlikely heroes find a way to to stop the invasion? Or will the sorcerers&amp;rsquo; blue flames reduce their world to ashes?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A compelling story of courage borne of adversity,&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;The Weaver&amp;rsquo;s Light&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;reminds us that defining and accepting love, loyalty, and family are often ultimately the choices that save us.&lt;/p&gt;" />
