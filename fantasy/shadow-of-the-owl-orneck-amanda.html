Her world is thrown into turmoil however, the night her mother loses her throne, her kingdom, and her life.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Forced to flee the castle, Mylena must live in secret amongst the peasants of a small elven settlement, tending to her wounded father and eeking out a living as an apothecary. As she does, a new sort of life rises from the ashes of her old one, a life that includes the kindling of romance with a young elven boy named Fionn. Mylena falls in love with her new life among the peasants, and prepares to spend her days treating illnesses and hiding who she really is.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Until the day the usurper&amp;rsquo;s minions find her and rip that life to shreds.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Now Mylena&amp;rsquo;s on the run: Running from not only the evil sorcerer who wants her dragged back to the castle in chains, but also from those who want her to step into her mother&amp;rsquo;s position and retake her family&amp;rsquo;s kingdom.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The once pampered princess must choose: Leave behind the simple life she&amp;rsquo;s come to love and rise up to save her people from tyranny, or stay hidden and watch it all burn down around her.&lt;/p&gt;" />
