      <meta name="description" content="Prince Sevrin has grown into a world of wonder. They&#39;re building new hybrid buildings that&#39;ll stand the test of time; shipyards are going strong; and their new aqueduct has found a reassuring beginning. The people prosper under his father&#39;s fair rule. There is room for social change, but on the whole, there is peace and prosperity. 	But his nightmares persist, and a new race of traveller has been seen on their borders, a new race of rider from the South. Or so some believe. And the Kingdoms are threatened with civil war as old monarchs near death with no heirs to continue their line. All moments of peace know an end. More pressing, there is a darkness lurking in the past, an enemy thought destroyed - an enemy forgotten to all but a few. 	As evil rises, heroes must answer the call. 	Or watch their world burn.         The three enchanted blades of legends have been awakened, but who will they select as bearers? And how well will they fare against this new threat?" />
