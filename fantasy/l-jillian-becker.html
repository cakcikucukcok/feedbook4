  <title>L: - Jillian Becker</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Revolution sweeps Louis Zander, a charismatic philosopher of art and politics known as L, into power as dictator of England. This skillfully composed story could be a fictional realization of the Cloward-Piven strategy or Saul Alinsky&#39;s Rules for Radicals. It is a page-turner that traces the process by which one evil man seduces, perverts and destroys an entire nation. L could be Hitler, Stalin, or even the next Prime Minister or President. Jillian Becker was inspired to write this novel while researching her internationally best-selling book, Hitler&#39;s Children: The Story of the Baader-Meinhof Gang.&lt;br&gt;
*&lt;br&gt;
L: A Novel History deserves to take its place among the great dystopias - The Trial, 1984, Atlas Shrugged  alas the most salient literary genre of  the last hundred years.  - Theodore Dalrymple, author of Life at the Bottom; Our Culture, Whats Left Of It; contributing editor City Journal; contributor Wall Street Journal. &lt;br&gt; 
Penetrating as L is as a study of an artist-dictators mind, it is also very witty. There are situations reminiscent of the British TV series Yes Prime Minister combined with the cruelty of Quentin Tarantinos Pulp Fiction. -  Dr. Josef Zaruba-Pfefferman, Institute of Art History, Charles University, Prague&lt;br&gt;
