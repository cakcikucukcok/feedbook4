&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;To make myself understood, it&amp;rsquo;s like I have to speak in an unknown foreign language, every minute, every day,&amp;rdquo; Naoki Higashida explains. He honestly answers questions like: &amp;ldquo;Why do you repeat what others tell you? Why don&amp;rsquo;t you look at people&amp;rsquo;s eyes when you talk to them? Why are you always alone? Why do you talk so loudly? Why do you jump?&amp;rdquo; He says even if they don&amp;rsquo;t appear to remember or learn from mistakes, they actually do, although they could really be slow in the process. Higashida&amp;rsquo;s primary message in this book is for people not to give up on individuals like him.&lt;br /&gt;
The Reason I Jump is a New York Times bestseller and is named one of the best books of the year by The Wall Street Journal, NPR, Bookish, and Bloomberg Business. It was named a finalist for the Books for a Better Life First Book Award.&lt;br /&gt;
???????&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;A Brief Look Inside:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
EVERY GOOD BOOK CONTAINS A WORLD FAR DEEPER&lt;br /&gt;
than the surface of its pages. The characters and their world come alive,&lt;br /&gt;
and the characters and its world still live on.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Conversation Starters&lt;/i&gt; is peppered with questions designed to&lt;br /&gt;
bring us beneath the surface of the page&lt;br /&gt;
and invite us into the world that lives on.&lt;br /&gt;
These questions can be used to..&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Create Hours of Conversation:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;bull; &lt;b&gt;Foster&lt;/b&gt; a deeper understanding of the book&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;bull; &lt;b&gt;Promote&lt;/b&gt; an atmosphere of discussion for groups&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;bull; &lt;b&gt;Assist &lt;/b&gt;in the study of the book, either individually or corporately&lt;br /&gt;
