  <title>The Journey of the Nightisans - Rebecca Linam</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Lucasse Koltz can&#39;t get a date thanks to his embarrassing family. His father, the village mad scientist, disappeared into another dimension after creating his own personal black hole. His blue-haired sister can show visions of things happening in other places. Naturally, no one takes Lucasse seriously either, but he is determined to win fame and fortune after setting out to save the world from its latest trouble, a future dictator.&lt;p&gt; 
It turns out that the world is in no real danger, until Lucasse accidentally releases an ancient curse that sends the moon on a crash course with the planet. The only person capable of resealing the curse is the Guardian of the World, but he has been missing for years! Now Lucasse must embark on a quest to find the missing Guardian, or the world is doomed.&lt;p&gt; 
Between Lucasses arrogance and his ragtag sidekicks, the chances of saving the world look slim. His sister insists on using a badminton racket as a weapon, and the magician Lucasse hires is allergic to magic. To top things off, someone out there wants to stop Lucasse from breaking the curse, and that person turns out to be a shadow from his past." />
