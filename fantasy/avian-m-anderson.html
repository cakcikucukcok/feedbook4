&lt;div id=&quot;00N40000001lfFy_ileinner&quot;&gt;Surviving high school is tough enough without sprouting wings, wouldnt you agree? &lt;br /&gt;Megan Dario is used to blending in without being noticed she likes it that way, for some reasons more particular than others. But when this new boy, this Paul, whoever he is, shows up, her orderly, controlled life is thrown into chaos. No more school, homework, soccer, minimal sociality, wash, rinse and repeat. Oh no. &lt;br /&gt;Before she knows it, Megan discovers shes an Avian. Yup. Not even had her first kiss yet and shes got wings. Say whaaat?! &lt;br /&gt;Lets not forget Dr. Jarvis with his striking appearance and hard eyes either, or Irenesav. &lt;br /&gt;Soon, old and new friends are back in the mix: Lucy, Jason, Cauldron, and Paul, thrown together on one turbulent adventure. Ach, to the say the least, its daunting, and especially so for Megan with her flat, cookie-cutter, routines. &lt;br /&gt;But with some decisions, theres no going back. And with the decisions Megan finds herself facing? Not only will they test her heart theyll test if she can truly fly.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
