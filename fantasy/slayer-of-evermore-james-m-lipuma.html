  <title>Slayer of Evermore - James M. Lipuma</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;Slayer of Evermore is a fast-paced fantasy action adventure filled with battles and intrigue that takes place on the planet Moniva. On this world, there are many races that use magic spells and weapons. Even so, spell-casters have been hunted and killed for nearly a century because of fear and jealousy of their power. As the book opens, a group of adventurers are brought together by Redlina half-human, half-fire-giantto quest for a magic ax known as the Slayer of Evermore. Redlin has ruled over a vast portion of the planet for centuries because of his status as a powerful magician, warrior, and smith able to produce magical weapons of unparalleled strength. Now, his rule is challenged and he has called his allies together for help. Though some of the members of the expedition are well-seasoned fighters and wizards, others are ill-prepared to participate in the adventure. Despite being the most powerful and influential king on Moniva, Redlin needs the Slayer of Evermore to defeat Thrack Morgan, an evil wizard who has been destroying Redlins allies in an attempt to conquer all the human kingdoms on the planet. As the quest begins, two great armies have amassed to do battle. Both sides need to find and claim the Slayer of Evermore in order to ensure final conflict is swayed in their favor.&lt;P&gt;As the quest progresses, the party is shattered by injury, treachery, and happenstance. The ultimate success of the expedition falls to Twig and Aaron, the youngest members of the party as they learn about duty, honor, and leadership. Twig is an apprentice magician who has never been without a teacher while Aaron is a fledgling king who is not ready for the power or the responsibility of his new title. Along the way, they discover love, inner strength, and self-sacrifice. During the quest, these two realize that they must assume responsibility and control of their lives which have been manipulated by others for so long. In the end, the final outcome of the battle is decided by the deeds of these two young adventurers as they face Thrack Morgan.&lt;P&gt;The reader will feel like they are part of the action as they travel along with the party of adventurers through the Forbidden Lands towards the Valley of the Dragons.  The reader will join the party as they undertake an epic quest to defeat beasts and monsters, find lost relics, and save the world from Thrack Morgan and his demons. The stories of all the characters are woven together to create an entertaining and engaging story for the reader to participate in. It is easy to lose yourself in the book and see yourself standing besides the characters as enemies are battled, prizes are won, and the quest is completed.&lt;/P&gt;" />
