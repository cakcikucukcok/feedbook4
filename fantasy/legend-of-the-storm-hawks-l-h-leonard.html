  <title>Legend of the Storm Hawks - L.H. Leonard</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Someday soon, your world will end.&lt;/b&gt; Ending is not as final as it sounds. Our world has ended before. When it does, be patient. Those of your time will linger and watch new cycles unfold. Some will walk this spinning blue rock again. A few will shape its destiny.&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;&lt;b&gt;A sweeping epic&lt;/b&gt;... Readers of Tolkien&amp;#39;s &lt;i&gt;Lord of the Rings&lt;/i&gt; trilogy will find &lt;i&gt;Legend of the Storm Hawks&lt;/i&gt; satisfyingly well-detailed... realistic, involving, and thoroughly riveting.&amp;rdquo; &lt;i&gt;-D.Donovan, Midwest Book Review&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
A master player convinces the pawn the move is its own. Nigel has been at the game longer than most, but lately the pawns keep turning into rogue knights. It&amp;rsquo;s damned inconvenient of them, considering the world is about to end again.&lt;br /&gt;
The Watchers will soon declare this cycle over, as they have so many cycles before, shrugging off yet another rise and fall of humankind, and giving the dragons another turn at dominion.&lt;br /&gt;
When rebellion brings Nigel and his mindgifted charges to the precipice of war, they must choose between hiding their secrets or using their magic, fighting their oppressors or sacrificing freedom for peace.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Legend of the Storm Hawks&lt;/i&gt; is the prelude to the &lt;i&gt;Rootstock Saga&lt;/i&gt;. Set on a future Earth where our own history echoes from the shadows, the tale is filled with political intrigue, inner demons, swords, and magic. Of course, no epic is complete without a few dragons" />
