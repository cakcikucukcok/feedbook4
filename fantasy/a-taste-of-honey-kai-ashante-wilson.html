  	<div class="indent justify" style="visibility:hidden"><b><i>A Taste of Honey - Kai Ashante Wilson</i></b> | ‘A Taste of Honey’ reaffirms my opinion that Wilson is one of the most interesting and talented writers in speculative fiction right now. It is set in the same world (though not in the same time period) as 'The Sorcerer of the Wildeeps', but if ‘Wildeeps’ was a thrilling epic fantasy wrapped around a love story, then ‘A Taste of Honey’ is a thrilling love story wrapped around a core of epic fantasy.<br /><b><i>A TASTE OF HONEY: Wilson, Kai Ashante: 9780765390042 ...</i></b> | Kai Ashante Wilson has the amazing talent of creating a world so rich and so beautiful with little words and pages. From the start, I was hooked. It's not everyday you read about an all black cast in high fantasy. Even rarer are the queer characters but A Taste of Honey has it all.<br /><b><i>A Taste of Honey by Kai Ashante Wilson - Goodreads</i></b> | Aqib is a young man of a diminished family, their last hope to ascend back to relevancy. Lucrio, on the other hand, is a warrior from Daluz, part of a delegation to Olorum. One night they meet and fall in love. A Taste of Honey begins as a carnal love story but soon moves towards social critique.<br /><p><h3 align="left">Download Ebook|PDF|Epub of <a href=>A Taste of Honey - Kai Ashante Wilson</a> </h3></p><hr/>
