At his unbinding ceremony, the powers he receives make it apparent that he is the first Titan to be born in over nine hundred years. In an attempt to get him ready for his destiny, Professor Archer decides to become his personal mentor. But due to a series of incidents, some caused naturally and others deliberately caused by the Ancient Order of the Crones, Cory&#39;s sister Ashley makes the biggest mistake of her young life. Totally unprepared to face the power of the evil Crones, Cory finds himself in the position of being the only one able to save his sister from becoming a Crone for life. Armed with only three months of formal training and the help of his pet bird, Indy, Cory attempts the impossible, knowing full well that if he fails ... the Crones gain far more than a new recruit; they wouldalsocapture the key to the magical community&#39;s only hope for the future, which in turn is the only hope for mankind itself! &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN style=&quot;FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial&quot;&gt;&lt;SPAN style=&quot;mso-spacerun: yes&quot;&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;" />
