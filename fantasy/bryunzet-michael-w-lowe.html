  <title>Bryunzet - Michael W. Lowe</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Emory and Tostan had every right to believe that the defeat of the sorcerer Tolrak had restored peace to their homeland. Yet as they celebrated, the Mishwa Empire and Delta Kingdom were locked in a death struggle in a land far to their west. This ancient conflict had already reached out and touched their lives at the gates of Sea City. All too soon, it would draw them into its fire. &lt;p&gt;
Join Emory and Tostan as they face challenges that will either enhance their skills as wizard and warrior-or strike them dead. Travel with them as they encounter the slave traders of Fortun, stride through the gates of Tarbu Fortress, and descend into the dungeons of Zalgar. &lt;i&gt;Bryunzet&lt;/i&gt; gives you a glimpse of the time that preceded &lt;i&gt;Wizardmont&lt;/i&gt;, introducing you to the mad sorcerer Mellette and Grand Wizard Tarawak, and then propels you into a world where arrows scream, daimen roam the land, the Dark Cloud blocks the sun, and the Promise of the Stones lures one and all." />
