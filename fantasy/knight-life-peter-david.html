  <title>Knight Life - Peter David</title>
      <meta name="description" content="More than 1,500 years after his disappearance into the mists of Avalon, King Arthur has returned. This time, he&#39;s prepared to rule the Camelot of a new millennium: New York City. Handsome, charismatic Arthur Penn is running for mayor on a platform of common sense, humor, and knightly virtues. His advisors include a gifted ten-year-old named Merlin; Percival, an immortal accountant; and Gwen, a lovely young woman with no end of problems. Their grassroots campaign steadily gains strength until scandal looms with the sudden emergence of Morgan Le Fay, Arthur&#39;s sorceress half-sister, and her son Mordred, the aspiring mayor&#39;s ambitious heir. &lt;BR&gt;Acclaimed by &lt;I&gt;Kirkus Reviews&lt;/I&gt; as &quot;steady fun&quot; by &quot;a darkly amusing fantasist,&quot; this imaginative romp is the revised and expanded version of Peter David&#39;s first novel, &lt;I&gt;Sir Apropos of Nothing,&lt;/I&gt; originally published in 1987 and now out of print. David is the author of more than&amp;nbsp;fifty novels, many of which have appeared on &lt;I&gt;The New York Times&lt;/I&gt; bestsellers list. His sparkling update of Arthurian myth abounds in wit, irony, and astute reflections on human nature." />
