  <title>Four Towers - Efim Boone&#39;s Shmakov</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Four Towers is a thrilling tale of good versus evil. It is second and final book from the series called Zondon Alliance and the Order of Inquisition.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As Zondon was attacked over and over by the forces of evil, Attorand came back from retirement, and he disclosed the secret about who is behind the evil, and how to overcome the forces of darkness. Yet these evil forces had prepared the last show of force, and had invaded Zondon in an apocalyptic way. It was like the Armageddon, and only a strike of luck could save Dmitry and his armies. And that luck came through Attorand, who ultimately uses two weapons, so he could save Zondon and its people. The book is also packed with funny situations." />
