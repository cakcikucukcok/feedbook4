  <title>Valour and Vanity - Mary Robinette Kowal</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Acclaimed fantasist Mary Robinette Kowal has enchanted many fans with her beloved novels featuring a Regency setting in which magic--known here as glamour--is real. In &lt;i&gt;Valour and Vanity,&lt;/i&gt; master glamourists Jane and Vincent find themselves in the sort of a magical adventure that might result if Jane Austen wrote &lt;i&gt;Ocean&#39;s Eleven&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After Melody&#39;s wedding, the Ellsworths and Vincents accompany the young couple on their tour of the continent. Jane and Vincent plan to separate from the party and travel to Murano to study with glassblowers there, but their ship is set upon by Barbary corsairs while en route. It is their good fortune that they are not enslaved, but they lose everything to the pirates and arrive in Murano destitute.&lt;br&gt;Jane and Vincent are helped by a kind local they meet en route, but Vincent is determined to become self-reliant and get their money back, and hatches a plan to do so. But when so many things are not what they seem, even the best laid plans conceal a few pitfalls. The ensuing adventure is a combination of the best parts of magical fantasy and heist novels, set against a glorious Regency backdrop.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the Publisher&#39;s request, this title is being sold without Digital Rights Management Software (DRM) applied.&lt;/p&gt;" />
