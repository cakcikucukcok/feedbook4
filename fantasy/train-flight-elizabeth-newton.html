  <title>Train Flight - Elizabeth Newton</title>
      <meta name="description" content="If you travel in time regularly, you will probably have heard of such a thing as a time crash and know that hurtling rapidly through time, is sure to end in confusion, catastrophe or worse... death. I sincerely hope this has never happened to you, but Im telling you about it because this is the situation the Captain and his two passengers, Evie Bamford (Earthling) and Paulo Vistar (Serothian) found themselves in at the close of the last book. I am happy to tell you that the Captain and his crew survive this particular crash. If they didnt, then this book would, for obvious reasons, be considerably shorter.
However, surviving this crash only hurls them into a rollercoaster of other almost equally thrilling events. One of them literally unbelievable, another heart-wrenchingly tragic, another couple extremely arduous, and one that is particularly wet and mucky. This adventure of biblical proportions involves nasty Roman soldiers, facing the renowned King Herod the Great, dodging deadly and uncontrollable plants, escaping the whip of a cold-hearted slave-driver, and solving the mystery of a machine and a coin that are way out of their time. 
All of this occurs because the Train appears to have been stolen and the Captain and his crew find themselves having to entangle themselves further and further into the life and culture of 4 B.C. Jerusalem in order to find it again.
For someone, salvation came in the form of a small steam train modified to be able to fly through space and time. But on that same mild, starry night, for the whole world, it came in the form of a tiny baby." />
