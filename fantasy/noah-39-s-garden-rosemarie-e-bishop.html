  <title>Noah&#39;s Garden - Rosemarie E. Bishop</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;i&gt;Noahs Garden&lt;/i&gt; is a story of lifes most important lessons as seen through the eyes
of a variety of animals and mythical entities, both in nature around us and in our
imaginations. It takes us through the life of one stray dog named Jewell as she
discovers why her crazy antics cause her own troubles to exist, and how that same
energy can be placed on a higher level that would surround her and those she loves
most with much goodness.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
In the process, she runs into the Monster Shadow, the ultimate that exists because
of the discarded bad intentions of all those who have gone through Noahs Forest
before her as they traveled to the garden and to the discovery of their better selves.
With the help of Daffonia, the deer Jewell encounters first when she enters the
forest, and many others, including an aggravating little sprite named Tolebit, all the
way through the many Eyes of the Forest and to their leader, Astilbe, Jewell has the
journey of a lifetime and discovers the true value of learning lifes lessons the hard way.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Noahs Garden&lt;/i&gt; is about sudden realizations and the learning process we all go
through to reach those levels of understanding. It is about self-reflection and
defense mechanisms, fixing our flaws and trying to be as good as we can be. It is
about understanding ourselves and learning to understand the world around us.
