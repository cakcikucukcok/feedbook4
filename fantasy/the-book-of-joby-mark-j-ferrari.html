  <title>The Book of Joby - Mark J. Ferrari</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Book of Joby&lt;/i&gt; is an epic fantasy complete in one volume.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lucifer and the Creator have entered, yet again, into a wager they&#39;ve made many times before, but this time, the existence of creation itself is balanced on the outcome. Born in California during the twilight years of a weary millennium, nine year old Joby Peterson dreams of blazing like a bonfire against the gathering darkness of his times, like a knight of the Round Table. Instead, he is subjected to a life of crippling self-doubt and relentless mediocrity inflicted by an enemy he did nothing to earn and cannot begin to comprehend.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Though imperiled themselves, the angels are forbidden to intervene. Left to struggle with their own loyalties and the question of obedience, they watch Lucifer work virtually unhindered to turn Joby&#39;s heart of gold into ash and stone while God sits by, seemingly unconcerned. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And so when he is grown to manhood, Joby&#39;s once luminous love of life seems altogether lost, and Lucifer&#39;s victory assured. What hope remains lies hidden in the beauty, warmth, and innocence of a forgotten seaside village whose odd inhabitants seem to defy the modern world&#39;s most inflexible assumptions, and in the hearts of Joby&#39;s long lost youthful love and her emotionally wounded son. But the ravenous forces of destruction that follow Joby into this concealed paradise plan to use these same things to bring him and his world to ruin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the final struggle unfolds, one question occupies every mind in heaven and in hell. Which will prove stronger, love or rage?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Book of Joby&lt;/i&gt; is an instant classic of contemporary fantasy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the Publisher&#39;s request, this title is being sold without Digital Rights Management Software (DRM) applied.&lt;/p&gt;" />
