  <title>A Dragon’S Human - Cecilia Lietz</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;You would think that once you got to know another world things would be easier, right? Wrong. Things do not get easier because you know about another world hidden within your own. They actually make things a lot more complicated than necessary. Try planning a wedding for your two best friends, having a ball with it, and then being closed off as the Mystic Realm invades your world, shrouding it in mystery.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;It is bad enough that Connie and Sam get married, but then they refuse to tell me where they are honeymooning. Now I have to go back to Prince Rupert and deal with a whisperer-deprived dragon and my lunatic family who refuses to let me pursue my dancing career. The insanity does not stop there, though. No, there is also a witch, a mage, a long lost father, and two childhood friends who enter the scene.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;My name is Judith Elizabeth Bachor. I am confident, intimidating and I know how to get the information I need. Because I am aware of the Mystic Realm, I am defined as a knower  a dragons human, and youre about to read my story.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Will you let others dictate your worth and limit your options, or will you take control and create your own way in life?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />
