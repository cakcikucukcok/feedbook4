  <title>Arrivals (Born to the Blade Season 1 Episode 1) - Michael Underwood, Marie Brennan, Cassandra Khaw</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This is the 1st episode in the first season of &lt;i&gt;Born to the Blade&lt;/i&gt;, an 11-episode serial from Serial Box. This episode written by Michael R. Underwood. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For centuries the Warders&#39; Circle on the neutral islands of Twaa-Fei has given the countries of the sky a way to avoid war, settling their disputes through formal, magical duels. But the Circle&#39;s ability to maintain peace is fading: the Mertikan Empire is preparing for conquest and the trade nation of Quloo is sinking, stripped of the aerstone that keeps both ships and island a-sky. When upstart Kris Denn tries to win their island a seat in the Warder’s Circle and colonial subject Oda no Michiko discovers that her conquered nation&#39;s past is not what she&#39;s been told, they upset the balance of power. The storm they bring will bind all the peoples of the sky together…or tear them apart." />
