  <title>The Book of Lergat - Sandra McPherson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;A beautiful golden, leather, covered book encrusted with jewels is found by the Moards, working in the mines of the Magenta Mountains and brought to King Gidleron of Dordom. The cover simply says &#39;Scyra Zorkia&#39;. The language in the book is unknown to Gidley (as he is known to his friends) and he tries to find a clue to the books origin by searching his palace library. He cannot find any other book with the same language or any mention of Scyra Zorkia. The harder he searches, the more frustrated he becomes.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;When friends come for a visit, Gidley hopes one of them may know something about the book, but unfortunately, they are as baffled as he is and can&#39;t answer any of his questions.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Trying to find the answers to this intriguing book sends Gidley and his friends on a wild and funny adventure, that is not without danger. The perils they face and the fear of the unknown won&#39;t keep these determined heroes from their quest to solve the puzzle of the books origin.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Little by little, they discover clues to the books secret. What they find at the end of their journey stuns them and solves a long time mystery that will impact all of the Kings and Queens in the Realms of Yonder.&lt;/p&gt;" />
