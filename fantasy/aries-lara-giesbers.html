  <title>Aries - Lara Giesbers</title>
      <meta name="description" content="When the last apostles laid hands to bestow spiritual gifts, the Holy Spirit chose some who would have supernatural strengths to protect mankind from itself until Christ&#39;s return. These were known as those of the Craft.
In the land of Nereheim, Nafaria is the daughter of Lord Jason Mauldon; a vineyard owner and one of the Craft. She was always taught that her knowledge and talents were to be used to help others and was nothing to fear.
However, when persecution breaks out in Denholm Glen, her family flees in the night to another city where they are unknown.
Lord Jason&#39;s wish was to remain anonymous, but his wisdom and willingness to help those around him forces him before the king in an effort to resolve an old legend began with the disappearance of the last Court Adviser to the king.
As Nafaria grows up, she discovers that using her talent for healing and honoring her father&#39;s wish to remain anonymous for her own safety is difficult. To help those around them, the family comes into the public eye. Once again, their fate is tied to a few who bear their secret.
What happens if that chosen few betrays them?" />
