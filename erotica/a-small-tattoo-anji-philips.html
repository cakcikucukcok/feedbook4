      <meta name="description" content="Tracy is a bounty hunter and her instincts are good. Following a lead, she thinks she&amp;#39;s found a woman with a juicy price on her head tending bar, but she has to be sure. The woman&amp;#39;s in disguise and her only identifying mark is a small tattoo of a scorpion in a very private place.

Tracy prides herself on being thorough, and Johnny deserves a good checking out, too.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
~~~~~ Excerpt ~~~~~&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Suzy was already working when I came in on Sunday night. She was dressed more provocatively than she&amp;#39;d been on Saturday, with a short, short skirt and halter top that showed her bare belly. If she&amp;#39;d dressed a little skimpier a little breeze might&amp;#39;ve been enough to let me see the tattoo I was so hungry to see.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
When I sat down I could see Alice in the office trying to make the books look better. Johnny stood behind the bar with Suzy. He smiled at me. &amp;quot;This place is dead,&amp;quot; he said as he poured me a drink.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
It was. I was the only customer. &amp;quot;Well I&amp;#39;m prepared to do my part for the cause,&amp;quot; I told him. &amp;quot;Do I have to drink more?&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
That earned me a smile. &amp;quot;That might help.&amp;quot; Then he disappeared into the back.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Suzy looked over at me and gave me a sexy smile then ran her tongue over her lips, really slowly. It was provocative as hell. As I was the only other person there, I knew she was playing up to me. I wasn&amp;#39;t surprised. After what she&amp;#39;d said, and what Alice told me, I&amp;#39;d figured out what she wanted. She had a thing for me. If I understood right, she liked the idea of banging Johnny, but she was in the mood for a girl-on-girl fun. I needed to figure out the best way to play this. I&amp;#39;d made some contingency plans, set things up just in case, but I didn&amp;#39;t have a clear vision.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Part of my problem was conflicting emotions. Someone, at least one someone, would get hurt before this game finished. I didn&amp;#39;t care if it was Suzy, but I didn&amp;#39;t want Johnny hurt and I didn&amp;#39;t want to get hurt. The large number of variables and uncertainties made the scene a tough one to manage.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I tried to kick my thoughts into high gear. Under normal circumstances I&amp;#39;d brush off the attentions of another woman. Having an attractive person come onto you is a compliment. In this case, I had to consider that letting her seduce me was a simple way to find out for certain about that damn scorpion tattoo. If she came on to me I&amp;#39;d be a fool not to let the game play out. And all I really needed to do was get her naked. I didn&amp;#39;t have to have sex with her. When she stripped, if I saw the tattoo then I could bust her. There was no need to let it go further. If there was no tattoo, she wasn&amp;#39;t Charlotte, and I&amp;#39;d have to play that as it came. I was pretty sure it was her, but I&amp;#39;ve been wrong before and I had to consider the outcome if that was the case.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I&amp;#39;ve done worse and far more stupid things to get a bounty than playing along with someone&amp;#39;s amorous intentions, but this one presented some serious dangers. Romantic dangers. I&amp;#39;ll be honest&amp;hellip;getting Johnny to pay attention to me had become almost as important to me as doing my job. As Alice had noted, getting Suzy out of the way would be a big step forward.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Unfortunately her intention was more complicated than seducing me. She clearly wanted a threesome with Johnny. That blew any chance I had of going to bed with her without him knowing. Even if Johnny was game, even if it didn&amp;#39;t turn Johnny off to me, if Suzy was Charlotte I&amp;#39;d have to arrest her. I couldn&amp;#39;t see how to do that without Johnny thinking that was the only reason we&amp;#39;d had sex." />
