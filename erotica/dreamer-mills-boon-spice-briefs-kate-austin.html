            &lt;em&gt;He had spoiled her for all other men. &lt;/em&gt;
          &lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;It would be a laughable cliché if it weren&#39;t so tragically true. But the mindblowing sex Miri had experienced in her brief encounter with Jack had invaded her dreams and filled her with unquenchable longing.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;And she&#39;d lost her orgasm! Nothing she did could bring it back. Her desperate need had driven her to reckless sexual adventures with dangerous liaisons. But they all seemed unbearably tedious compared to that singular electrifying experience. . . and the tormentingly delicious dreams that allowed her to relive it again and again.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Her friend Heather had once told her to be careful what she wish for—she just might get it. How ironic that her one wish—that her night with Jack would never end—had come true. . . but only in her dreams.&lt;/p&gt;
