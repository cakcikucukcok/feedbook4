&lt;br /&gt;
~~~~~ PG Excerpt ~~~~~&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Book 1:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;You shouldn&amp;#39;t be in here.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Carl shrugged and asked, &amp;quot;Why not?&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Because I&amp;#39;m in the bath,&amp;quot; I said.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;I thought I&amp;#39;d have a bath, too.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
His casual demeanour unsettled me. It was surreal&amp;nbsp; my own son was a stranger to me.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
With that weirdness on me, I said, &amp;quot;But I&amp;#39;m in it, Carl. You can&amp;#39;t have a bath now.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Carl nodded and pulled a face. Then he shrugged and said, &amp;quot;There&amp;#39;s room.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m your mother, Carl. It&amp;#39;s not appropriate. Not at your age. You&amp;#39;re a grown up. You&amp;#39;ve no business being in here with me. I&amp;#39;m naked. People don&amp;#39;t behave this way.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;I&amp;#39;d like to see you naked.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Carl, please,&amp;quot; I gasped, shocked at the boldness.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
He was looking at me like it was entirely normal as he asked, &amp;quot;What?&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
My body&amp;#39;s response was another shock when arousal flared between my legs. I was confused by the situation and what I was feeling while I struggled for the right thing to say.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;You know what,&amp;quot; I said. &amp;quot;That&amp;#39;s just rude. You&amp;#39;re being inappropriate, Carl.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Carl shrugged. &amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m just being honest. Your body&amp;#39;s really nice. I like looking at you.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;God, Carl,&amp;quot; I said, heart starting to thump, &amp;quot;you&amp;#39;ve got to stop. You can&amp;#39;t speak to me like that. What would your father say?&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Book 2:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Tracking my sightline, Annabel glanced down along her frontage. &amp;quot;I keep it smooth,&amp;quot; she said, looking up to my face. &amp;quot;What&amp;#39;s up? Surprised?&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I nodded, staring. &amp;quot;It looks funny,&amp;quot; I said.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Funny?&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Still staring, I said, &amp;quot;Different. I&amp;#39;ve never seen one like that before.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;It&amp;#39;s lovely. Sexy when I go out. It&amp;#39;s exciting to think about what people would say if they knew.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;What does your husband say?&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
With a snicker of amusement, Annabel said, &amp;quot;Oh, he likes it, too.&amp;quot; She thrust her jaw at me. &amp;quot;What about you, Lynette?&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Puzzled, I asked, &amp;quot;What about me?&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Are you a hairy girl? You&amp;#39;ve got dark hair. What&amp;#39;s it like down there?&amp;quot;" />
