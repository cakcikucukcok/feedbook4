  <title>Dirty (Mills &amp; Boon Spice) - Megan Hart</title>

          &lt;strong&gt;
            &lt;em&gt;This is what happened. &lt;/em&gt;
          &lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;I met him at the candy store. He turned around and smiled at me and I was surprised enough to smile back. This was not a children’s candy store, mind you—this was the kind of place you went to buy expensive imported chocolate truffles for your boss’s wife because you felt guilty for having sex with him when you were both at a conference in Milwaukee. Hypothetically speaking, of course.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;I’ve been hit on plenty of times, mostly by men with little finesse who thought what was between their legs made up for what they lacked between their ears. Sometimes I went home with them anyway, just because it felt good to want and be wanted, even if it was mostly fake. The problem with wanting is that it’s like pouring water into a vase full of stones. It fills you up before you know it, leaving no room for anything else.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;I don’t apologize for who I am or what I’ve done in—or out—of bed. I have my job, my house and my life, and for a long time I haven’t wanted anything else. Until Dan. Until now.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;“Dirty may very well become a ‘reread’ to many readers, a ‘keeper’ to others…an intensely emotional story. Unforgettable!” —&lt;em&gt;Erotica Romance Writers&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
