  <title>Taboo Next Door 3 - Houston Cei</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Nancy is a foxy girl and a born leader. Studying is a drag but being at school with her friends is a blast. With her senior year coming to a close, she plans to keep things going. She charms her parents out of the guest cottage to design her own playhouse. She spearheads a clique to meet weekly with parents welcome for companionship and intimacy. It&amp;#39;s &amp;quot;forever eighteen&amp;quot; after graduation.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
~~~~~ PG Excerpt ~~~~~&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Okay, okay. Here&amp;#39;s what&amp;#39;s happening. Even though I don&amp;#39;t like books and studying, I love school. I like seeing my friend and all that stuff but this is my last year and I wanna keep something going with them. We&amp;#39;ll have parties and all be eighteen forever. C&amp;#39;mon, Dad. Can I have the guest cottage?&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Nancy did not have to continue to make her case. She won again, this time using the idea that her parents would never have to see her leave home. Her parents enjoyed their daughter&amp;#39;s enthusiasm and zest for life and at the same time remembered when they were in their teens with similar feelings.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
In addition to the sofa, love seat, king bed, dining table with four chairs and two armchairs that were already in the guest cottage, Nancy requested two futons, a banquet table with folding chairs, a desk and new curtains. The kitchenette was already equipped with a stove and refrigerator but she wanted brand new upgrades and she got them. Nancy wanted the interior design to be breathtaking and so it was with her final touches of dcor.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Wearing her favorite plaid school girl micro skirt, she approached her father to say, &amp;quot;Dad, you have to see my new home now?&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
As she took him by the hand to stroll towards the cottage, he said, &amp;quot;Oh, it&amp;#39;s you home&amp;#39; now. I&amp;#39;m glad you didn&amp;#39;t move far away.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Okay, Dad, it&amp;#39;s fun to joke and I wanna tell you my plans,&amp;quot; she said as she ushered him inside.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Wow!&amp;quot; he exclaimed. &amp;quot;You&amp;#39;ve done a beautiful job on your new place.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Thanks, Dad. C&amp;#39;mon sit down beside me and let&amp;#39;s talk for a while. I wanna have a clique of the coolest girls in town. Everyone will want to get in but only the best make it, sorta like the Green Berets, American&amp;#39;s best. They&amp;#39;ll all be like me and not go to college but this will be like a sobriety and to get in there will be an initiation, but not like hell night. It will be a fun initiation but outrageous.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;It sounds like you&amp;#39;ve put a lot of thought into this.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;You got that right,&amp;quot; she said. &amp;quot;The things we do as initiation will be kept secret and I&amp;#39;m gonna be the first to go and Dad, you&amp;#39;ll be a player.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Me? I don&amp;#39;t understand.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Dad, I know I&amp;#39;ve taken advantage of you in asking for things and I wanna thank you from my heart along with a little payback.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Honey, all that I&amp;#39;ve ever done for you, came from my heart and you owe me nothing.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Okay, Dad, let&amp;#39;s clear the air. I think I&amp;#39;m old enough to give up my virginity now, and that&amp;#39;s going to be my initiation.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Please be careful and selective.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;That&amp;#39;s already been taken care of, Dad. I&amp;#39;ve made my choice.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Hat&amp;#39;s off to the lucky guy.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
As she stood up to face her father, Nancy flashed a bright smile, twirled around and ask, &amp;quot;What do ya think of my little skirt, Dad?&amp;quot;" />
