  <title>Topless Learning - R. Richard</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;b&gt;DESCRIPTION:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Barry and Donna graduate from college, as a very poor married couple. Barry then gets a good job, where he&amp;#39;s assigned to take a customer couple to a topless restaurant for supper. Topless leads to in the nude for Donna and then sex with customers. The whole situation leads to a nudie bar where Donna and the customer lady are made to dance in the nude and more.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;EXCERPT:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Barry, all through school I had to listen to other girls talk about how they had gotten felt up by their dates. At that time, I didn&amp;rsquo;t even have anything to feel! I also wasn&amp;rsquo;t allowed to wear makeup, even if I could have afforded it. And, my clothes looked like Salvation Army thrift shop, which most of them were. My social life and my sex life was nil.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
Donna smiles gently, then continues, &amp;ldquo;When we got to college it was even worse, because I did, by then, have something to feel, but I couldn&amp;#39;t afford to date. I would have liked to buy the kind of clothes that would have shown the boys that I did have something to feel, but you know all about my, then our, financial situation back in college.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Then with a, &amp;lsquo;you naughty boy&amp;rsquo; finger shake, &amp;ldquo;You were the only boy who ever really saw my breasts and the only boy who ever really felt my breasts. And you know what happened? I liked it! I was a girl and some nasty boy was finally feeling me up! Of course, by then I had no choice, not that it was so bad. Now you want me to go out to a fancy supper and you want to know if I&amp;#39;ll be willing to show my breasts in public? Is that what you want to know?&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
(I apologize for the next, rather obvious, lines; they&amp;#39;re for the single guys only.)&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Donna pounces, &amp;ldquo;How much can I spend on clothes for the big event? Who do I talk to about the proper fashions? Can we afford to rent a nice car?&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
We have a few days before the customer supper and we begin to prepare. Donna talks to a lady at my company, who has actually been to the topless restaurant. Donna and then I have a training supper with Donna wearing only a skirt. I play the customer gesturing Donna to her seat while managing to &amp;lsquo;accidentally&amp;rsquo; brush her tit. Donna is a bit flustered at first, but quickly develops a kind of up snoot, &amp;lsquo;watch it buster&amp;rsquo; type of expression. She adapts rather quickly to her status, catching me staring at her tits and, way too sweetly, asking, &amp;ldquo;Oh, did I spill some food on myself?&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I counter by replying, &amp;ldquo;Actually, I was evaluating your tits. On a scale of zero to 10, I would say you rate about a 12!&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
(Actually, I would have to say yes, that our sex life did improve during the topless supper stage. Why do you ask!?)&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The night before the big event, we have a sort of undress rehearsal. Donna has purchased a sort of slip dress outfit (on the company!) Actually it&amp;#39;s a half-slip, rather than an actual dress. It&amp;#39;s a silky, clingy thing with lots of lace. It&amp;#39;s also rather short. The effect is incredibly sexy, I would have called it, &amp;lsquo;Whore on fire,&amp;rsquo; but Donna would have fainted at the phrase, of course.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Donna poses in the little outfit for me, including a little sort of model pirouette. Then she struts in front of me, managing to get just the right jiggle to her tits. &amp;ldquo;Do you like it? It&amp;#39;s a little outrageous and I call the look, &amp;lsquo;Whore on fire!&amp;rsquo;&amp;rdquo;" />
