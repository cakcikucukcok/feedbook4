  <title>The Secret His Mistress Carried (Mills &amp; Boon Modern) - Lynne Graham</title>
      <meta name="description" content="
        &lt;p&gt;Hiding from the Greek…&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;The ink is barely dry on Giorgios Letsos’s divorce papers and there’s only one thing on this unstoppable Greek’s mind: finding Billie Smith, his mistress before his marriage. But the sweet, pliable woman he once knew slams the door in his face!&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Billie has fought hard to heal her broken heart after Gio chose to marry someone else. When he storms back into her life she’s determined not to fall for his seduction again. Especially now that she has a secret to protect… their son.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;But she hasn’t counted on just how badly he wants her back in his bed!&lt;/p&gt;
