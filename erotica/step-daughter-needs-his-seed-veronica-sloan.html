  <title>Step-Daughter Needs His Seed - Veronica Sloan</title>
      <meta name="description" content="DESCRIPTION&lt;br /&gt;
Poor Jane. She wants to have a baby, but her husband is infertile and too stubborn to admit it. She could try artificial insemination, but her kinky mother suggests a cheaper (and much more enjoyable) alternative. Why not get her step-father Bill to breed her? He&amp;#39;s kind and handsome and has the libido of a stallion. Plus, Jane&amp;rsquo;s mother loves to watch!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
EXCERPT&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;It&amp;#39;s okay. Warm me.&amp;quot; Jane molded her body against him and Bill lowered his arms over her shoulders. God, she feels good, he thought. Whether it was her temperature, the moisture, or the sheerness of her bikini, he felt her hard nipples the instant they skated across his side. More tantalizing than that, her breasts were soft and unhindered by a bra. As she sank into him, they rolled against his body.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
His shirt open, her white belly pressed into his. She tucked her hands behind his hips and burrowed her nose into his chest. He tried to keep his legs pointed away so as not to brush her with his erection, but if she felt it she didn&amp;#39;t mention it. &amp;quot;Mm, sorry,&amp;quot; she purred. &amp;quot;I was just so cold.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Hop in the shower,&amp;quot; he said. &amp;quot;Your mom might be back by the time you&amp;#39;re done.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;I can barely move,&amp;quot; said Jane. &amp;quot;And she&amp;#39;s not going to be back for a while.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Did she talk to you?&amp;quot; said Bill. &amp;quot;I don&amp;#39;t understand why she said-&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;She&amp;#39;s not going to be back for a while,&amp;quot; Jane said again. The words were low and husky. She&amp;#39;d spoken into his chest, into his body. He felt her lips move on his shirt.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Oh, um,&amp;quot; said Bill. &amp;quot;Well you shouldn&amp;#39;t stay in those wet clothes.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;They&amp;#39;re hardly clothes,&amp;quot; said Jane. &amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m barely wearing anything at all.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Uh,&amp;quot; said Bill, trying to focus on what she was saying and not the fact that she was absolutely right. &amp;quot;But look, if you get in the shower, I can hunt down some more towels.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;If mom&amp;#39;s not back for hours I don&amp;#39;t just want to be sitting in towels for hours.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Well, honey,&amp;quot; said Bill, exasperated. He couldn&amp;#39;t bear holding her like this. It was torture. &amp;quot;I&amp;#39;ll see if they have some clothes at the gift shop.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m not going to make you go down and buy some stupid souvenir t-shirt and shorts when I&amp;#39;d rather be naked anyway,&amp;quot; said Jane.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Well then maybe you should just do that!&amp;quot; said Bill. He said it without thinking. He just wanted to get her off of him.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Okay,&amp;quot; said Jane quietly. She pulled her chin off his wet chest and looked up at him shyly. &amp;quot;Can you help me?&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Wha, um. Hm?&amp;quot; said Bill.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
She grinned, and raised her arms up to point behind her head. As she did, her nipples dragged along his chest like two sharp fingers. &amp;quot;The knot&amp;#39;s stuck. Can you help me?&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Oh,&amp;quot; said Bill. &amp;quot;Yeah. Of course. What are you going to do, though? Do you want me to use the sheet?&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Just help me,&amp;quot; said Jane. She pivoted against him. Not for the first time did he marvel at the flexible springiness of her body and the fine, swelling curve of her ass. The girl was in excellent shape, and her behind had been honed by many hours at the gym. That it was tucked into the flimsy white bikini (rather, that the bikini was tucked into the crack of her damp buttocks) tortured him with all the firm flesh he could not grab.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
He promised himself he&amp;#39;d be good as he slowly raised his fingers and - as if in a slow, incomprehensible dream - loosened the tight little knot on Jane&amp;#39;s top." />
