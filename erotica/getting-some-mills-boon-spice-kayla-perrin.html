          &lt;strong&gt;
            &lt;em&gt;Lucky Annelise may be having the best sex of her life with her new man, but she can&#39;t help noticing her two closest friends and her sister—fresh from very recent, very public breakups—are miserable.&lt;/em&gt;
          &lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;So she does what any good friend would do: plans a girls&#39; weekend in Vegas! In a town that emphasizes hedonism, Lishelle is sorely tempted. Between sensual masseurs and private exotic dancers, how&#39;s a girl to choose?&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;She finally lets her guard down and beds the perfect guy for a no-strings-attached affair—a sexy rapper looking for a good time with no questions asked. Meanwhile, Claudia is busy getting her groove on with a younger man who makes her laugh. Even better, he&#39;s eager to please and—much to her delight—wants her to be in control in the bedroom.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;It&#39;s Samera who hits the jackpot, though, hooking up with a high roller and finishing off the night in his luxury suite. But Rusty has a dark side, and Samera can&#39;t get home to Atlanta—and away from Rusty&#39;s dangerous friends—fast enough.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;But once the friends return from Sin City, they all receive threatening notes, suggesting someone has been watching them all along. Maybe this time what happened in Vegas won&#39;t stay in Vegas. . .&lt;/p&gt;
