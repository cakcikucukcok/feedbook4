  <title>Corporate Sex Slaves - R. Richard</title>
      <meta name="description" content="DESCRIPTION&lt;br /&gt;
Jim gets a high pay job. Then he finds out that he and his wife have to have sex with customers, or the company goes under. Jill, his wife is willing; maybe too willing. One sex party leads to others. Things descend into sexual chaos and betrayal.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
EXCERPT&lt;br /&gt;
Gary says, &amp;ldquo;There will be a meeting tonight, involving myself and Gina, you and Jill and Ron and his daughter Regina.&amp;nbsp; We&amp;#39;ll meet at my house.&amp;nbsp; The activities will, of necessity, be much like what happened with Billy and Betty.&amp;nbsp; I&amp;rsquo;m not asking anything of you and Jill that I don&amp;rsquo;t ask of myself and Gina.&amp;nbsp; Am I clear?&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I realize that upper management knows what Billy demanded of Jill and me.&amp;nbsp; Now it appears that upper management is going to make the same demands.&amp;nbsp; With a sinking feeling I say, &amp;ldquo;Very clear.&amp;nbsp; However, Billy has me assigned tonight to work the twenty-five hour test for the new Alpha system.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Gary says, &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;ll tell Billy to get someone else.&amp;nbsp; If you and Jill demonstrate a commitment to the company tonight, you&amp;#39;ll have Billy&amp;rsquo;s job tomorrow.&amp;nbsp; Is that clear?&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I&amp;rsquo;m confused.&amp;nbsp; Upper management knows what happened with Billy, Betty, Jill and me.&amp;nbsp; I&amp;rsquo;m not too surprised that they found out.&amp;nbsp; Billy probably bragged about the matter to his secretary.&amp;nbsp; Hell, Billy has been trying for some time to get into his secretary&amp;rsquo;s panties.&amp;nbsp; He would want her to know about what happened with Jill, perhaps to frighten her into also doing what he wants.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Now the company is demanding more of the same thing that Billy wanted, but they&amp;#39;re also telling me that Billy screwed up again and he&amp;rsquo;s gone.&amp;nbsp; I manage to say, &amp;ldquo;Very clear.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Gary then tells me one more thing.&amp;nbsp; He says, &amp;ldquo;What I&amp;rsquo;m asking of you is a company matter.&amp;nbsp; What Billy did was a personal matter.&amp;nbsp; The company doesn&amp;rsquo;t tolerate that sort of handling of personal matters.&amp;nbsp; One way or another, Billy is gone.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
We wrap up the meeting.&amp;nbsp; I walk out of Gary&amp;#39;s office.&amp;nbsp; I&amp;rsquo;m both elated and stunned.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Billy forced Jill and me to swap partners.&amp;nbsp; What he did was wrong and he&amp;rsquo;s now getting what he has coming.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
However, the matter of the SuperScience management wives and daughters is somewhat different.&amp;nbsp; Gina is Gary&amp;rsquo;s trophy wife.&amp;nbsp; She&amp;rsquo;s one hot looking babe and was at least some sort of minor film star.&amp;nbsp; If Gary is willing to hire out his wife, SS is indeed in big trouble.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Even more shocking is the news about Regina.&amp;nbsp; Regina is Ron&amp;rsquo;s only child.&amp;nbsp; She&amp;rsquo;s brilliant and has been in college since she was seventeen-years-old.&amp;nbsp; She&amp;rsquo;s very attractive and also has the kind of young look that only an eighteen-year-old girl can have.&amp;nbsp; If Ron is having Regina screw customers, SS is in really desperate straits.&amp;nbsp; It&amp;#39;s one thing to have your wife screw customers but it&amp;#39;s another thing entirely to have your young daughter screw customers.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I stagger home to find Jill once again waiting for me.&amp;nbsp; She says, &amp;ldquo;I have just finished talking to Gary&amp;rsquo;s wife on the telephone.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Then you have heard the latest news?&amp;rdquo;" />
