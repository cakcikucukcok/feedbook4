  <title>From The Ashes - Damien Sol</title>
      <meta name="description" content="DESCRIPTION:&lt;br /&gt;
Married young to the love of his life. Hard working man while he encourages his wife to pursue her legal career. Spending time together. Enjoying each other, or so he thought. Then one night everything changes on a dime. His life left in shambles as he struggles to pick up the pieces of what he once knew. The fates had more in store for Magnus Condon than he ever thought possible. Something beyond even his wildest dreams.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
EXCERPT:&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;God, yes! I love how my pussy juice feels on your skin&amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo; Sucking in a gasp as Magnus slipped a finger into her hot wet heat. The thump of her head as it struck the door produced a dull ring. Her mouth hung agape as she felt the pad of his finger rubbing along the small rough patch where her G-spot was. A rippling moan burst forth from her lips, her eyes rolled into the back of her head as Magnus brought her to the edge of her orgasm only to have her eyes shoot towards him as he kept her there. Her foot stomped on the floor in her frustration as his eyes held a deviousness to them. She wanted to cum, she needed to cum, she longed to have her cream coating&amp;hellip; Her chest heaved, her nostrils flared, her nipples ached as Magnus lowered himself to his knees. Feeling his nose dragging through her trimmed butterfly shaped bush.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Mmm&amp;hellip; you smell so good,&amp;rdquo; Magnus said, as his nose wiggled as her sex filled his nostrils.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Y-you really think so?&amp;rdquo; Haleema asked, a soft whimper escaped her lips as she felt his breath flow over her labia.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Mmmhmm,&amp;rdquo; Magnus hummed as his tongue flickered out rolling over that throbbing bud.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;F-f-f-fuck,&amp;rdquo; Haleema said, in a trembling moan. Spreading her legs further apart as her nails dragged up the door. Thinking back to what she had read in the article. Feeling her canal clenching in anticipation. Her muscles trembled as Magnus&amp;rsquo;s hand ran along her outer thigh as he lifted her left leg to his shoulder. A garbled groan filled the room as Magnus wasted no time in tasting her eager cunt. A rippling wave of pleasure raced up her canal sending those subtle waves through her womb causing more of her nectar to gather and race down her slick channel. Her fingers weaved through his hair before she took hold of those long silky strands as his tongue parted her lips. &amp;ldquo;Fuck yes!&amp;rdquo; Haleema squealed as his tongue slipped inside her cunt. How her entrance tightened around it as it rolled within her wet mound. &amp;ldquo;Magnus!&amp;rdquo; she howled as her orgasm detonated. Grinding her hips on his tongue as her cream flooded her canal. Her body quaked; her legs shook as the flat of his tongue ran along her vulva. &amp;ldquo;Yes! Yes! Yes! Suck that clit!&amp;rdquo; Haleema growled demonically as his fingers took his tongue&amp;rsquo;s place. Listening to how wet she was as those appendages sped through her quivering hole.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Aah&amp;hellip; mmmmh&amp;hellip; That&amp;rsquo;s it&amp;hellip; Right there! Taste that pussy! Fuck me Magnus!&amp;rdquo; Haleema screamed out as her core reached the red line. Foretelling her ensuing climax, she was in heaven. She didn&amp;rsquo;t think it would feel so&amp;hellip; deific. She couldn&amp;rsquo;t remember when someone paid so much attention to her cunt. Not that she was complaining. She was going to make sure Magnus was repaid in kind. Not because she owed him, but because she wanted to. Even if he wasn&amp;rsquo;t between her legs, that cock of his would still be within her mouth. Her heart raced as Magnus&amp;rsquo;s lips trailed up her stomach as he rose. A look of panic filled her eyes as his arms hooked around her legs lifting her off the floor" />
