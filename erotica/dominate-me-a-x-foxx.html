  <title>Dominate Me - A.X. Foxx</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Hot alpha men dominate the submissives they want wherever they want.&lt;br /&gt;
This sizzling book bundle has alpha males filling submissive women on stages, offices, museums, and more! The submissive young women surrender to the older men without thought, baring it all in public.&lt;br /&gt;
In this anthology, you will find:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Stage Surrender&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
He made it sound so easy. All I had to do to get the role was let go. If I can surrender completely, I can have the leading role in the movie instead of the supporting role I was auditioning for.&lt;br /&gt;
I should have known it wasn&amp;#39;t going to be that easy, not when the man on the stage was the famed sex-god, Zach Davis. As an actress, I have done all sorts of things that I was uncomfortable with, including stripping on stage... but I wasn&amp;#39;t just undressed, I was on my knees, hands behind my back, bound, helpless to do anything but submit.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Passionate Partners&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Everyone tells Freya that it is impossible, that even the perfect candidates are not hired by the company, let alone someone as unimpressive as her. The man in charge, Raphael Hunter, may be wildly successful, but he is also controlling, ill-tempered, and stubborn to a fault.&lt;br /&gt;
Yet Freya Fanning believes she can be successful because she has an advantage nobody else knows about:&lt;br /&gt;
Raphael is a Master. Her Master. And she wasn&amp;#39;t there to work. She was there to be dominated.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Racy Romance&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Handsome, rich, and stubborn beyond words, Liam Hunt has never been denied anything in his entire life. So when he sets his eyes on innocent college student Kate Snow, she doesn&amp;#39;t stand a chance.&lt;br /&gt;
Innocent and helpless, Kate finds herself in the clutches of the most powerful man in town... and loving every second of it. The dominating billionaire breaches her every desire and she is entangled in the brutal strength of his passion. When he brings other men to the relationship, she is helpless to do anything but surrender as they show her pleasure beyond her wildest dreams...&lt;br /&gt;
~~~~~ PG Excerpt ~~~~~&lt;br /&gt;
The first gift arrived at the cafe where I worked in the form of a dozen red roses... and a single diamond pendant necklace in a hidden in an envelope midst the roses. It fell into my open palm with a solidness that worried me.&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Someone&amp;#39;s got a secret admirer,&amp;quot; my coworkers teased playfully, drawing towards me to admire the beautiful red roses that was mildly scented with a sweet perfume. The teasing stopped the moment they saw the necklace. Even to our untrained eyes, it looked expensive. The chain was made of tiny circular silver rings the glimmered in the light.&lt;br /&gt;
Hanging from the end was the diamond pendant that seemed to emit light rather than reflect it.&lt;br /&gt;
There was just awed silence as I held the pendant up to the light. It shone with an unnatural brightness that made my heart tighten and my fingers tremble. It looked real.&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;That&amp;#39;s... fake, right?&amp;quot; someone said, voicing what everybody was thinking.&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;It&amp;#39;s got to be,&amp;quot; I mumbled, letting the girls have a closer look at the necklace while I pulled out the contents of the envelope.&lt;br /&gt;
There was a piece of paper in the envelope and instead of a card or a note, there was a diamond certificate telling me the carat weight (2.5 Ct.), color grade (D), clarity grade (VS1) and cut grade (Excellent). There was even a report number, laser inscription registry, and other various details that I didn&amp;#39;t quite understand. I gulped, wondering where the mysterious gift had come from.&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;It&amp;#39;s real,&amp;quot; Tanya gasped, quickly handing the necklace back to me. It felt surreal.&lt;br /&gt;
I held the diamond between my forefinger and thumb. The slight pinch of the sharp edges of the shimmering gem assured me that I wasn&amp;#39;t dreaming." />
