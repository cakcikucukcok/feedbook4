  <title>Felicia - SJ Lewis</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s long past time for Felicia to return to college, but she&#39;s having too much fun on the beaches of the Mediterranean, where it&#39;s always warm and sunny. She has a lover, an older man who showers her with gifts and attention, and that&#39;s another reason for her to stay. But her lover has a wife, a rich, powerful and ruthless woman. When she finds out about her husband&#39;s latest infidelity, she&#39;s had enough and takes immediate steps to bring her errant spouse to heel. But she has a special kind of punishment in mind for the lovely young girl who led him astray. She has Felicia taken away in the night and put aboard a rusty old tramp steamer. She does not care what happens to the girl after that, so long as she is never seen or heard of again. The captain of the ship is tempted by the lovely young captive, but even more tempted by the money he can get from selling her as a slave to a powerful man that he knows. No one knows what has happened to her, and no one knows where she is. All Felicia can do is try to endure the humiliation, the harsh treatment, the often painful training and the constant sexual abuse if she hopes to survive. At first she thinks that she is the latest addition to her new master&#39;s harem, but she soon learns that she is instead one of a stable of young women whom her owner will share with his friends and business associates. Includes: bondage, slave training, oral &amp;amp; anal sex, punishment, humiliation and so much more!&lt;/p&gt;" />
