      <meta name="description" content="In this fourth entry, Paige and Natalie start to think of themselves as sisters. And sisters always get each other in trouble! Paige reveals Natalie&#39;s indiscretions to her father, leading to well-deserved (and desired) spankings, as well as other forms of &#39;punishment.&#39; Natalie pretends to be angry, but the results of being told on by her “bratty little sister” actually arouses her beyond belief.
~~~~~  Excerpt  ~~~~~
      &quot;And how are things going for you at school?&quot; Jeffry continued, trying to keep the pleasant small talk going as he sat down on the other end of the couch from Natalie.
      &quot;Oh, things get kind of interesting at times,&quot; Paige responded, no longer trying to conceal the wicked grin desperately trying to form.
      &quot;Oh really? How so?&quot; Jeffry asked, curiosity forming on his face as he noticed Paige&#39;s grin.
      &quot;Well, Natalie was doing some serious flirting with our science teacher today,&quot; Paige answered, her voice almost laced with a naughty glee, as if spitefully spilling a closely guarded secret.
      Natalie&#39;s eyes grew wide and her mouth gaped open as she spun her head to glare at Paige. 
      &quot;Natalie, is that true?&quot; Jeffry asked after pausing a second, his demeanor suddenly changing from the friendly conversationalist to the parental disciplinarian.
      Just as Paige had hoped would happen.
      &quot;I was just asking him a question!&quot; Natalie insisted, her voice raised in a defensive tone.
      &quot;Yeah, while leaning over his desk,&quot; Paige retorted. &quot;Your boobs were practically falling out in front of him! He was looking at your tits like a kid in a candy store, and you loved it!&quot;
      Catching on to what Paige was trying to do, Jeffry folded his arms at looked sternly at his daughter. &quot;Natalie...&quot;
      &quot;Daddy, it didn&#39;t happen that way!&quot; Natalie pleaded, surprised that Paige would relay the event so differently from how it actually happened.
      &quot;Come here, Natalie,&quot; Jeffry demanded, pointing to the floor in front of him.
      All of a sudden Natalie&#39;s heart started racing uncontrollably. Looking over at Paige and seeing the evil smile donning her face, the realization suddenly hit her of what was happening.
      Her daddy was about to spank her.
