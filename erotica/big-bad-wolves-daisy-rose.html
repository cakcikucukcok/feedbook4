&lt;br /&gt;
~~~~~ Excerpt ~~~~~&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Miss Kristine?&amp;quot; he asks.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Yes?&amp;quot; she asks, not really looking up. She rubs a hand on the back of her neck uncomfortably before looking up. It appears she&amp;#39;s looking for something, digging into the office supplies cabinet. She huffs and goes on her hands and knees, presenting a completely tantalizing scene for him. He licks his lips and tells himself that he&amp;#39;s not a teenager. He is in control of his body.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;It&amp;#39;s Sunday,&amp;quot; he tells her, frowning at the waif of a thing rummaging through the knives and scissors before pulling back with a particularly sharp pair. She seems to remember he&amp;#39;s there only after she has turned back around and her eyes widen.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
While it&amp;#39;s not his first time seeing her, thanks to her cv, it&amp;#39;s the first time she has seen him in person. And it appears she likes what she sees, her eyes widening and a pink blush coloring her cheeks. She&amp;#39;s wearing a blouse that&amp;#39;s buttoned all the way to her throat. She fiddles uncomfortably with the cuffs under his scrutiny. He tries to soften his gaze.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
She tilts her head like she doesn&amp;#39;t get what he&amp;#39;s trying to say, so he tries again.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;People don&amp;#39;t usually work on Sundays,&amp;quot; he says.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Oh.&amp;quot; Her lips purse and he wants to suck and lick at them until they&amp;#39;re kiss swollen and red.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
He takes a careful inhale and frowns again. She smells off too. Nothing terrible, but just... off.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Should I leave?&amp;quot; she asks carefully, testing the words in her mouth like they&amp;#39;re foreign to her. She&amp;#39;s holding the pair of scissors in front of her like some sort of weapon.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This isn&amp;#39;t going the way he expected. He&amp;#39;s usually very good with charming women. &amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m not telling you to leave,&amp;quot; he blows out a breath.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Her shoulders slump and she relaxes. Her hands are shaking and there are rings of purplish-grey bruises around her wrists, fading tot brown at the edges. It&amp;#39;s even more pronounced because of her pale skin.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
His throat goes dry. &amp;quot;Are you alright?&amp;quot; he asks. There is a confusing array of scents coming from the young woman in front of him. She looks young for her age. Eighteen. Jesus.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m fine,&amp;quot; she says, again in that disinterested tone. She catches the way he is staring at her wrists and joins him, staring at them in confusion, like she can&amp;#39;t quite remember how she got them in the first place. After a moment, she folds her cuffs up higher to hide the bruises.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Making an executive decision, he steps all the way up in front of her and tips her head up, fingers pinching her chin. Her eyes are a lovely brown shade, but that&amp;#39;s not what he&amp;#39;s looking at. Her pupils are dilated and her vision keeps skipping over him. &amp;quot;How many fingers am I holding up?&amp;quot; he asks.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
She leans into his touch and closes her eyes instead of focusing on his fingers.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Where were you before you came here?&amp;quot; he asks, beginning to put together the dots.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Her brows furrow together. It would be endearing if it wasn&amp;#39;t so worrying. &amp;quot;Home, I think?&amp;quot; she whispers. &amp;quot;But I needed to... something,&amp;quot; she whispers. &amp;quot;Oh, I needed to take this off,&amp;quot; she hooks her finger in her collar of her blouse and yanks it down a little. A button springs loose and flies across the room.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
He ignores it. There&amp;#39;s a collar around her throat, confirming his suspicions." />
