&lt;br /&gt;
~~~~~ Excerpt ~~~~~&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Do you want me to kiss you, Rae?&amp;quot; His blunt question perplexed me, bringing my gaze straight up to his. His eyes were so dark, so intense.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Are you asking for permission?&amp;quot; I swallowed.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Yes.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I was curious what it would be like to kiss him on the lips. &amp;quot;Then, no,&amp;quot; I said, hesitantly, wondering if there were repercussions for denying him.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
He did what I was afraid he&amp;#39;d do. With a hand on my arm, he turned me around and faced me, his gaze locked with mine for a longest time as he pressed my hips against the counter with his weight.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;You can&amp;#39;t do this. I refuse,&amp;quot; I pushed at his chest, but he was as steady as a rock, and my palms on his chest only awakened feelings in my loins that made it harder to breathe. I avoided his gaze steadily, looking at anywhere but at him.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;I heard you the first time.&amp;quot; His smirk darkened and my heartbeat picked up at the soft touch of his hand on my chin, tilting my head up to look at him. His thumb was on my jaw, rubbing gently. My knees were suddenly too weak to hold me and as if he knew what he was doing to my body, he wound an arm around my waist to keep me from falling.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;You can&amp;#39;t kiss me...&amp;quot; I said breathlessly, my heart throbbing in my chest as he tilted his head, his exhales turning into my inhales. &amp;quot;I-&amp;quot; he abruptly shushed me with a brush on the lips.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;You&amp;#39;re my prisoner.&amp;quot; His voice was deep, husky, holding a tone that was so heavy it made my lids close. &amp;quot;I can feel desire rolling off you, Rae. Don&amp;#39;t you want this?&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I did. I wanted to feel his lips on mine. In a haze, I moaned and tried to rise on my toes to reach him, not caring that I was his prisoner, that he kidnapped me here. But he pulled away, a self indulgent smirk on his lips.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Stunned, I drew back, my eyebrows furrowed in annoyance. I very nearly growled and tried to reach up to pull his face to mine again, but he only needed to lift his head a little to escape my lips.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Minos, please,&amp;quot; I moaned softly, filled with a harsh and unfamiliar hunger that begged to be satiated. I felt him go deathly still, his breathing hard and deep as everything came to an abrupt halt.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;I never gave you my name.&amp;quot; The terse words were spoken as he took a step back. His expression was hard and tight, his lips set in a firm line. His eyes were dark and troubled and he looked starved as I ran my tongue over my bottom lip.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Minos,&amp;quot; I whispered, trying to calm my pulse. My own breathing was labored, haggard. I wanted him with a desperation that made my throat close up. The tight tension in my core was almost unbearable. He hadn&amp;#39;t given me his name. I didn&amp;#39;t understand why I knew it. It whispered in my soul, a harsh hunger." />
