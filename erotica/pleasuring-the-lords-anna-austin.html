  <title>Pleasuring The Lords - Anna Austin</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Rose is no longer an innocent. Her master has schooled her in the ways of the flesh, and opened her heart to sin and depravity. Now she must serve him and all the other lords, and let them use her as they see fit.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
~~~~~ PG Excerpt ~~~~~&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
His mouth was pulled up in a wry grin, and though I was somewhat frightened by the prospect of an unsavory plan, I suddenly found myself willing to do whatever he asked of me. I was a little ashamed of myself, but I knew that there was no way I could say no to a face as handsome as his.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
My eyelashes fluttered, and he chuckled - I must&amp;#39;ve looked quite silly. After all, I&amp;#39;d gotten this affected by a simple smile. However, I&amp;#39;d like to think that any sensible woman would&amp;#39;ve done the same in my situation.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;What are you planning?&amp;quot; I asked him. He instantly burst into his characteristic laughter, and I couldn&amp;#39;t help but smile along. I could listen to his voice all day, and I wasn&amp;#39;t embarrassed to admit that. It was dark, rich, and sensuous, and my ears simply couldn&amp;#39;t get enough of it. Heart thudding, I held eye contact with him.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Was it that obvious?&amp;quot; He grinned, fingers still in my hair, playing with it. I nodded, pressing myself flush against him and staring deep into those bright eyes of his. Though his true feelings were hard to read, I was starting to pick up on his more subtle cues as time went by - and that twinkle, that smirk - those signified plans." />
