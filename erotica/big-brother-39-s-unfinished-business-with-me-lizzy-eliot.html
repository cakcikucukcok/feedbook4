  <title>Big Brother&#39;s Unfinished Business With Me - Lizzy Eliot</title>
      <meta name="description" content="DESCRIPTION&lt;br /&gt;
Brewster came by my parents&amp;rsquo; house saying that my brother Sal was back in town talking about taking care of unfinished business. I&amp;rsquo;m not sure what that&amp;rsquo;s all about, but I&amp;rsquo;m glad he&amp;rsquo;s back, even if it has Daddy all in an uproar. The way things are going it looks like I might be on Sal&amp;rsquo;s to do list. That&amp;rsquo;s both incredibly nasty and smoking hot&amp;mdash;like Sal.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
EXCERPT&lt;br /&gt;
The guy I brought home from work, a loading dock hunk named Dave, was just a little treat for me&amp;mdash;an afternoon delight to solve my bad case of horny.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
It was Friday morning and we got the word that we&amp;rsquo;d have the afternoon off for some kind of safety inspection. That was perfect. So was Dave. He wasn&amp;rsquo;t the smartest guy at the factory, but he was nicely built&amp;hellip; a big guy with hard muscles that looked like he might give a girl plenty of pleasure. Best of all I knew he was happily married and that meant he wouldn&amp;rsquo;t want more from me than hot sex. I didn&amp;rsquo;t want complications. I just wanted a hot fuck.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
With the afternoon off coming as a surprise that meant no one would be at home at my house and he&amp;rsquo;d have free time his wife wouldn&amp;rsquo;t know about. With that in mind, as soon as I had an excuse to go out to the loading dock, I got close to him, like close enough to rub myself against his crotch, and made an indecent proposal. &amp;ldquo;How about coming home with me this afternoon for a hot fuck?&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;I shouldn&amp;rsquo;t,&amp;rdquo; he said, looking stressed.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Because you are married.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
He nodded. No one was around, so I ran my hand over his crotch. &amp;ldquo;Something tells me you want to though. And its so much more exciting to do the things you shouldn&amp;rsquo;t do.&amp;rdquo; I had him sweating and shaking, so I backed off and gave my lips a slow lick. &amp;ldquo;Come over and I promise that we will do a lot of things we shouldn&amp;rsquo;t do&amp;mdash;that&amp;rsquo;s my specialty, Dave. I&amp;rsquo;ll make you explode and then, if you can get it up again later, maybe we can have a great time repeating all our mistakes.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I&amp;rsquo;m good at making my point, and sure enough that afternoon we were naked in my bedroom. He was tanned and when I wrapped my fingers around his swelling prick I was rather pleased. He was nicely equipped. A promising stud.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
As I knelt down and licked the lovely big head of his cock, listening to his soft moan of pleasure, I knew I had told Dave the truth. He wasn&amp;rsquo;t bad, but he wasn&amp;rsquo;t all that special. What was special was that fucking a married guy was wrong. Bringing him into my parents&amp;rsquo; house and sucking his cock, doing all sorts of nasty with him, was something I shouldn&amp;rsquo;t do. That made it hot and exciting.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
As I took him in my mouth and sucked him, Dave trembled. His hands were on my head, playing with my hair. The way he was responding I figured the odds were his old lady didn&amp;rsquo;t blow him at all. She was probably a nice girl, his wifie, and a nice girl shouldn&amp;rsquo;t suck a guy&amp;rsquo;s dick. Some bitches don&amp;rsquo;t want to do it at all, and nice girls don&amp;rsquo;t suck cock on the first date. Fortunately I&amp;rsquo;m not nice. That gives me advantages over a lot of girls. It&amp;rsquo;s just a fact. When you are naked with a guy, nice is not the quality he&amp;rsquo;s looking for." />
