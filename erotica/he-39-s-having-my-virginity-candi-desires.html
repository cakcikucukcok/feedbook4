  <title>He&#39;s Having My Virginity - Candi Desires</title>
      <meta name="description" content="WILL HE REALLY BE HER FIRST?&lt;br /&gt;
When Eric is around Alejandra, he finds it hard to concentrate. He&amp;#39;s an experienced older man and he wants to be with Alejandra. And as a younger woman, Alejandra knows she&amp;#39;s got to do it for the first time with someone. And she wants it to be him!&lt;br /&gt;
You know you want it!&lt;br /&gt;
~~~~~ Excerpt ~~~~~&lt;br /&gt;
For some reason, Eric feels really awake.&lt;br /&gt;
He&amp;#39;s sitting on the couch at the end of a long day, watching a movie with his friend&amp;#39;s 18-year old daughter Alejandra. He doesn&amp;#39;t know why he feels so energized, but he does.&lt;br /&gt;
Alejandra&amp;#39;s been paying attention to the movie, but to be honest she&amp;#39;s not very impressed by it. She feels like she knows what&amp;#39;s going to happen already, even before it&amp;#39;s happened. She breathes a deep sigh and lets it out.&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Mm,&amp;quot; Alejandra squirms around on the couch. She gets up and Eric pauses the movie as she does.&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;What&amp;#39;s up?&amp;quot; he asks.&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m uncomfortable,&amp;quot; she says, rearranging the cushions. Eric gets up too and gives her a hand, and when it&amp;#39;s all ready they straighten up.&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;There,&amp;quot; he says to her. &amp;quot;That better?&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
Alejandra looks up into her buddy&amp;#39;s eyes, and for some reason he sees something there that wasn&amp;#39;t there before.&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;I guess we&amp;#39;ll just have to find out now, won&amp;#39;t we?&amp;quot; she asks, giving him a sultry smile.&lt;br /&gt;
Eric looks down at his friend&amp;#39;s daughter and Alejandra looks back up at him. She feels thick waves of horniness flowing through her, not stopping, making her desire him so hard it&amp;#39;s a challenge not to just reach down, grabbing onto his tool and rubbing it right here and now.&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Hey Eric,&amp;quot; Alejandra says to her buddy. &amp;quot;I want to tell you something.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;What&amp;#39;s that, honey?&amp;quot; Eric says.&lt;br /&gt;
Alejandra takes a breath and lets it out.&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;I want to have a baby,&amp;quot; she says, and Eric blinks down at his friend&amp;#39;s daughter. &amp;quot;I&amp;#39;ve been thinking about it for a long time and I want to have a baby.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Wow,&amp;quot; Eric says. &amp;quot;That&amp;#39;s quite a decision.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;I know,&amp;quot; Alejandra says, looking up at him. &amp;quot;And now all I need is for someone to be the father.&amp;quot;" />
