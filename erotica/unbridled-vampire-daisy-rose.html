  <title>Unbridled Vampire - Daisy Rose</title>
      <meta name="description" content="When Raelynn and her werewolf protector seek refuge on a cruise ship, lust is heavy in the air, consuming them with a breathless urgency that drives the werewolf to take her for the first time.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
But they are not alone. Raelynn is drawn into a maelstrom of an affair between a possessive werewolf and a seductive vampire who offers her protection... in exchange for her body.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
~~~~~ Excerpt ~~~~~&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;What if I refuse?&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Reaching out, his fingers toyed with the collar of my dress. &amp;quot;I suppose we would just have to hold you down,&amp;quot; he suggested dangerously, his fingers gripping the collar of my dress, eyes gazing at me so invitingly. I couldn&amp;#39;t help but feel something in me relax as he continued to look at me.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Shades of pink poured into my cheeks and without thought, my gaze dropped from his eyes to his lips.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I shook my head. &amp;quot;Stop it.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Stop what?&amp;quot; he started, pulling me closer to him. My body arched into his, our bodies fitting together like parts of a puzzle.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Whatever you&amp;#39;re doing. Stop it,&amp;quot; I pulled away, deliberately trying to focus my eyes at anywhere but him.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
His chuckle vibrated through his body to mine, sending a chill down my spine. &amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m not doing anything,&amp;quot; he said and with one tilt of his head, closed the space between us. He tasted like mint and blood. I didn&amp;#39;t mind. His lips were soft, full, and cold.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I thought I heard a growl behind me, but the touch of his tongue on my lips erased all trace of Kenzo from my mind.. His tongue ran along the seam of my lips and I parted them, allowing him inside. His kiss was passionate and hot, burning me from the inside out. His hands were on my shoulders, tight enough to keep me in place, but not so tight that I couldn&amp;#39;t pull away if I wanted to.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Trembling, I struggled to find reason through the haze of the moment. Yet, as his tongue continued to dance with mine, my thoughts were jumbled together, making little sense.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Something like panic started to build in my chest, but only for a moment, a stray murmur in a roaring of pleasure of his lip on mine. I could feel him, every inch of him, every breath he took, everything he felt. Something wound tight, strong, and sharp, coursing through my veins and stabbing in the depths of my heart. He consumed me, taking control.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
What was it that I was feeling? My blood seemed to roar, pounding, echoing in my chest as things clicked into place. The very air around us grew dense, shrouding us in darkness despite the lights.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Had I been holding onto my hate for him because it was easier? That couldn&amp;#39;t be right. It was so much easier to love this strange vampire in front of me.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Too soon, he pulled his mouth away from mine, trailing hot, open-mouthed kisses down my chin and to my neck. His long fingers unzipped the dress from behind and he pulled one sleeve off my shoulder, his mouth trailing after it. His tongue licked above the dip in my neck.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Gasping, I scrunched my eyes shut and clutched at the fabric covering his chest, pushing against the intensity of him as his touch skimmed down my bare shoulder, tugging the dress all the way down my hand. The feel of his warm breath wafting over my collar bone propelled the heat to every part of my body, tearing a whimper from my lips.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Stop this,&amp;quot; I gasped, but my fingers gripping his shirt tightly, pulling him closer.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
From under his lashes, his eyes leveled themselves upon me, boring into my soul as he drew his lips back and sunk his teeth into my neck, creating punctures in the soft skin. A hot, torrid shock was sent straight to my loins as I arched my back and released a needy moan, echoing down the hall.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I felt Kenzo&amp;#39;s hands around my waist, keeping me on my feet as Diego drank from my veins." />
