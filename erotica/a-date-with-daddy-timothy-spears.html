&amp;ldquo;I still don&amp;rsquo;t understand why you set this up, Caroline.&amp;rdquo; Tom Forrester looked through his closet, trying to pick out something to wear for his evening out. With his daughter. Christ. What was his wife thinking? He sighed heavily. &amp;ldquo;I mean, it&amp;rsquo;s not like I&amp;rsquo;ve got anything in common with her, you know.

&amp;ldquo;I still don&amp;rsquo;t understand why you set this up, Caroline.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Tom Forrester looked through his closet, trying to pick out something to wear for his evening out. With his daughter. Christ. What was his wife thinking? He sighed heavily.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;I mean, it&amp;rsquo;s not like I&amp;rsquo;ve got anything in common with her, you know. I don&amp;rsquo;t understand half of the things she says in any given conversation. Face Book? IM?&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Caroline Forrester watched her husband from the back. She knew perfectly well why she had set up the father-daughter time, but it wouldn&amp;rsquo;t do to let Tom know about that yet. All in due time. He was really a strikingly handsome man, her husband. And what was even better, he was somehow unaware of it. The best combination.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
At thirty-eight, his physique was in outstanding shape. His bare shoulders were broad, the muscles of his back well-defined. He had a full head of light brown hair. There was no evidence of any balding there. And his ass&amp;hellip;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;That&amp;rsquo;s exactly the point, isn&amp;rsquo;t it, Tom? You&amp;rsquo;ve let your relationship with your only daughter slide. And if you don&amp;rsquo;t try, you won&amp;rsquo;t have a chance to build it back up again. No, not that shirt.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Tom looked at the shirt he had selected, and rolled his eyes. God, you&amp;rsquo;d think she was sending him on a date, for crying out loud. He found another shirt and held it up for Caroline&amp;rsquo;s approval. She nodded, and he started to pull it on.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
His wife was still a beautiful woman, he thought, as he got dressed. She was fifteen years older than him, but had maintained her figure well. He recalled how he had met her, nineteen years before. She was fresh out of an early marriage, with a son, Donnie, who had been only four at the time. She had been stunning, her long copper hair in curvy waves down her slim body.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
He had been catering an event, his first solo affair. It was an upscale thing, with many of the most powerful people in the town present. Caroline was there too, the new divorcee, a figure-hugging black dress showing off all her assets. And a sparkly diamond necklace that swooped into the valley between her lush breasts.&lt;br /&gt;
