  <title>Taboo In Paradise - Houston Cei</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Susan has grown into a shapely girl who is yearning for the touch of her father who cannot help but notice the beautiful grown woman is taunting him into a forbidden lust. Mom understands Susan is randy, she was a flirt in school herself as she wrestled with her own physical changes. A sexual disclosure along with Mom&amp;#39;s witchery paves the way for a magical weekend for dad and daughter.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
~~~~~ PG Excerpt ~~~~~&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;I had been admiring myself in the mirror in just my underwear. I wanted Dad to see me, and as soon as he entered the family room I exposed myself to him. It was all my doing. There I was almost naked right in front of him, and he even apologized for seeing me as if it were his fault. He took off and I felt terrible but I wanted him anyway, in a way a daughter is not supposed to want her father. So was I out of character or am I a slut?&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Emily quickly responded, &amp;ldquo;The answer to the last part of that question is &amp;lsquo;absolutely not!&amp;rsquo;&amp;nbsp; Of course, I see why you are feeling so guilty but it&amp;#39;s certainly understandable.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;But,&amp;rdquo; asserted Susan, &amp;ldquo;and this is a big one:&amp;nbsp; when Dad and I held each other for those few seconds, it wasn&amp;rsquo;t like a father and daughter embrace. I felt a tingling all over my body...No man has ever made me feel like that. I wanted him to do it to me right then and there.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Now, Susan,&amp;rdquo; Emily said. &amp;ldquo;I wasn&amp;rsquo;t trying to shock you with all my disclosures but just want to point out that I am no one to be judgmental after all the things I have done. You&amp;rsquo;ve made an attempt to seduce your father and although I&amp;rsquo;m not totally okay with it, I am not angry with you. In fact, and don&amp;rsquo;t you repeat this to anybody, I&amp;rsquo;m a little intrigued by this.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Oh, Mom!&amp;rdquo; she exclaimed in shock with her eyes wide open, &amp;ldquo;Are you saying you approve of my making advances towards Dad?&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;&amp;#39;Approve&amp;#39; is not exactly the word I would use and I certainly don&amp;rsquo;t want to sound caviler because this is a serious situation. I accept it for now but you do not have my blessing and it&amp;rsquo;s something that has to come to an end&amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Susan interrupted, &amp;ldquo;Mom, before you go any further, I want you to know that I have no intention of trying to steal your husband away from you or damage your marriage in any way or disrupt this family. Even if I wanted to I could never compete with your beauty.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Hold on again,&amp;rdquo; Emily cautioned. &amp;ldquo;First of all, you don&amp;rsquo;t have to sell yourself short. You are not second to me in looks; any man would be honored to show off an attractive woman as yourself. You&amp;rsquo;re tall and like I said, you walk stately like a queen... you have every bit as much sex appeal as I may have. Secondly, Robert is a good man and being quite a handsome one, it is understandable why you would feel this way.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;With your looks, it is unrealistic to think that Robert has never once fantasized having sex with you. There have even been times when I caught him gazing at your cute butt a little longer than necessary, and many times he said to the effect that &amp;lsquo;she&amp;rsquo;s going to make some lucky guy very happy.&amp;rsquo; This may only be a crush that just happened to be in tune with a passion you were feeling at the time, but in any case, I feel confident that we can work through it.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;I think that you and Robert need to get away together soon, this weekend in fact. Somewhere exciting where you are very unlikely to see anyone we know. I would suggest a nice hotel in Honolulu. See the sights and do all the fun things, and&amp;hellip;well...when and if the time is right and the mood is right&amp;hellip;whatever happens, happens.&amp;rdquo;" />
