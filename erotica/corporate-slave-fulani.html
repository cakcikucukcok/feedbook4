Shes a sales assistant in a convenience store, in a society where sex is used to sell everything and is one of the main commodities for sale. When she buys one of the new Intelligent Dresses to wear when shes out clubbing, it sparks a sequence of events that lead to her being accused of using the garments on-board computer to carry out industrial espionage.

She is imprisoned, interrogated and tortured, and ultimately sold as a slave to a senior corporate exec, Mistress NightMaire. She becomes a pleasure slave to be used for the entertainment of guests and clients. Meanwhile she discovers a friend of hers, Lorne, is also being held by Mistress NightMaire. And Lorne, it turns out, does have connections to dissident groups. Cassie begins to plan her escape. But will she be able to find Lorne? Will she be able to join up with the dissidents? Can they change the world? And just as importantly, now she knows the capabilities of the Dress can she get her hands on another one?" />
