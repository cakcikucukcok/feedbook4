      <meta name="description" content="Brooke isn&amp;#39;t an ordinary futanari...while most futas are drawn to women, she finds men incredibly sexy! But none of the men she&amp;#39;s known have wanted her back...until she meets Dale, a sexy football quarterback who&amp;#39;s secretly bi-curious. When they make a deal to satisfy each others&amp;#39; lusty erotic cravings, they both get way more than they ever expected! Not your ordinary boy-meets-girl&amp;nbsp;love story!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
~~~~~ PG Excerpt ~~~~~&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Even as she panted with rising pleasure, Brooke glared down at the source of all her woes. It was nearly seven inches long, thick as the circle between her thumb and index finger, and crowned with a shapely purplish head that was incredibly sensitive. It rose proudly from the tight wiry curls at her groin, and curved enticingly toward her flat stomach.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
How she wished it would curl the other way, so she could...&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
But that would make her even more of a freak, she thought with a frustrated sigh. Didn&amp;#39;t she already have enough trouble?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Her pediatrician had assured her parents that it would wither away on its own through lack of use. It hadn&amp;#39;t, though. It had grown big and strong right along with the rest of her body, and had been her worst enemy until that magical day she&amp;#39;d discovered she could stroke it and feel...incredible!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
She didn&amp;#39;t mind so much living like a hermit and working from home when it meant she could walk around naked and masturbate whenever she wanted. And she wanted to a lot, because futas had abnormally strong sex drives.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
But lately she&amp;#39;d become more aware of her isolation.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
According to the rumors, most of the Others, as she thought of them, because she hated thinking of herself as a futanari...it sounded so different, and she was deathly tired of being different...seemed attracted to women. Her strong attraction to men was just one more indication that she was a freak.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
A freak among freaks. Way to go, Brooke! What&amp;#39;ll you do for an encore?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
But she couldn&amp;#39;t deny that a cute guy with a buff body always turned her on both ways. She always got soaking wet and rock-hard. Both parts throbbed with aching need until she stripped down and masturbated again...and again. And sometimes even that wasn&amp;#39;t enough to quench the fire.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
That&amp;#39;s why she&amp;#39;d tried dating Troy, and they&amp;#39;d had a good time for the first few weeks. She&amp;#39;d let him kiss her and stroke her breasts, and it had felt so amazing!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
But then he&amp;#39;d snuck past her guard, and pressed his hand between her legs...and he&amp;#39;d felt her big shaft straining against her wet panties.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
He&amp;#39;d freaked, and backpedaled off the couch so fast he&amp;#39;d nearly fallen. And those vicious, hateful things he&amp;#39;d said to her...remembering them was almost enough to make her go limp.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Almost.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Her small hand pumped energetically up and down, and renewed pleasure whipped through her quivering body. Yeah, she knew how to masturbate like a pro. But it wasn&amp;#39;t enough. It could never be enough!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
She needed...more.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
She needed...a man.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Did she dare? What if she chose wrong again, and it all blew up in her face...again?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
If she ever did risk it, though, she knew who she&amp;#39;d want it to be.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Dale Harper was the quintessential boy next door; his apartment was right next to hers. And he was drop-dead gorgeous. His shoulders were wide, his chest and arms were muscular, and he had a smile that made her feel weak all over. Nothing made her climax faster than imagining him bending over her...&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Was he big? She didn&amp;#39;t know for sure, but she thought maybe he was. She&amp;#39;d caught just a quick glimpse before he&amp;#39;d turned away the other day, down at their long row of mail slots. She was sure there had been a sizable bulge in his jeans!" />
