  <title>About That Night... (Mills &amp; Boon Blaze) - Jeanie London</title>
      <meta name="description" content="
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;The plan is simple.&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Julienne Blake will use self-hypnosis until she&#39;s discovered the sexy woman inside, then she&#39;ll seduce Nick Fairfax during an unforgettable night. And with a tantalizing performance for an audience of one, she does just that. But her sensual plan seems to have worked just a little too well, because Nick is begging for a return engagement.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Nick has never met a woman who could capture his attention so completely as Julienne has. Her risque moves have him pursuing her all over sultry Savannah just to be alone with her. But he&#39;s not a long-term kind of guy, so his desire to extend this passionate affair has him completely baffled. Somehow he has to convince her there&#39;s more than that night between them….&lt;/p&gt;
