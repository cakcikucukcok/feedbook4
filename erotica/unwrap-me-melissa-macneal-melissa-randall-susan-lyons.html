  <title>Unwrap Me - Melissa MacNeal, Melissa Randall, Susan Lyons</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Tis the season for all things sexy and there&#39;s no better way to celebrate than with these three naughty novellas. These three girls don&#39;t want coal in their stockings. They&#39;re looking for something big and hard that will last the whole night long.  .  .  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  &lt;b&gt;  Naughty Noelle   Melissa MacNeal&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;    Being nice has gotten Noelle nowhere so this Christmas she decides to give naughty a try. And there&#39;s no one better to practice on than bronzed and blonde Andy Hathaway, who&#39;s got a package she can&#39;t wait to check out.  .  .  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;    Unwrap Me   Susan Lyons&lt;/b&gt;    When Jude Benedetto opens the door and finds her very own studly Secret Santa, she&#39;s ready to celebrate the season with some steamy sex. Counting down the twelve days of Christmas has never been so exciting-- or erotic.  .  .  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;    All She Craves For Christmas   Melissa Randall&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  Renovating her childhood home in time for the holidays seems impossible until Anita hires Dylan Scott.  His body is hot enough to melt snow and he quickly shows her just how talented he is with his tools--and his hands.  .  .       &lt;b&gt;Melissa Randall&lt;/b&gt; is a pseudonym for a successful literary agent. She is the author of &lt;i&gt;Sexually Satisfied,&lt;/i&gt; an erotic romance published by Aphrodisia. A former New Yorker, she now lives on Cape Cod." />
