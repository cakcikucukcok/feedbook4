  <title>Nobody Does It Better (Mills &amp; Boon Spice) - Julie Kenner</title>
      <meta name="description" content="
        &lt;p&gt;For author Paris Sommers, truth has become stranger than fiction. She&#39;s fallen in love with a man who exists only in her mind–a man she &quot;invented&quot; as a pseudonym for the fast-paced, testosterone-laden spy novels she writes. Only, now the man of her dreams is standing beside her, touching her, loving her. But who is he?&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Bar owner Devin O&#39;Malley wanted Paris the first moment he saw her. And he was willing to do just about anything to get her–including &quot;becoming&quot; novelist Montgomery Alexander. Only, his deception worked too well. Before long, he&#39;d stolen his way into Paris&#39;s bed &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; into her heart. But was she in love with Devin–or the fantasy he portrayed?&lt;/p&gt;
