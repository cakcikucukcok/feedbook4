  <title>The Lisa Series -  Charles Arnold</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Charles Arnold, author of The Sweet Wife 1 &amp; 2, and The Penitent Series, now presents us with Lisa, Her Initiation &amp; Lisa, Her Education in one massive volume. Lisa, Her Initiation - Former detective, Frank, has been watching the sweet, innocent Lisa for months, scheming to take control of her. Plans in place, he shows Lisa and her husband, Billy, a tape that has damning evidence of her teenage son in a drug deal. In exchange for the tape, Frank proposes that Lisa submit to him completely for 30 days. She can only agree - finding herself flung into Frank&#39;s raunchy world... exhibited in a rowdy bar, paired with men she abhors and begrudgingly placed into sex acts she despises but cannot resist. Husband Billy is made to hear about every detail, sometimes required to observe, but he&#39;s powerless to help her. Lisa, Her Education - The intimidated young wife has had her world turned asunder by a raunchy sexual initiation at the hands of the devious Frank. When she agrees to remain with Frank, her cuckolded husband, Billy, is shocked. Though he tries to wrench her from the surly man&#39;s tight grasp, Lisa isn&#39;t about to budge - especially when she&#39;s finding a crude, but inescapable satisfaction in the vulgar acts Frank demands of her. Even when the sex gets &#39;too dirty, too cruel, too gross&#39;... Frank has his ways of winning Lisa&#39;s submission, as he makes her put into words the things that excite her so much. Her debasement continues, and before long, Lisa realizes her essential nature as a submissive slut. As Lisa&#39;s sexual education continues, she&#39;s faced with every more obscene choices... choices that would end her marriage and send her off to foreigners whose only goal is to opress her." />
