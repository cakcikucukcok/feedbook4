  <title>Daddy Collects Rent - Abigail Lucie</title>
      <meta name="description" content="DESCRIPTION:&lt;br /&gt;
Daddy needs to collect his rent money. His nineteen-year-old daughter and tenant Bianca needs to learn some responsibility about paying her rent on time. Daddy confronts her with a worthy proposition until such time he can collect every last cent. Bianca has no choice but to accept&amp;ndash;over and over again.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
EXCERPT:&lt;br /&gt;
Bianca paused. Daddy assumed well that Bianca figured out that Daddy&amp;rsquo;s wife was most likely going to accuse her of throwing her dad under the bus, if not being a depraved brat for actually propositioning her father to make up the rent and he refused.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Hey, it&amp;rsquo;s the way of the world,&amp;rdquo; Daddy chimed in. &amp;ldquo;You may not like the way it works, but it&amp;rsquo;s the way it is. And deep down you know it, too, little girl. I haven&amp;rsquo;t graced this fine earth for forty-five years without pulling a few tricks out my sleeve. Look, I&amp;rsquo;m not asking you to do anything you wouldn&amp;rsquo;t want to do as two consenting adults, but how I figure, you can either bum it for the next couple of days waiting for the marshals to serve your or you can ease your pretty little mind for the next couple of weeks and come as many times as you&amp;rsquo;d like.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Don&amp;rsquo;t patronize me. I may be late on my rent, but I&amp;rsquo;m not a prostitute for my dad.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Least you didn&amp;rsquo;t say you weren&amp;rsquo;t a slut,&amp;rdquo; Daddy improperly said aloud.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Fuck you!&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;My bad,&amp;rdquo; Daddy apologized. &amp;ldquo;Look, it is all prostitution to a man in one form or another. Let&amp;rsquo;s be honest about that.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Bianca pursed her lips, riled by the nerve of her father.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Take dating for example. Dating consists of a man taking a woman out hoping that she&amp;rsquo;ll give him some somewhere down the line. Marriage consists of a husband taking care of his wife to get the same result. For that, I have to go to work and collect rent in a timely manner to make sure I still get laid and even that isn&amp;rsquo;t always a given.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;So you want me to give myself to you in exchange for rent?&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Never that, little girl,&amp;rdquo; Daddy laughed. &amp;ldquo;Consider it more or less a favor for not paying rent thus far. You may not be a fan of my methods, but you&amp;rsquo;re got to admit that I&amp;rsquo;m kind of sexy when I&amp;rsquo;m not being an asshole.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Bianca eyeballed the length of her father&amp;rsquo;s tall frame, pondering it over for a minute.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;m not a fan of hairy men.&amp;rdquo; Bianca conceded.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;That&amp;rsquo;s because you&amp;rsquo;ve been playing in the sandbox with little boys too long to know what hair on a real man means.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;What does it mean?&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;It can mean a variety of things. The most important of them all is that he is a man who knows how to really take care of a woman, that he knows how to keep a roof over her head. That he knows how to make her toes curl and her pussy squirt back at him like she&amp;rsquo;s mad at the world.&amp;rdquo;" />
