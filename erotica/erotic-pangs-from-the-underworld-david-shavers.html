  <title>Erotic Pangs From the Underworld - David Shavers</title>
      <meta name="description" content="DESCRIPTION:&lt;br /&gt;
The top nun in the country is assigned to perform the job that no one else will take - an exorcism. Unfortunately for her, she is very sexy and every being that sees her is overtaken with lust. How much can she handle?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
EXCERPT:&lt;br /&gt;
Most of the parishioners glanced down the road in anxiety. Their hearts were thumping loudly against their breastplates. Their faces were creased with pure horror as they anticipated the coming of their deliverer, like the redeemed lot, vigilant for the Second Coming.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
She was indeed running late. They knew. Yet, they had no choice but to eagerly await her arrival. Even if she didn&amp;rsquo;t turn up till the following day.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
She was the only exorcist in the whole district. If not the only for the half of the whole country that was generous and considerate enough to heed their call.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Their only prayer was that he remained strapped to his shackles lest they do not have an unwanted pandemonium on their hands. They jumped as they heard the very shrill voice of the possessed human torment them from within the confines of the building. His voice reverberated through the building, sending chills through them and shaking the whole edifice to its very foundations. Their hairs stood on edge and their feet quivered where they stood.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The sun was almost out of the view, having tirelessly completed its sojourn around the earth one more time, as usual, when they saw a pair of headlights shatter the thickness of the unnerving darkness.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
A few of them sighed with relief. Their savior had arrived." />
