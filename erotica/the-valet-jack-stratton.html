  <title>The Valet - Jack Stratton</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The Valet is the tale of a dedicated butler doing his best to attend to the needs of his employer&amp;#39;s female guest.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
From The Valet:&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
She looked over the uneaten fruit and pastries and sighed.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;A man like that certainly does leave a lot of leftovers,&amp;quot; she said, a little sadly, pouring herself some more champagne and considered her place.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;No need to worry, miss, nothing will go to waste,&amp;quot; I said pouring the orange juice into a plastic jug for later. She laughed at this, her charm was visceral.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;He doesn&amp;#39;t mind you taking the leftovers?&amp;quot; she asked, the question lingering in the air whether she meant the food or other things.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;I assure you, he often insists, miss&amp;quot; I said, gathering her glass and her coffee cup, not close enough to touch, but close enough to feel the heat of her body.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Does he ever let you finish what he&amp;#39;s started?&amp;quot; she said, her voice lower. I straightened.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;You&amp;#39;ll have to ask Mr Leinhardt about that, miss, I&amp;#39;m not really at liberty to talk about the goings on of the house,&amp;quot; and there was nothing in my voice. I squashed all feeling and simply busied myself with the cleaning up of breakfast and memorizing every blushing inch of her body.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;What if he told you to-&amp;quot; she reached down and grabbed my crotch. I coughed a bit, mostly for her benefit. It&amp;#39;s unfair to have such a ravishing woman think she has no effect on a man. Even a man who is adept at swallowing his own desires.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m afraid, as I said, you&amp;#39;ll have to take that up with Mr Leinhardt, miss. The particulars of my responsibilities are indeed up to him. And if I might, miss, my name is Howards.&amp;quot;" />
