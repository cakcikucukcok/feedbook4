  <title>Her Sinful Punishment - Anna Austin</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Mary has always been a good girl. But hunger has made her desperate. Caught stealing, she must face justice.&lt;br /&gt;
But the town constable has an intriguing proposition. She can go to court and stand trial&amp;mdash;or she can take his more personal punishment. His brand of discipline involves pain and humiliation&amp;mdash;but also intense pleasure and delights of the most sinful kind&amp;hellip;&lt;br /&gt;
~~~~~ PG Excerpt ~~~~~&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;I did not want to believe it when Mrs. Jones told me, you know. I thought she had got it wrong. After all, Mary Bennett is a sweet girl, a polite young lady from a good family; she was not raised to be a thief.&amp;rdquo; Mr. Miller spoke at a slow, even pace. Mary dug her fingernails into her palms and bit her lip. She was dangerously close to crying.&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;I know that the death of your parents has been hard for you. I understand that these must be hard times for you, but I cannot even begin to put into words how disappointed I am in you. I expected so much more from you, Mary.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
Mary trembled on her seat. She tucked her chin against her chest, trying to make herself as small as possible. Whatever she had imagined Mr. Miller&amp;rsquo;s disappointment would look and sound like earlier, the reality was a hundred times worse.&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;You should know by now that it is impossible to commit a crime without being caught in a small town such as this. You have disappointed me with your actions and your thoughtlessness.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
Mary bit back a sob; she had never felt this bad, she would give anything to make it stop, to get away from Mr. Miller&amp;rsquo;s harsh words.&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Now, your punishment. I should send you to court where you will be charged according to the law and your punishment will be decided by the judge. However, I am willing to give you another option.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
Mary straightened a bit in surprise. She hadn&amp;rsquo;t even thought about going to court and the prospect seemed daunting. The judge might send her to jail and Mary knew that she wouldn&amp;rsquo;t last a day. She was certain that whatever Mr. Miller had in mind was infinitely better than going to court.&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;You need to be disciplined for your actions. You need a firm hand.&amp;rdquo; Mr. Miller paused and for the first time, Mary dared to look up. She still did not look Mr. Miller in the eye, but she let her gaze fall on his chest in anticipation." />
