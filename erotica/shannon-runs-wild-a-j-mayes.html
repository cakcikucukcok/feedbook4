  <title>Shannon Runs Wild - A.J. Mayes</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;b&gt;DESCRIPTION:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Shannon is a 43-year-old single mom and finally free of her of her deadbeat ex, she&amp;#39;s ready to move on with her life. Her son, Cam, is in Texas and leaving everything behind, Shannon moves to Austin to be close to him. The last two years of the marriage were rocky and missing raw, hard sex, she&amp;#39;s desperate. One night, Shannon asks Cam to stay with her at the hotel, and unable to control her desires, she seduces him and her story begins.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;EXCERPT:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Her mind screaming, &amp;#39;Don&amp;rsquo;t do this&amp;#39;, Shannon saw Cam sitting on the sofa with a blanket draped over his lap and eyeing his bare, ripped chest, moved closer. &amp;ldquo;Find everything you need, honey?&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Yep. All set. Did you have to wear heels, mom?&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Yeah. Wearin&amp;rsquo; heels ... makes me feel sexy. Don&amp;rsquo;t you like &amp;lsquo;em?&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Sure I do.&amp;rdquo; Cam squirmed and afraid his mom could see the shape of his cock, adjusted the blanket. Your legs look fantastic. Enjoy the shower?&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;It was okay, but all it did was make me hot.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;It&amp;rsquo;s summer in Texas, mom. Hot is what you get.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;That&amp;rsquo;s not the kind of hot I&amp;rsquo;m talking about. Honey, I gotta find me a man &amp;hellip; and soon.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Know how you feel. I&amp;rsquo;m thinkin&amp;rsquo; I shoulda called one of my ex-girlfriends for a booty call tonight. It&amp;rsquo;s been awhile.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Poor baby. Maybe you can take care of it after I go to bed.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;I might have to.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Leaning over, Shannon brushed her lips over Cam&amp;rsquo;s, lingering longer than she should. Flushed when she stepped back, a breast popped out of the robe, and letting Cam see it a moment before pulling the fabric over it, Shannon said, &amp;ldquo;Sleep well, honey. Cam, let me know if you need anything &amp;hellip; anything at all.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;I will. Love you, mom.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Love you too, baby boy.&amp;rdquo; Shannon smiled and turning from Cam, slowly walked to the bedroom door. Looking over her shoulder, she said, &amp;ldquo;Remember, I&amp;#39;m here if you need me &amp;hellip; I&amp;rsquo;ll leave the door open.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Thanks &amp;hellip; I&amp;rsquo;ll let you know if I need something.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;I hope you do.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Walking towards the floor-to-ceiling windows forming the suite&amp;rsquo;s outer wall, Shannon moved to a corner, and pushing a button, watched the heavy drapes glide open. Her mind still screaming, No, Shannon stood in front of the middle window, and knowing Cam was watching, looked out at the city lights shimmering far below. Silencing her mind&amp;rsquo;s protests, Shannon took a deep breath, and untying the sash, let the robe slide from her shoulders. She placed her fingers on the window, and spreading her legs, pushed her ass back, her silhouette bathed in soft, silver rays coming through the glass.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Her temperature soaring, Shannon felt wetness seeping from her slit, and took another deep breath, waiting for her son to take the gift she was offering. Feeling his enormous erection brush her round cheeks and warm breath on her neck as he kissed it, Shannon sighed, &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;m so sorry, son. I couldn&amp;rsquo;t stop myself.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;It&amp;rsquo;s okay, mom. I&amp;rsquo;ve dreamed of making love to you for years.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;You don&amp;rsquo;t hate me for seducing you?&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Hell no. I love you even more.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Turning his mom, Cam&amp;rsquo;s mouth covered hers, and during the deep kiss, Shannon&amp;rsquo;s legs turned to jelly, her knees buckling. Cam scooped her in his arms, and covering the few steps to the king bed, set her down gently. Shannon licked her lips and spread her legs. &amp;ldquo;It&amp;rsquo;s been so long, I need a man in me &amp;hellip; just fuck me, baby. Fuck me hard.&amp;rdquo;" />
