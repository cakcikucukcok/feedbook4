~~~~~ PG Excerpt ~~~~~&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;You&amp;#39;d better try to get some sleep.&amp;quot; Adam&amp;#39;s voice was uneven, and his chest hurt. So did his surging shaft. But he&amp;#39;d promised to protect her, and he wouldeven from himself.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;What about you?&amp;quot; She patted the edge of the bed. &amp;quot;There&amp;#39;s room for both of usand we&amp;#39;re both gonna freeze if we don&amp;#39;t.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
He was pumping off enough heat to melt an igloo!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;I don&amp;#39;t think that&amp;#39;s a very good idea.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;You don&amp;#39;t want to be near me.&amp;quot; The hurt look on her face undid all his fierce resolutions. Brenna blinked back tears, and miserably hunched over again. &amp;quot;Why did you drag me all the way out here if you hate me so much?&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;I don&amp;#39;t Jesus, Brenna, I don&amp;#39;t hate you!&amp;quot; He gaped at her in surprise. &amp;quot;I just don&amp;#39;t think it&amp;#39;s safe to sleep in the same bed with you!&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Sudden anger sparkled in her eyes. &amp;quot;Well, why not? Mom doesn&amp;#39;t care, otherwise she would have stayed. And it&amp;#39;s the only way we&amp;#39;re going to stay warm all night!&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
How could he explain it without hurting her feelings?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Brenna, you&amp;#39;re my&amp;quot; The word stuck in his throat.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Your what? Problem? Burden?&amp;quot; She glared bitterly at him.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;No. And you&amp;#39;re not ugly, either, and you know it, so don&amp;#39;t try that tact with me. It hasn&amp;#39;t worked since you were six days old!&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Well, I&amp;#39;m not six days old.&amp;quot; She sounded sulky now. &amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m eighteen. And I thought you loved me.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Oh, baby.&amp;quot; He wanted to pull his hair out. &amp;quot;I do love you, more than anything else in the world! Why do you think I brought you along? But you are only eighteen, and I&amp;#39;m thirty-seven, and&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;And what?&amp;quot; She scowled at him through the silky curtain of her hair.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;And it&amp;#39;s not proper for me to sleep in the same bed with my eighteen-year old stepdaughter.&amp;quot; There, he&amp;#39;d spit the hated word out.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;So you&amp;#39;d rather freeze to death. Fine.&amp;quot; Brenna thumped down on the mattress, and turned away from him. &amp;quot;Whatever!&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The teenager&amp;#39;s ultimate insult. Adam nearly laughed.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
But damn, she looked so incredibly sexy, even snuggled up in his two shirts and a blanket! Because all he could think about was unwrapping her, one enticing layer at a time, to find the sweet tempting treasure buried deep inside!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Was she still a virgin?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
She hadn&amp;#39;t dated anyone inoh, it had to be months. So maybe, maybe!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
God, how he&amp;#39;d love to be the first one to spread her legs and bang her senseless!" />
