  <title>No Apologies - Lizbeth Dusseau</title>
      <meta name="description" content="I trust that whatever deeds this gentle spirit of my soul leads me to, the divine is there, and peace is present, and the dry, arid wastelands of my life have become blooming gardens of sensuous joy. Naked Revelations This book was a labor of love, a curse, a blessing and an obsession. I consider it my sexual anthem. Writing it put my discoveries and my sexual philosophy into a concrete form, allowing me to clearly see the results of my efforts. It offers my readers a refreshing and valuable look at this most misunderstood aspect of human nature. This website has been on the Internet for over four years, and in that time I&#39;ve received many e-mails from those who are exploring their own sexuality, their desires, their fantasies and their sexual choices. With each e-mail, I realized that my personal experience had a good deal say to those, like me, who may be scared, traumatized or even turned frigid by the mention of sex. For much of my life that was me. My fantasies were a mystery to haunt, condemn and cause me great guilt. They were as dark and extreme as the novels I write. I tried to eradicate them from my mind. But for all my determination to do so, they never disappeared. And my attempts to control the blooming and vibrant sexuality of my youth turned my body cold and unresponsive. To awaken this dormant side of me and make peace with it required that I do an about face and look my sexual fears squarely in the eye. Taking up the challenge, I followed a clear path laid before me to reopen my physical body and rekindled my desire. After more than thirty years of repression, I discovered that it is possible to have a healthy and exciting sex life. Not only did this breathe new life into me and my marriage, it awakened my creative muse as well. For those that have sexual fears, who blanche at intimacy, or are haunted by fantasies, or traumatic sexual events, No Apologies offers the means to finding your sexual realness. It shows ways to open and enhance intimate relationships, and resolve the guilt and self-judgment that can accompany our sexual experiences. This book explores taboo desires, sexual obsessions, and the nature of dominance and submission, as well as the relationship between sex and creativity. It talks of the various ways people experience their sexuality?how we are not all the same. Most of all, it shows how to find acceptance and enjoyment in a world that is commonly judgmental to the wild variety of sexual desires and choices. No Apologies is about how we can take control of our sexuality, acknowledge it, and experience it, so we can enjoy what this elemental aspect of our human nature can bring to our lives in personal satisfaction and intimacy with those we love." />
