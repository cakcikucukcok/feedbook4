  <title>Wives Who Have Affairs Book I - Chris Dawson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The first story is about how a loving, faithful, and monogamous wife who is seduced by her Boss and came to want more of the same experience.  Her one source of anxiety was what to tell her husband about this affair, which she knew she had to divulge. It turned out she need not have worried as her husband was accepting and not only did his love not falter but he was as turned on as she was. What happens after is the continuing story. The second story is about about a very happily and monogamously married woman who just could not help herself and who found extramarital pleasure while still in love with her husband. She took a part-time job cleaning a condo and ended up getting quite a surprise the first time. What happened when she got fucked each and every time she came to the condo to clean was that she came to want it. One can only imagine the feelings when she finds out her lover is her husbands boss and this all comes out and the husbands reaction to his wifes newfound sexuality." />
