  <title>Bad Work Etiquette - Daisy Rose</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Selena is a naive Shifter who has spent her entire life in a special home for shifters like her. Her only link to the outside world is a Werewolf. Erik is a successful man almost twice her age and they&amp;#39;ve never met in person, but she can&amp;#39;t wait to meet him when she&amp;#39;s free. Except a series of bad decisions sends her straight into the arms of a man who makes her submit to perverse, terrible things.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
~~~~~ Excerpt ~~~~~&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Wiktor?&amp;quot; she prompts when he continues to hold her against him.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;You do smell very lovely, darling,&amp;quot; he says. &amp;quot;Perhaps I would have a taste of you first.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
That is all the warning she gets before his hands are on her hips and he&amp;#39;s lifting her up and kissing her hard, tongue pushing into her mouth past her lips.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Pleasure courses down her spine. &amp;quot;Sir, please,&amp;quot; she whimpers, pushing back against him, trying to free herself. From the corner of her eyes, she sees the other girls giving her looks as they walk past, but none of them move to interrupt them. There&amp;#39;s a wet patch growing on her chest, milk leaking out.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Lovely,&amp;quot; he says, licking his lips as he leans back. There is desire in his eyes, so intense that she looks away. &amp;quot;I knew I chose you for a reason.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
He chose her because she&amp;#39;s the most ignorant one to fall for his tricks. Not that there were many to choose from in the first place. There were only three hucows turning eighteen this year and her friends had been suspicious.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;That, and the fact that you are the best dancer of the year,&amp;quot; he says.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
She can&amp;#39;t help but preen at the compliment. She&amp;#39;s not very smart, but she&amp;#39;s good on her feet. &amp;quot;Thank you,&amp;quot; she says, blushing prettily.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
He lowers her to the ground. &amp;quot;Good girl,&amp;quot; he says. &amp;quot;Now, give me a kiss.&amp;quot; He does not wait for her to respond, pulling her chin forward forcibly until his lips are on hers, fingers clenching hard on her jaw to pry her lips open so he can taste into her mouth. His tongue seems to be everywhere at once, sliding over her teeth and around her tongue, licking the roof of her mouth and the inside of her cheeks. She resists the urge to bite him.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
She learned the repercussions of fighting back against the man in charge of her the first day after he took her out. Her rear still hurts from when he had thrown her over his legs and spanked her. It had been a humiliating experience in the car. Her cheeks burn just thinking of it. He hadn&amp;#39;t even bothered closing the divider between the driver seat and them. The driver had gotten an eyeful and she had blushed terribly." />
