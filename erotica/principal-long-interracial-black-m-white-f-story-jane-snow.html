  <title>Principal Long (Interracial Black M / White F Story) - Jane Snow</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Loni is a mother of two with a husband who likes to try to put her down with his words. The two also haven&#39;t been intimate since she was pregnant with their second son. When her oldest son, Jake, gets into a fight with the school&#39;s quarterback, she agrees to visit Principal Long if Jake does the chores for a month.
When she talks with Principal Long, he informs her of the repercussions of her son&#39;s actions and the fact that the quarterback was black. The quarterback&#39;s parents want to press charges, not just for their son being hit but also pressing that it was a racially motivated action. He lets Loni know that he&#39;s very close with the quarterback&#39;s parents and can easily convince them to stop... in exchange for something Loni can do for him.
Loni soons find that the Principal&#39;s last name is more than just a name but a perfect description for his manhood. Does she go through with the deal to help her son?
