  <title>Boss&#39;s Naughty Daughter - Kethandra Wilde</title>
      <meta name="description" content="In no mood for Halloween fun, the holiday still brings an unlikely couple together, aided by sunburn, a very naughty kitty costume, a regretted promise and a fat joint of weed. That starts an intimate exploration of both desires and fears and a romance that will last for years.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
~~~~~ PG Excerpt ~~~~~&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The thin sounds of music were louder, seeming to come from below. Rob looked down over the balcony, into the bare, grassless fenced yard.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
He pulled his head back immediately, stunned. Heart beating rapidly, he took a breath before risking a second quick glimpse.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
A single chaise lounge was below him. The music came from a single little speaker on the small table beside the lounge. The table also held a glass with the orangish ice left over from a vodka screwdriver, a disposable lighter and what Rob thought must be the small roach left after smoking a joint of the weed he had sniffed in the kitchen.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
What had stunned him was what, or who, was on the lounge. It had to be Sara. The red-blond hair, and lush young body in a bikini, bathing in a patch of mountain sun, brought back memories of the Martins&amp;#39; daughter three years ago, in a form-fitting dress at his brother Brian&amp;#39;s wedding. It recalled the warm extended hug she had given Rob - &amp;#39;My favorite swim coach!&amp;#39; - accompanied by a bright, genuinely delighted smile.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Fortunately, now, her eyes were squeezed shut. The tension on her lovely face, the rigid arch to her torso, were explained by the two hands shoved down inside her bikini bottoms.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Bare, extended arms squeezed together and displayed twin halves of a full, rounded chest. Rob thought he saw a slight shudder to the soft flesh.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
He pulled back from the balcony and snuck inside, short of breath and suddenly aware of the stiffened response in his cargo shorts. His mind raced with images, thoughts, urges.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
He needed something to focus on. An anchor. Something. Anything. His mind kept returning to the slight, perhaps imagined, jiggles of those mounds, barely held by the twin triangles of a bikini, pushed high and together by two straining arms.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
He grinned, his breath and heart slowing. He had been right: unlike her slim mother, Sara would definitely be beyond appropriate community standards going outside without a bra like her mother used to. He was right again: it was silly, and petty, but it gave him the anchor he needed.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Control regained, he wondered at the strength of his reaction. He had been single for too long. IT as a profession and as an education had not brought him in contact with too many lovely ladies recently. Being reserved in nature, Rob hadn&amp;#39;t found the big city of Boston fertile ground. Back in Chico, with many of his peers married now, Rob worried about never finding the &amp;#39;right&amp;#39; one." />
