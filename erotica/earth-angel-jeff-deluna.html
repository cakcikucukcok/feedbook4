  <title>Earth Angel - Jeff DeLuna</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;b&gt;DESCRIPTION:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Rosalie married her husband, discovering a demon. Truly demonic, the sadistic passions Frank forces Rosalie to endure with her daughter leave them reluctantly begging for more. Determined to save his high school sweetheart, Ray Franklin soon finds himself caught in a world of demonic torture, forced sex, and sexual depravity. Can Ray save Rosalie from the demonic passions holding her captive?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;EXCERPT:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
My discussion with Kathy went better than I had expected. I waited until a couple of days after her birthday bash to bring up the subject. &amp;ldquo;There&amp;rsquo;s something I&amp;rsquo;ve been meaning to discuss with you, Honey,&amp;rdquo; I started out.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Yes?&amp;rdquo; she asked. &amp;ldquo;What is it?&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;How do you think we&amp;rsquo;ve been getting along these last few months?&amp;rdquo; I asked.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Pretty well, I guess,&amp;rdquo; she said. &amp;ldquo;But things aren&amp;rsquo;t as good as they once were between us. I&amp;rsquo;m sure you know that,&amp;rdquo; she offered.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Yes, I know that,&amp;rdquo; I said. &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;m glad you found Linda and that you&amp;rsquo;re more satisfied sexually than you were before,&amp;rdquo; I started. &amp;ldquo;But somehow that makes our love life seem less than perfect&amp;mdash;less than satisfactory. Wouldn&amp;rsquo;t you say?&amp;rdquo; I asked.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
She thought about it a while and responded, &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;d say our love life is very satisfactory. But it&amp;rsquo;s not complete, if that&amp;rsquo;s what you mean. I need Linda to complete me sexually. If it weren&amp;rsquo;t for her, I&amp;rsquo;m not sure we&amp;rsquo;d still be together.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Exactly,&amp;rdquo; I remarked. &amp;ldquo;That&amp;rsquo;s exactly true. And I don&amp;rsquo;t want to be a &amp;lsquo;partial&amp;rsquo; husband or a &amp;lsquo;partial&amp;rsquo; sex partner. And what you orchestrated the other night showed me a lot about what you really think of me.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;I don&amp;rsquo;t know what you mean, Ray. I love you with all my heart. You said you wanted to give me whatever I wanted for my birthday. So I thought you were fine with what happened. Did I misunderstand?&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Maybe,&amp;rdquo; I postulated. &amp;ldquo;When I agreed to give you anything you wanted for your birthday you told me you wanted a three-way with you and Linda. That&amp;rsquo;s not what happened the other night in the bedroom. We didn&amp;rsquo;t have a three-way. We had three two-ways with Linda being in charge of me and you being in charge of me. I didn&amp;rsquo;t get to make any decisions. I thought I&amp;rsquo;d be fucking Linda and it turned out you both wanted her to fuck me. That was humiliating and unkind, as far as I was concerned.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Well, we didn&amp;rsquo;t mean it to be. You could have told us to stop anytime you wanted. You seemed to be enjoying it,&amp;rdquo; remarked Kathy.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Some of it I enjoyed, yes,&amp;rdquo; I said. &amp;ldquo;But the fact that you chose those roles for me and for the both of you told me a lot about what your priorities are; about what you think my role in your life should be. I&amp;rsquo;m secondary. I&amp;rsquo;m a toy, not only for you, but for Linda, too. It&amp;rsquo;s never going to be about our love or about what I want. It&amp;rsquo;s going to be about what the two of you want. And I&amp;rsquo;m always going to take a backseat to that. I&amp;rsquo;m not willing to live my life that way. My marriage is composed of two equal partners. And they aren&amp;rsquo;t my wife and her girlfriend.&amp;rdquo;" />
