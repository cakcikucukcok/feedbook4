  <title>The Christmas Wish - Erotic Short Story - Malin Edholm, Emma Ericson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&quot;I feel dizzy and light as a feather. Our hands explore each other&#39;s bodies, and all our clothes end up on the floor. When I pull her tank top over her, head, I notice that she is not wearing a bra and her nipples are stiff and erect. I pull myself away from her mouth to taste one of her nipples, and I massage her firm and small breasts as I suck and nibble them carefully. I have longed for this for so long.&quot;
It is only November, but the first snow is already falling. Tova is recently single. She loves the snow, Christmas and everything that the season has to offer but how can she enjoy it when she feels so incredibly lonely? She longs for someone to hug, someone to make love to. So, when she spots the most beautiful and sexy girl in the world at a local café, she knows that she can&#39;t let her get away. Tova has to see her again." />
