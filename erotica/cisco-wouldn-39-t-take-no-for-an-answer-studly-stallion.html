      <meta name="description" content="&amp;quot;What&amp;#39;s up, boy?&amp;quot; I turned and looked to see him practically right over my shoulder. I giggled and shoved him away. But he was insistent.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;What do you want, boy?&amp;quot; I fished out an apple and handed it to him.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
But that wasn&amp;#39;t the type of fruit he wanted.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
That&amp;#39;s when I saw it. His cock was so extended that it was practically bumping against the forest floor.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
He was horny!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Excerpt:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
It was a nice, sunny morning. I&amp;#39;d been riding Cisco for a couple hours, just meandering through the forest up and down the trails. It was good to ride again. I&amp;#39;d been away to college for the past few months and sorely missed our morning jaunts.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Apparently, Cisco had also missed our jaunts as he was a bit more frisky than normal.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I should&amp;#39;ve seen it coming. From the moment he first saw me, his large cock grew hard. I had giggled and passed it off as him just being silly. But I was soon to learn that there was more going on in that head of his than I thought.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
About two hours into our ride, I stopped and pulled out some snacks from his saddlebags. God how I missed this! I sat on my favorite stump and just watched the sunrise in silence. Well, silence other than a cachophany of birdsong in the canopy above.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
That, and Cisco whinnying behind me.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;What&amp;#39;s up, boy?&amp;quot; I turned and looked to see him practically right over my shoulder. I giggled and shoved him away. But he was insistent.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;What do you want, boy?&amp;quot; I fished out an apple and handed it to him.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
But that wasn&amp;#39;t the type of fruit he wanted.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
That&amp;#39;s when I saw it. His cock was so extended that it was practically bumping against the forest floor.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
He was horny!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Poor Cisco! There are no lady horses around, huh?&amp;quot; I sympathized. I&amp;#39;d never been with a guy myself. How many times had I needed to take care of my own business? How I&amp;#39;d longed for a guy to help me out.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Cisco thumped his engorged cock against his belly, causing me to laugh.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Sorry, bud. I&amp;#39;m not a lady horse.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
But Cisco apparently didn&amp;#39;t want a lady horse. He wanted me.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Cisco!&amp;quot; I laughed, but then stopped when I realized that he wanted me to...what? Hell, I was a virgin, I wouldn&amp;#39;t know the first thing about horny males. I mean, I&amp;#39;d watched farm animals go at it, but I wasn&amp;#39;t a farm animal.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
For the first time in my life, Cisco bared his teeth at me." />
