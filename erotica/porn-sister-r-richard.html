  <title>Porn Sister - R. Richard</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;b&gt;DESCRIPTION:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Jim has a successful computer store business in a little town he calls Zero. His sister Judy went off to be a film star, but only made it in porn films. Judy comes back to Zero, in quite a bit of trouble. Jim has shelter, Judy has something to trade.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;EXCERPT:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Then, something happened that had an enormous impact on my business. I met a guy named Juan Hernandez, through the State Police. Juan Hernandez did some work with the State Police, mainly on stolen cars that wound up in Mexico.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I then got a source of old, obsolete computers that could be sold in Mexico. With the help of Juan Hernandez, I began to ship the old computers into Mexico and sell them there. Since I had a business in Mexico, I got a Mexican bank account and even an account with a Mexican stock broker.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
By now, I had a dozen large customers, down at the Computer Store, and a half dozen guys working for me, servicing my customers. The money was rolling in and I had everything I needed, except pussy.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I got home, after work, one evening, to find my sister Judy waiting for me. I hadn&amp;rsquo;t seen or heard from Judy for a couple of years. I asked my sister, &amp;ldquo;Judy, what brings you back to Zero?&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Judy says, &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;m in big trouble, You gotta help me.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I ask her, &amp;ldquo;What kind of trouble?&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Judy says, &amp;ldquo;First, I gotta get this car off the street.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I open the gate and Judy drives a big Mercedes into my place and she parks it in the garage, out of sight from the street.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
We go into the house and Judy tells me her story.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Mom and I moved to Los Angeles. I was gonna be a big film star. I applied here and auditioned there, but the only thing that I could get were a few extra parts in films. Mom was barely making ends meet and couldn&amp;rsquo;t support me any longer. I turned 18 years old and I finally got a real role in a film. Unfortunately, it wasn&amp;rsquo;t a Hollywood film, it was a porno film. I hated the work, but the money was good. I started to move up the ladder a bit and got some near star roles. I also got involved with the business of the making of porno films and I met some real creeps. I moved in with a fringe player in the porno film industry. One day, my room mate came home with a couple of bullets in him and a bunch of money. My room mate died, in my arms. I threw my stuff in his car, the Mercedes, and ran. If the people who shot my room mate find me, I&amp;rsquo;m dead. So, here I am.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I tell my sister, &amp;ldquo;I have a place for you to stay. I can sell the car, in Mexico, where no one in the USA will ever find it. I can get you a bank account in Mexico. If you want, I can even set you up producing porno films, from here. In return, you gotta fuck me, on a regular basis.&amp;rdquo;" />
