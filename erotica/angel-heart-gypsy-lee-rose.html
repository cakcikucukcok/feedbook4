      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Angel is an insatiable woman, one who proudly and shamelessly pursues her passions.

&lt;p&gt;In the summer of January 2011, Angel meets a man who must be conquered at all costs. Zane Channing is sexy, hunky, and mysterious, and their sexual chemistry is explosive. As the summer ends, Angel begins to scheme to find a way to keep Zane in her life and her bed. Despite her blinding lust, she has to admit that something just doesnt quite add up about her lover. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With only memories of his hot body to keep her sane during the doldrums of her work days at an accounting firm, Angel grows restless. Fortunately, her nightlife has a bit more spice. She and her best friend, Braxton, run an exclusive barand they are partners in every sense of the word. But how long with their secret stay secret? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But when another secret is exposed, Angels life is in jeopardy. She fights for a way to bring Zane back into her life as her protector and her lover. But how will she respond when his secrets are also exposed? Zane has only one thing on his mindhow he can keep his beloved Angel safe. As lives and lies intertwine, no one is safe in Auburn Creek. &lt;/p&gt;" />
