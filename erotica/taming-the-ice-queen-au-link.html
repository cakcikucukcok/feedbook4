  <title>Taming the Ice Queen - Au Link</title>
      <meta name="description" content="After seven years, all she wanted was a healthy, handsome, rich, powerful, in shape, and loving man, who would take her and love her until she forgot her name, while she could lounge by their pool and work as she pleased! That was really not that much to ask!
She had superpowers! How could it be so hard?
~~~~~ PG Excerpt ~~~~~
Rose stared at the ceiling of her dorm room.
Even with a thousand college students traipsing in and out at all hours, the place was way too quiet! She was having serious trouble adjusting to life on the outside. It was not the big things like being able to come and go as she pleased, or not having metal bars, chain link fence, razor wire and guards around her that bothered her.
The little things were making her crazy. On the inside she could not go anywhere before morning count, on the outside her feet wanted to stand at the side of her bunk until the doors opened and she stepped out for count, where she had to stand in place until the whole section cleared count. It was the carpet under her feet, and not the ugly stained concrete of the unit that triggered her to realize that she was somewhere strange and needed to think for a moment. That frustration was constant and cutting.
There was that annoying boy who ignored her! Inside, she was a bad little bitch who other women respected, if not feared outright. Rose knew she could beat almost any other woman’s ass with her fists, and make a group regret picking her as a target, but she was not a convict anymore, she was on parole and in the free-world. She was respected even before the whole powers thing happened and she became truly powerful and untouchable. He treated her with a passive, not contempt, but maybe it was indifference, that just annoyed the hell out of her. He was like a splinter under her fingernail; she could pretend to ignore him, but her mind kept looping back around to him irritating her.
He was older than the boys in her class were. Maybe that was why he caught her eye. That may be why he was a little standoffish too. Maybe he looked at her as just another annoying college kid, like she viewed the rest of her peers.
What the hell was he doing shaking her hand! On the inside, you could not touch anyone or some jealous bitch would drop a report and get you in trouble, just to make you miserable. And it was like &#39;a handshake&#39;? That was such a tease! It was like saying, &#39;hi, you&#39;re here, I&#39;m here, but you&#39;re not good enough for more.&#39;
The whole thing irritated Rose to the core, for some reason.
Rose also desperately wanted to get laid! She was only sixteen when she got in trouble and went away. All her male experience was with a few kisses, some feels and one less than spectacular short-lived relationship; the relationship was fine, but they were both young and neither knew what they were doing.
Of course, it was that relationship and the little bitch that he was cheating with that got her in trouble in the first place! Her fury frothed high and disturbed her calm the more she thought about it.
She thought it was going to be easy, but finding a man worth her time was driving her to distraction! Her Gran kept telling her, &#39;only a man worth your time, this time, Rose!&#39;
After seven years, all she wanted was a healthy, handsome, rich, powerful, in shape, and loving man, who would take her and love her until she forgot her name, while she could lounge by their pool and work as she pleased! That was really not that much to ask!
