  <title>Doggy Sex Leads to Blackmail Incest: (A Smut Novella) - Deedee Zee</title>
      <meta name="description" content="A hard day at work leads to Georgie just wanting to go home and take a nap. She runs into her brother on the way to her room, but refuses to let him bug her. Her bed is calling. When she gets to it, though, it&amp;rsquo;s not sleep that happens. Suddenly, she&amp;rsquo;s horny. Really horny. And the family dog is eager to help satisfy her.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Unfortunately, her brother saw it all and recorded it, using the video and the threat of uploading it as blackmail to get her to do every sexual thing he wants. But is it really just blackmail that&amp;rsquo;s making her so compliant or something else? There&amp;rsquo;s something up with her brother&amp;rsquo;s phone. She just knows that&amp;rsquo;s the key even if she isn&amp;rsquo;t sure how.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This&amp;nbsp;&lt;b&gt;FICTION&lt;/b&gt;&amp;nbsp;short is for&amp;nbsp;&lt;b&gt;ENTERTAINMENT PURPOSES ONLY&lt;/b&gt;&amp;nbsp;and is intended for&amp;nbsp;&lt;b&gt;MATURE AUDIENCES ONLY (18+)&lt;/b&gt;. It contains bestiality dog sex, brother-sister incest sex, dubious consent, mind control, blackmail, oral sex, exhibitionism, and bareback creampie." />
