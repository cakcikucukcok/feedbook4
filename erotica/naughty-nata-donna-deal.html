  <title>Naughty Nata - Donna Deal</title>
      <meta name="description" content="In the beginning, Annette, who is obsessed with why golfers participate in the activities of strip bars on a golf trip to Myrtle Beach, SC, decides to do her own investigation on why a husband would come home with the smell of exotic perfume and make up on his golf shirt. She decides to work out her frustrations by getting a group of other housewives to go on a short vacation to experience what the life of a stripper is all about and why it has become the in thing to do with the majority of men who take a week every year to head for the Golf Capital of the World. These guys not only shoot for who plays the better golf but they follow up by hitting the strip clubs for the nightlife away from home fun and games that suck hundreds of dollar bills out of their pockets and give them the half-naked entertainment that goes along with it!
Annette, Judy, Jan, and Tina are all in for the worst nightmare of their lives as they get caught up in a group of what appeared to them to be the average golfers hanging out at the Pussy Cat Galore Strip Club. They experience the control of a very influential sexually explicit, violent, and tortuous group that tricks them into following the leads of their favorite stripper, Naughty Nata and how she performs for their pleasures in the VIP room. 
Ending up in the Russian Federation Militia underground, puts all at risk of never returning home to their families again after becoming sexual slaves at the hands of these horrible people. The end results are very devastating and lead to the imagination of the reading audience as to what happens next! Coming soon &quot;Anna Bella&quot;, the sequel to this book." />
