  <title>Rebecca&#39;s Tale - K.W. Steiner</title>
      <meta name="description" content="DESCRIPTION:&lt;br /&gt;
Rebecca Thomas, nurse, wife and mother, learns to deal with her incestuous affair with her son, as well as discovering that she is still a very sexual being as she nears 50. From submitting to her soon-to-be son-in-law&amp;#39;s advances, to granting an evening with a handsome young bartender, Rebecca no longer fears &amp;quot;getting older&amp;quot;.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
EXCERPT:&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Mom! Paul! I&amp;#39;m back!&amp;rdquo; came Audrey&amp;rsquo;s voice from the entry hallway, and before either of them could act, Rebecca&amp;#39;s daughter, Paul&amp;#39;s fianc&amp;eacute;, stood in the doorway looking at them with shock and horror plastered across her face. What Audrey saw, burned into her mind in that instant was her mother, naked and astride her fianc&amp;eacute;, with his cock wedged into her dripping pussy, while her hand attempted to hide that very fact.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Audrey!&amp;rdquo; both Rebecca and Paul gasped at the same instant. There would be no denial, of that it was clear. They had been caught, red handed and bare-assed naked.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Noooo!&amp;rdquo; Audrey wailed as she turned and ran from the room. She ran up the stairs and a moment later, a bedroom door slammed hard.&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;I guess maybe we&amp;#39;d better stop,&amp;rdquo; Paul muttered a moment later. His cock, still wedged up inside Rebecca, was slowly deflating already.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Rebecca maintained her position, however, and looked back at Paul. &amp;ldquo;We might as well finish up. It&amp;#39;s not like it&amp;#39;ll matter in the end, will it?&amp;rdquo; And she began to roll and grind her hips once again, bringing his cock back to full strength in moments.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
It wasn&amp;#39;t long before Paul began to grunt and huff beneath her, and soon Rebecca&amp;#39;s pussy was flooded with his hot cum. Neither had made much noise, however, and even as he climaxed, Paul let out little more than a grunt and gasp. When the last of his throbbing had subsided, Rebecca eased herself up and off Paul&amp;#39;s withering manhood. She leaked somewhat, but quickly pulled her underwear on to prevent a gushing flood. She gave Paul a quick kiss, and then told him, &amp;ldquo;I&amp;#39;ll take care of Audrey. You&amp;#39;d better get cleaned up and maybe you might want to eat out tonight. I&amp;#39;ll let you know how things go, later.&amp;rdquo;" />
