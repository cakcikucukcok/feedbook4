  <title>The Festival Of Heart: The Count of Lathania No.1 - Fox Williams</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;b&gt;DESCRIPTION:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
In this sensational tale of romance and forbidden desire, a young noblewoman is arranged to marry a fearsome warlord from a distant country. This warlord carries a dark secret that may threaten any hope of love the woman possesses. Or perhaps it is her grasp of faith which will meet with a doom from the flames of desire. : warrior male sex, historical romance sex, sexy romance story, love triangle, erotica with plot, medieval romance sex, good sexy plot, man and woman, Domination &amp;amp; Submission BDSM&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;EXCERPT:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
It was then that Mila met her betrothed for the first time. Immediately, she was drawn to his eyes. They were a shade she had never witnessed before on a human face. Red. Likely, they were a unique shade of brown, but in the sun&amp;rsquo;s light, they reflected an almost red-like color. Those eyes sat in a face that would not be called traditionally handsome. His lips were larger than the ones she knew at home. His nose clearly once broken. But his cheekbones were strong and his jaw held a sharp edge.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Yet the man before her was at least twice her age. He kept a trimmed beard that grew around his mouth, beneath his nose, and only just tickled along his jawline. It, like his hair that reached his ears, was a myriad of colors. Mostly, it was grey, but it had within it shades of darker grey, black, and even white. There were a few wrinkles that marred his skin, but Mila could not say that they were happy lines. Instead, wrinkles of worry and perhaps even grief.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
In all, her assessment that the man appeared distant. Attractive in his own way, certainly, distinguished, but there was an aura around him that made one instantly wary of him. As if one was unsure if he would embrace or attack one at any given moment. He did not speak after her arrival. Instead, those red eyes of his looked over her own form. She felt a knot form in her stomach when he lingered on her hips. As he estimated her worth, his steward beside him introduced him.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;It is a pleasure to receive the Lady and company of House Oldstone to Castle Rustik. Allow me to present His Lordship, Count Kalmin of House Rustik,&amp;rdquo; the steward bowed after his introduction.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;We are honored to make your acquaintance, my lord,&amp;rdquo; her Aunt curtsied. Mila followed her example, head lowering towards the stone steps.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
When she resumed her former stance, head lifting, her betrothed&amp;rsquo;s back was already to her. &amp;ldquo;Come,&amp;rdquo; was his only response." />
