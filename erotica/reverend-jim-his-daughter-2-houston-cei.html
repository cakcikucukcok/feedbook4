  <title>Reverend Jim &amp; His Daughter 2 - Houston Cei</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The beautiful former porn star Roxanne Hansen continues her amorous adventures in the following novella in which she and her husband enhance their sex life in a variety of ways, including some wife-swapping. In their getaway adventure on a private island they are met by an equally sensuous couple who happen to be cruising by on a yacht. The two couples find that they have very much in common.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
~~~~~ Excerpt ~~~~~&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
As she was browsing the internet she came across a site offering privacy on a small island in the Bahamas where there were only seven native bamboo huts with thatched roofs. Most of the island was owned by one multi-millionaire and the concept was to be as close to the aborigine life-style as possible. There was no electricity but ice chests would be provided with ice available at the one and only store on the island. There would no stove; however, there would be a barbecue pit in front of each hut and campfires were allowed. Since there was no electricity, kerosene lanterns would be provided for lighting. The huts were close to the beach where there would be a dock with canoes and room for a small yacht to anchor. Close by was the small store, powered by a generator, that stocked a limited variety of food items and other essentials. The final words on the internet promotion were &amp;quot;be prepared.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Gregory was not about to deny his wife&amp;#39;s request to reserve one of these huts after seeing how enthusiastically she described the scene as presented online. She made all the necessary arrangements, including the airlines reservations. They would fly to Miami and there would be a small prop plane with water landing capabilities that would be taking them to the private island. There was no major runway, and the seaplane would return on a designated date.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;What an adventure!&amp;quot; Gregory exclaimed, &amp;quot;It&amp;#39;s almost like being stranded on a Gilligan&amp;#39;s Island. Roxanne, you outdid yourself, but I hope the pilot doesn&amp;#39;t forget to pick us up.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
After all was said and done, Roxanne said to Gregory, &amp;quot;One more thing, sweetheart: no sex until we arrive on the island.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;You&amp;#39;ve got to be kidding!&amp;quot; he exclaimed.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;I absolutely am not kidding,&amp;quot; she responded. &amp;quot;The anticipation will enhance the pleasure when we finally do it. Let&amp;#39;s just think about having sex with each other until we finally get there.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Are you sure you can go that long?&amp;quot; he asked with a chuckle as their eyes met.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;It&amp;#39;ll be rough but I think I can make it,&amp;quot; she said and then after a short pause added, &amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m more worried about you. No jacking off!&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
He laughed at her last exclamation and said, &amp;quot;Okay, you have my word. I won&amp;#39;t whip it.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
On their previous visit to Maui the honeymooners had a wonderful time but they had every intention of out doing themselves on this first anniversary celebration. The sound of the seaplane&amp;#39;s propeller and the view of the turquoise waters of the ocean below enhanced their excitement as they were minutes away from the island. After landing and being escorted to their hut by the pilot, he said, &amp;quot;Well folks, this is as far as I go. You&amp;#39;re on your own now, and I&amp;#39;ll see you in two weeks. Have fun.&amp;quot; The pilot&amp;#39;s leaving abruptly without showing them around was meant to be part of the adventure." />
