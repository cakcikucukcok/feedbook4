&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Wow, Nayo. That feels&amp;hellip;fantastic.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
He could hear the smile in her voice as she moved her hands to his shoulders. &amp;ldquo;My instructor said I had good hands. Of course, she might have just been trying to get into my pants.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Uh-huh.&amp;rdquo; He closed his eyes, his body sinking into lethargy. Then her actual words penetrated. &amp;ldquo;Wait. She might have been trying to get into your pants?&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Yes.&amp;rdquo; Her hands didn&amp;rsquo;t cease their delightful movement, but her fingers gripped him hard around the shoulders, making him wince. &amp;ldquo;Why? Do you have a problem with that?&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;No. Not if you don&amp;rsquo;t.&amp;rdquo; Mindful of the fact that she needed to do her job, he kept his shrug to the barest twitch of a shoulder. &amp;ldquo;Did you ever&amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Her hands moved down his arms to his biceps, her thumbs digging deep into the large muscles there. He could feel her shifting on the bed to keep a good angle. Her knees were on either side of his thighs. &amp;ldquo;No. Oh, once, maybe. But not with her. Just a little fooling around with one of my girlfriends when she brought some wine from home and we tried it one night. You know how it is. You&amp;rsquo;re lonely, you&amp;rsquo;re far from home, you&amp;rsquo;re escaping all the religious bullshit you&amp;rsquo;ve been brought up with&amp;hellip;and you start to wonder. Am I a lesbian? Or am I just hornier than hell?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;So we got a little tipsy and played truth or dare. Three of us. And when Linda dared Kimberly and me to make out, we did.&amp;rdquo; She shifted again, her strong little hands working on either side of his spine. &amp;ldquo;I liked it,&amp;rdquo; she continued blithely, shocking Luke to his core. &amp;ldquo;And I think I would have liked it more if we&amp;rsquo;d gone a little bit further. Kimberly&amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo; her voice trailed off. &amp;ldquo;I think she just got caught up in the moment. The next day she was complaining about her hangover and how she couldn&amp;rsquo;t remember anything. But the way she looked at me made me sure that she did remember. And she wasn&amp;rsquo;t sure whether she liked it or not.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;So&amp;hellip;what are you saying?&amp;rdquo; he asked, feeling as if he were tiptoeing through a minefield. In the dark. Blindfolded. &amp;ldquo;Are you&amp;hellip;you&amp;rsquo;re not a lesbian? Are you?&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;No. Moron.&amp;rdquo; She slapped his rear, the sound echoing through the small room. She ignored his hiss of pain with serene indifference. &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;m not even bisexual. But sex isn&amp;rsquo;t binary, you know. When you get to USD you&amp;rsquo;ll have your nose rubbed in that.&amp;rdquo; She moved again, all the way down to the bottom of the bed, where she could massage his calves. More oil hit his skin. &amp;ldquo;Thank God you&amp;rsquo;re not too hairy down here. I swear, some guys I&amp;rsquo;ve been with, they look like Bigfoot.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Anyway, when you come with me to Vermilion, you&amp;rsquo;ll see that it&amp;rsquo;s true. There are gays and lesbians and some trans students. And there are bisexuals as well. We have ten thousand people on campus. Hell, Luke, it&amp;rsquo;s got almost as many students on campus as live in this entire town.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;So&amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo; he was growing even more confused. &amp;ldquo;You&amp;rsquo;re not bisexual? But you&amp;rsquo;d like making out with a girl?&amp;rdquo;" />
