  <title>Punishing Penelope - Anna Austin</title>
      <meta name="description" content="At St Severine&amp;#39;s School for Turbulent Girls, young ladies between the ages of eighteen and twenty-one are sent receive the discipline they so desperately require...&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Penelope may be from a good family, but her rebellious nature lands her in constant trouble. Finally, her parents have had enough, and send her to St Severine&amp;#39;s for correction.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
~~~~~ PG Excerpt ~~~~~&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Though he was older (I would assume that he was around my father&amp;#39;s age), he was quite striking, looks-wise. He has a sharp, well-defined jawline, and his dark grey eyes were intimidating to the point where looking him directly in the eye would reduce me to a puddle.&amp;nbsp; I tried my best to avoid thinking of him in this way, but he made it nearly impossible, seeing as he taught me every day of the week.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
His main subject was maths, which just so happened to be my worst subject. My brain didn&amp;#39;t work in that way, and solving problems in front of the whole class was a nerve-wracking experience, to say the least. I&amp;#39;m sure Professor Knott got some sort of entertainment out of putting me on the spot, though. So far, the problems had been easy enough, but according to the other girls, things would get progressively harder as the year went on. I dreaded that.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
After a week and a half at the academy, I&amp;#39;d started thinking of Professor Knott more regularly. Though I was thoroughly ashamed of it, I had been seeing him in my dreams, as well. The dreams had been very sexual in nature - dreams wherein I longed to be punished by him. He would give me a once-over with those piercing grey eyes of his, and order me to bend over." />
