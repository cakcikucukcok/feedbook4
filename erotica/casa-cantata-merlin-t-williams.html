  <title>Casa Cantata - Merlin T. Williams</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Michael Campbell is a family man. He has a precocious three-year-old daughter, and she is the love of his life. The family is fractured, however, due to a road accident that claimed the childs mother. Michael is a single parent who struggles mightily to provide his child, Christina, with some semblance of a normal life.
Normal, because Michaels life, in his other world, the world of adults and the business that they conduct, is far from normal.
Enter the Tan family. It is said that the rich and their lifestyles are the envy of those who can only gaze, grovel, or be gracious from afar. Mr. and Mrs. Tan are the rich among the rich in Singapore. 
Michael is compelled to dance the dance of intimacy with them by forces that not even he fully understands.
He is ushered into their world of splendor, of sensory overload, and of serpentine intrigue because of a simple misunderstanding. That misunderstanding creates a cascade of events that change Michael, and his daughter, forever.
Michael is a wounded man. And even though his injury is unwittingly self-inflected, it is taken advantage of by others who introduce him to an agenda that is not his own. Power behind the power in the world becomes his master.
Michael is well grounded in the world that he shares with Christina, but the constant movement of the unstable tectonic plates in his other life render him vulnerable to their deadly ring of fire.
Follow him as humor, honest effort and the helping hands of others enable him to maintain the balance needed to straddle the great divide that defines his life." />
