  <title>Let It Snow - Abra Harrington</title>
      <meta name="description" content="DESCRIPTION:&lt;br /&gt;
College freshman Riley Kendrick has always been attracted to Seth, a young man his parents adopted as a teen, and Seth&amp;#39;s wife, Carol; he&amp;#39;s convinced he&amp;#39;ll never have either of them. But when he catches them being intimate in his bed with only two weeks before Christmas, his lonely world is rapidly turned upside down.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
EXCERPT:&lt;br /&gt;
He&amp;#39;d been frustrated with pent-up desire all day. Riley wanted nothing more than a quick release. He would have taken any chance if he&amp;#39;d been given one&amp;mdash;he was so desperate he would have given himself a quickie in a closet without a second thought. But there were no closets placed conveniently along the icy streets, so Riley was forced to wait and continue trudging through the heavy snowfall all the way back to his apartment building.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
He would have taken care of himself that morning, but he&amp;rsquo;d woken up late and had to rush out into the snow. Then it was only after he&amp;#39;d arrived on campus that he realized classes had been canceled because of the upcoming blizzard. Then he&amp;#39;d been forced to walk all the way back to his apartment. The first thing he was going to do when he got back was take care of himself.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
He pushed his door open with a sigh. It clicked shut quietly behind him while he shrugged off his coat and shook snow out of his brown hair. As he did so, he heard a faint creak, and somebody&amp;#39;s voice.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Riley froze. Somebody was in his apartment. Both of his roommates were gone, having taken off for Christmas vacation early the day before&amp;mdash;so that meant&amp;hellip;he grabbed a baseball bat by the door, ventured cautiously into the kitchenette, and held his breath.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
There it was again: somebody&amp;#39;s voice, a woman&amp;mdash;and another voice, deeper. Two people, then. Riley looked around quickly. Nothing had been taken, as far as he could see. Yet. He followed the noises, and froze again when the woman seemed to yelp. Then she groaned.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
What the hell? Riley eased through the little living area and came to his bedroom door; it was cracked open&amp;mdash;he&amp;#39;d left it closed when he&amp;#39;d left.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The man said something low, almost a growl&amp;mdash;Riley caught the word &amp;quot;babe,&amp;quot; followed by a long, low, &amp;quot;Riley.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Riley pushed his bedroom door open cautiously, bat held at the ready. The bat dropped a moment later, and he stood with his hand on the doorknob, gaping.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Two people were banging in his bed. A woman with straight, blonde hair that reached her perfect butt was sitting on top of a man. She arched her back and whimpered, her ample breasts bouncing while she and her partner worked their hips together in hard, rapid thrusts. She was beautiful; so was her male friend. His skin was a shade darker than Riley&amp;#39;s, and put him in mind of Hawaii. They both gave the impression of being in their mid- or late twenties.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Riley&amp;mdash;&amp;quot; the woman purred, and Riley recognized them with the force of having an anvil dropped on his head." />
