  <title>Losing the Cherry - J.R. Shane</title>
      <meta name="description" content="DESCRIPTION:&lt;br /&gt;
We all remember that first time, when it happened, where it happened, and with whom it happened. This five tale collection of first time stories includes a wide range of sexual activities.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
EXCERPT:&lt;br /&gt;
We all remember that first time, when it happened, where it happened, and with whom it happened.&amp;nbsp; It was a benchmark in our lives that we will carry forth as long as we live.&amp;nbsp; But life provides us with a regular progression of &amp;lsquo;first times&amp;rsquo;, each as memorable as the one that happened before.&amp;nbsp; All are carefully cataloged away within our minds to be recalled during the quiet hours in our lives, and as memories to brighten those dark days when we can no longer do the things we could years ago.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
1. Becky is the story of an ordinary young woman with a loving mother and stepfather who both want her first experience to be as wonderful as it can be.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
2. Her First Handjob follows a young and relatively innocent couple who go farther in their sexual play than they ever have before.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
3. Ben and Morty are two young and inexperienced college boys who are swept into the lives of older bisexual men who show them what the &amp;lsquo;other side&amp;rsquo; is like.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
4. Ms. K is the story of a young man who is about to start college and finds that his older brother has a secret lover. A lover who gives him his first sexual experience and offers the potential for years of ongoing pleasure.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
5. Old Swingers First experiences are not just for the young. Sometimes, even in our &amp;lsquo;golden years&amp;rsquo;, the opportunity for new and different experiences will present itself." />
