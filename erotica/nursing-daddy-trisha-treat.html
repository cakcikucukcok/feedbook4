  <title>Nursing Daddy - Trisha Treat</title>
      <meta name="description" content="When Daddy walks in on his daughter Kimberly nursing her three year old son, he is shocked that she is still lactating. He is mesmerized by her full, luscious breasts, and after his grandson is put to bed, Daddy decides he has to have a taste. Kimberly is more than willing to nurse her Daddy, enjoying the sexual attention that motherhood has robbed her of. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EXCERPT:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I looked up to see Daddy watching me intently from the doorway. He crossed the room and sat down next to me on the couch, staring at my exposed, milky tits while my son nursed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&quot;You&#39;re still breastfeeding?&quot; Daddy asked me with a tone of disbelief.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&quot;Yes,&quot; I replied defensively. &quot;The newest studies show it&#39;s good for him!&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Daddy didn&#39;t take his eyes off of my breasts. I could nearly feel the heat from his gaze, and something about it actually made me wet between my legs. I hadn&#39;t had a man stare at my naked breasts like that since before my son was born. It was arousing. I shifted uncomfortably in my seat, a little embarrassed, but turned on enough to not try to cover myself." />
