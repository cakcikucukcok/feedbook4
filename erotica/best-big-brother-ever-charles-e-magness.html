  <title>Best Big Brother Ever - Charles E. Magness</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Bryan has been in love with college sophomore Vicki ever since he can remember. Her body has fascinated him for years, and he knows that she likes him.&amp;nbsp; But he can&amp;#39;t confess his love, let alone his lust, because there&amp;#39;s a little problem.&amp;nbsp; Well, actually, it&amp;#39;s a big problem.&amp;nbsp; She&amp;#39;s his little sister, and he knows that if she understood what he really wants, she&amp;#39;d never want to see him or talk to him again.&lt;br /&gt;
Now their parents have conspired with a winter storm to send Bryan and Vicki&amp;mdash;just the two of them&amp;mdash;on a multi-day road trip from Denver to Seattle. Will Brian be able to keep his secret from Vicki while the two of them spend three days alone with each other in the confined space of their mother&amp;#39;s car?&amp;nbsp; And what about the nights&amp;mdash;when they will share a motel room?&lt;br /&gt;
Just when Bryan thinks he can get through this trip with his secret safe, Vicki&amp;#39;s current boyfriend throws a tool-chest full of monkey wrenches into things.&amp;nbsp; Find out what happens then in &amp;quot;Best Big Brother Ever.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
~~~~~ PG Excerpt ~~~~~&lt;br /&gt;
We sat there awhile longer, silently; once more I felt the rhythmic little motions of her body, and now I also smelled the perfumes she emitted. Now, too, I was hyper-aware of the way her body pressed against me.&lt;br /&gt;
Without warning, she raised her head and looked up into my eyes. She reached up and pulled my head down, bringing our lips together. Hers parted, and her tongue reached to enter my mouth. Surprised, not knowing quite what to do, I let nature take its course. My own tongue danced with hers as our arms tightened about each other, and that heavenly kiss extended into deep time.&lt;br /&gt;
At last she broke away, and I opened the eyes I didn&amp;rsquo;t remember closing. My feelings of guilt, already strong on account of what I had wanted for so long&amp;mdash;and now wanted even more&amp;mdash;intensified in me, and I said, &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;m sorry, Vicki. I shouldn&amp;rsquo;t have done that.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;You did exactly what you should have,&amp;rdquo; she said. &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;ve wanted to kiss you like that for a long time, and I finally did. And you kissed me back&amp;mdash;just like I wanted you to. Didn&amp;rsquo;t you like it?&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Vicki, of course I liked it. How could a man not like a kiss from such a wonderful woman? But&amp;mdash;&amp;ldquo;&lt;br /&gt;
She put her hand over my mouth again, interrupting me and said, &amp;ldquo;And you&amp;rsquo;re a wonderful man, Bry. The best.&amp;rdquo; She paused, but her hand still blocked my mouth, stifling any reply I might make. She looked into my eyes again and, after we&amp;rsquo;d exchanged looks for a few seconds, she said, &amp;ldquo;You want to, don&amp;rsquo;t you!&amp;rdquo;" />
