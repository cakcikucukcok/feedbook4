  <title>Old Babes, Young Bucks - J.R. Shane</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;b&gt;DESCRIPTION:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
This compilation of stories is based largely upon personal experiences and fantasies. The ultimate fantasy for any young man would be to find a patient older woman who will tolerate his lack of skill in exchange for his boundless enthusiasm and resilience. To anyone who has known that experience, you know exactly what I am writing about. If you have not, I hope that these stories bring you some of the intensity such a relationship generates.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;EXCERPT:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Chris I want you to know something. George and I were married for over fifty years and he was the only man I ever slept with. Now that he&amp;rsquo;s gone, I have spent a lot of time thinking about what I want to do with the rest of my years. Recently my doctor suggested that I may not have that many more years so I&amp;rsquo;ve decided to make the most of whatever I have left. This can be a very special relationship for both of us, but what cannot happen is you telling anyone about us. I have to live my remaining years in this neighborhood and I don&amp;rsquo;t want to be known as an old crone who goes around seducing young men. What I&amp;rsquo;m asking you is, can you keep your mouth shut?&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Yes, of course I can.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;All right then, just don&amp;rsquo;t forget that.&amp;rdquo; She turned from me and faced the bed.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I stood silently not knowing what to do when she turned back around.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Are you going to unzip me?&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I felt so stupid. Nervously I fumbled with the long zipper at the back of her dress until finally it fell open. She stepped out of the dress and hung it on a tall bedpost, then she turned to me again.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Do you need a written invitation?&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I had been so nervous and excited by everything that I had stood watching her instead of undressing. I began to unbutton my shirt.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;On second thought, I think I want to unwrap you like the lovely gift that you are to me.&amp;rdquo; Her hands replaced mine, steadily unbuttoning my shirt. Once the sleeves were loose, she opened my belt and pulled out my shirt. I slid my shirt off and looked at Beverly&amp;rsquo;s smiling face. She came close and began to run her hands over my chest and belly. &amp;ldquo;This is SO nice. I watched you outside working in the yard yesterday, the sweat glistening on your body. So firm, so solid, I had a sudden urge to rush out and lick the sweat from you. Do you know how many years it has been since I&amp;rsquo;ve had feelings like that?&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;I...er...no.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
She interrupted me. &amp;ldquo;Let&amp;rsquo;s just say it has been a while. It was nice to again feel those pangs of desire, to feel that tingle between my legs. I had honestly forgotten about feelings like that. I came up here and peeled off my bra and put on the tightest top I have just hoping to catch your attention.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;You sure did that.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;I didn&amp;rsquo;t know if my saggy old titties were still even worth looking at, but when I saw you staring, ZING, right between my legs. It was great.&amp;rdquo;" />
