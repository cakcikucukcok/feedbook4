  <title>Vampires of the Future and the Planet of Bondage - M. Wedjat Loe</title>
      <meta name="description" content="It was once believed that the Earth was the center of the Universe. &lt;br&gt;
In time, it was proven that our World is but one grain of sand upon an eternal shore.&lt;br&gt;
It was once believed that there was but one Universe in all existence.&lt;br&gt;
In time, it was proven that our Universe is but one volume of many, upon but one of an entire library of shelves.&lt;br&gt;
It was once believed that Humanity existed upon a single World.&lt;br&gt;
In time, it was proven that the numbers of planets inhabited by Humans are countless.&lt;br&gt;
It was once believed that the Vampire was a myth, conjured up from the darkest shadows of the Human imagination.&lt;br&gt;
In time, it was proven that the Nosferatu is a very real creature, and a very real threat.&lt;br&gt;
Welcome to the Wreath Galaxy of Parallel Universe 2264.&lt;br&gt;
Hidden deep within the shimmering clusters of Suns is the Planet of 100 Continents.&lt;br&gt;
Here, turning on its mighty axis is a World so large, it literally contains eight hemispheres, and nights are a decade long.&lt;br&gt;
Upon this celestial colossus, two superpowers battle for supremacy over the Future: the Vampires, which rule the Realm of Night, and the Zeanotists, the fanatical Sun-worshipping Mega-theocracy which rules the Realm of Day.  &lt;br&gt; 
In Episode One, the planet continues to turn on its mammoth axis, and dawn approaches the Realm of the Zeanotists, ending another decade of constant night.&lt;br&gt;
The ultra-masochistic Vampire-Witch, assassin and saboteur extraordinaire, Vespertilia, has accepted a covert mission, in an attempt to impress her mysterious, hidden contact, the ever-elusive ICONOCLAST, to hamstring a plot concocted by a confederacy of Zeanotist conspirators.&lt;br&gt;
It is a lucrative venture, earning her a valuable booty of the tasty blood of over one hundred slaves as payment.&lt;br&gt;
It is also an elaborate trap, the likes of which will take the Immortal anti-heroine to a level of torment that will test the limits of her physical, psychological and supernatural endurance.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Welcome to a realm of dominance and submission, of sadistic force and masochistic surrender, and of predators and prey.
Welcome to a dominion where blessings are sometimes found in the depths of shadows, and where curses can be delivered upon the rays of the Sun.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Welcome to a planet that is home to bloodthirsty monsters, ruthless Humans, wondrous aliens, fantastic robots, political intrigue, religious treachery, miraculous technology and devastating sex.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Here is the World known to Humans as Centum, to Vampires as Coagulus, and to a vast majority of tormented Souls as the Planet of Bondage.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;" />
