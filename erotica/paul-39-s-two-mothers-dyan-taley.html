&lt;br /&gt;
~~~~~ Excerpt ~~~~~&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;...I was on the internet the other day and I read this article about something called GSA. Ever heard of it?&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This was part of my plan, you see, to gently get us to both admit to the feelings we had for each other. But Paul&amp;#39;s body language changed, became secretive as he answered, &amp;quot;No, mum, I haven&amp;#39;t.&amp;quot; he said and I knew he was lying.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Well,&amp;quot; I went on, moving a little closer to him and noting that his trousers were starting to tent a little&amp;nbsp; sure you haven&amp;#39;t heard of it!&amp;nbsp; &amp;quot;it&amp;#39;s about people like us. You know, family members who weren&amp;#39;t brought up as a family and who met later on.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;OK&amp;quot;, Paul said, his breathing a little faster than normal. I recognised the signs. He&amp;#39;s thinking he might get lucky&amp;#39; tonight. It reassured me. If he felt that way, both of us would be getting lucky.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Apparently, in those situations, the people involved&amp;nbsp; and it can happen to any family combination, father-daughter, sister-brother, mother-son&amp;nbsp; apparently they can end up feeling attracted to one another. You know, romantically&amp;quot; I said, shifting my position so that my skirt hiked up a little, exposing some of my upper thigh, &amp;quot;Sexually, even. Have you ever had feelings like that, honey?&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Paul shifted his position, I think to hide his growing erection. His breathing was faster now, and I think he was considering his options. I&amp;#39;m so glad he chose honesty.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Yes, mum,&amp;quot; he replied, staring me straight in the face, &amp;quot;I have had feelings like that about you.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Well, there it was, out in the open. I was so pleased that my beautiful boy had come clean at last. And I wasn&amp;#39;t going to leave him hanging. &amp;quot;Well, that&amp;#39;s OK, honey, it&amp;#39;s perfectly natural. I&amp;#39;ve had similar feelings like that about you.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;You have?&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;You sound surprised. You&amp;#39;re a tall, handsome, gorgeous young man.&amp;quot; I let my hand rest on his thigh, accidental-like. &amp;quot;I&amp;#39;d have to be made of stone not to find you attractive.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
He was embarrassed, but also really turned on, I could sense it. &amp;quot;Well, that&amp;#39;s true of you, too, mum. You&amp;#39;re a beautiful woman. It&amp;#39;d be hard for me not to feel, you know...&amp;quot;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I leaned forward towards him, looking him in the eyes &amp;quot;...sexually attracted.&amp;quot; I finished for him. And he looked back at me and I looked at him and our heads moved closer and closer together... and eventually, they met, and I felt his lips on mine, his arms wrapping themselves around me and I surrendered to the passionate embrace of my son..." />
