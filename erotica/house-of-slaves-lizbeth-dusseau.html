  <title>House of Slaves - Lizbeth Dusseau</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Sarah Strathorn thought she had the perfect Dominant submissive relationship with her husband, Alexander, until he turned his home into a house of slaves. He&#39;s a wealthy and powerful businessman who rules his world, and his wife, with an iron fist. Now, Sarah must compete with a bevy of beautiful female acquisitions, including Chloe who seems to have captured Alexander&#39;s heart as much as his sexually dominant desires.  Angry with this sudden change, Sarah strikes out on her own. She becomes the submissive lover to a renowned playwright Jeremy Loudon, then, filled with sexual guilt, she lets a casual acquaintance with a mysterious and domineering stranger turn into a torrid night of reprisal, punishment and sex. Sarah is further distraught when Jeremy demands she divorce her husband. She doesn&#39;t know where to turn, until she recalls the stranger&#39;s business card - Martin Finch, Attorney at Law. Seeking Martin&#39;s assistance, Sarah tells the man half-truths and tall tales, too embarrassed to disclose that she is as much a slave to Alexander as his other females in his house. She fails to tell him that ten years before she willingly gave her husband ultimate power over her life. In his mind she&#39;s no more than a piece of property to be used or discarded at will. When Alexander discovers her plans to divorce him, he swiftly acts, driving her to his feet again. Cruelly punished and forced to serve him and his slutty acquisitions, she finds her most depraved desires quickly resurrected. But the conniving Chloe has plans to destroy the current Mrs. Strathorn. Is it possible that with Alexander&#39;s connections in the underground slave trade, he would dare sell her? Or will he simply keep her slavishly serving in his house of slaves? She&#39;s been curtly dismissed by her lover, she&#39;s infuriated her attorney, and now any hope for rescue from this bed of thorns looks hopelessly bleak." />
