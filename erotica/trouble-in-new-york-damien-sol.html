  <title>Trouble in New York - Damien Sol</title>
      <meta name="description" content="DESCRIPTION:&lt;br /&gt;
With his time in Egypt over or so he thinks. The skyline of his birth place rose high above Andrew McCain. Little did he know the gods of old are not yet done with this newly awaken Pharaoh. Isis makes her appearance in Andrew&amp;#39;s life. How will new goddess upturn Andrew&amp;#39;s life? Why does it feel like she and all the others are trying to get Andrew to return to Egypt?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
EXCERPT:&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;You made it very hard Andrew,&amp;rdquo; Alex said, in a heated pout.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Oh?&amp;rdquo; Andrew smirked as his hands held onto his mother&amp;rsquo;s ass.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Mmmhmm,&amp;rdquo; Alex hummed feeling her son&amp;rsquo;s fingers slip beneath the hem of her shirt. Gooseflesh raced up her skin, her thighs trembled as her clit brushed against his bulge. Releasing a shuddering gasp as she tilted her head back as her son&amp;rsquo;s hands cradled her orbs. &amp;ldquo;Yes Andrew, I&amp;rsquo;ve missed you so much. You teasing me all day, driving me mad to the point of stripping out of my pants, bending over and saying: Fuck me!&amp;rdquo; Alex said, in a forceful, lust filled purr as she stared demonically at her son. Her tongue curled out tasting the lips of the man that made love to her. Her hips rocked faster as she dry humped her son. Right now she needed his cock. She needed to feel him back within the depths of her womanhood. Her eyes locked onto his, the conflagration of her willingness danced in the depths of her pupils,. The wickedness of those flames flared as her fingers slowly lowered Andrew&amp;rsquo;s zipper.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Andrew,&amp;rdquo; Alex panted heatedly as her hand held his cock against her mon Venus. Her shirt was draped open, offering Andrew passage into her temple.&amp;nbsp; Running her hand down his shaft as her hips rolled. Her hand pressed against the back of Andrew&amp;rsquo;s head, pressing her forehead against his, making him see the fires, he lights in her soul. Her breath danced in shuddering waves against his lips as her clit rolled along her son&amp;rsquo;s length.&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Yeah. Did you find something you wanted?&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Mmmhmm,&amp;rdquo; Alex purred as she rose to her knees. Drawing his gaze&amp;nbsp; down, her fingers eased the satin fabric to the side as she lined up her son with the entrance of her garden. &amp;ldquo;Watch baby, watch as mama fucks you,&amp;rdquo; she pleaded as her velvet tunnel parted allowing his rod of man entrance to her hot, lush valley. Alex loved the feel of her body underneath her son&amp;rsquo;s hands as those delicious waves started to build. Biting his lip as Andrew began to match her rhythm. Holding her son&amp;rsquo;s head against her left breast as his lips pressed softly and tightly around her areola. His tongue teased her nipple as her labia contoured to the shape of her son&amp;rsquo;s rod. Whimpering loudly as she felt her cream surging down her canal. She couldn&amp;rsquo;t scream, something she so wanted, she couldn&amp;rsquo;t alert anyone that she was riding her own son&amp;rsquo;s cock.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Alex&amp;rsquo;s thighs burned; her skin held a light sheen of sweat that coated it. Gently pushing Andrew onto his back. Her hands pressed down on his shoulders as she rocked her hips. Her folds gliding along that hard, thick pole of his. Making her mound realize what its missed.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Come on baby, give me that prize,&amp;rdquo; Alex huffed, noting the time. &amp;ldquo;I want to walk around the museum knowing that I have my son&amp;rsquo;s, my lover&amp;rsquo;s, cum deep inside of me. I want to feel it dripping onto my panties as I talk to Anta and Carla. Knowing how they would be jealous that I got you first. Such a naught boy you are, letting them paw at you in front of me." />
