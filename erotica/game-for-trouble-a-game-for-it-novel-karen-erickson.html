  <title>Game for Trouble (A Game for It Novel) - Karen Erickson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Willow Cavanaugh would be happy if she never saw cocky football star Nick Hamilton again. Sure, their fling was the hottest she&#39;d had, but he&#39;s way too much of a playboy to settle down with one woman. Plus, she&#39;s got her heart set on a piece of real estate for her catering business--and Nick owns that property. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Nick may be at the top of his game, but all he wants is a second chance with Willow. When he offers to sell her his commercial space if she agrees to a series of dates with him, their chemistry is so scintillating that jumping back into bed seems like an inevitability. But Willow&#39;s decided all&#39;s fair in sex and blackmail. Little does she know, Nick&#39;s playing to win...and she&#39;s the prize.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Each book in the Game for It series is a standalone story that can be enjoyed out of order. &lt;br&gt;Series Order:&lt;br&gt;Book #1 Game for Marriage&lt;br&gt;Book #2 Game for Trouble &lt;br&gt;Book #3 Game For Tonight&lt;/p&gt;" />
