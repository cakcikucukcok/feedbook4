  <title>The Horny Games Trilogy (Monster Gangbang Sex Erotica) - Jenna Powers</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Karen and Linda are sisters living in a world ravaged by war and destruction. The Labyrinth is a maze filled with horny monsters. Linda is selected as a contestant into the maze, but Karen offers herself instead. As Karen traverses the Labyrinth, she is met with enhanced monsters ready to plug every hole! Does Karen manage to make her way out or not? This book bundles the three Horny Games books.
The Horny Games
Warning! This explicit story contains sex with monsters and includes oral sex, anal licking, and vaginal sex.
Years ago, the world population reached its weak. In an effort to stem population, sex was disallowed and only certain areas were allowed to have sex. In its place was the Horny Games. A Labyrinth full of monsters that a woman from each area had to pass through. Whoever made it through would bring unlimited sex back to their area for a year.
Karen is the volunteer from her area, taking place of her sister Linda. Stuck in the Labyrinth full of man-made monsters, Karen and four other women try to battle their way to the exit. One wrong turn however and they are screwed... literally, by monsters.
The Horny Games 2: Fire Catching
Years ago, the world population reached its weak. In an effort to stem population, sex was disallowed and only certain areas were allowed to have sex. In its place was the Horny Games. A Labyrinth full of monsters that a woman from each area had to pass through. Whoever made it through would bring unlimited sex back to their area for a year.
Karen volunteered from her area, taking place of her sister Linda. Stuck in the Labyrinth full of man-made monsters, Karen battled her way to the exit. She was betrayed by the person she loved the most. In Fire Catching, the second book to the Horny Games, Karen manages to escape the Labyrinth, bringing about a push for change. The Government decides to change the rules at the next annual event, bringing back former winners. This places Karen right back into a new Labyrinth full of monsters and this time, tentacles, waiting to fill her up. Does this new version of the Games get Karen revenge?
Warning! This 10,769 word explicit story contains sex with monsters (dragons, goblins, centaurs and more) and tentacle sex with multiple women.
The Horny Games 3: Moaningjay
Karen quietly resides at the rebellion&#39;s headquarters as they plan for an attack against the Government. Her sister, Linda, devises and interesting plan to lure her out. Linda puts her own self up as the reward for Karen returning to the Capitol. President Ice promises that the Government will not harm her, but is that enough to lure Karen back towards the Labyrinth? Does the rebellion allow her?
With the President on thin ice, he takes a chance at giving up Linda for Karen. Linda has more devious plans after Karen returns, which could result in Karen ending up back in the Labyrinth against monsters or... even worse, possibly finishing her sister once and for all.
Warning! This 12,228 word story contains explicit, graphic sex scenes between women and four armed monsters, lizard men with multiple monstrous rods and light elements of BDSM.
It is highly recommended that the Horny Games and Fire Catching be read prior to reading the final book of the Horny Games, Moaningjay." />
