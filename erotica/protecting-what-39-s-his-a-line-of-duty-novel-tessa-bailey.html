  <title>Protecting What&#39;s His (A Line of Duty Novel) - Tessa Bailey</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The opportunity was just too damn delicious for Ginger Peet to pass up. The purse full of money she finds--$50,000 to be exact--could give her and her teen sister the new start they need. So she grabs the cash, her gothy sibling, and their life-sized statue of Dolly Parton, and blows outta Nashville in a cloud of dust. Chicago, here we come...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Turns out, Chicago has some pretty hot cops. Hot, intense, naughty-lookin&#39; cops like Derek Tyler, who looks like he could eat a girl up and leave her begging for more. And more. Tempting as he is, getting involved with the sexy homicide lieutenant next door poses a teensy problem for a gal who&#39;s on the lam. But one thing is certain--Derek&#39;s onto her, and he wants more than just a taste. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And as far as he&#39;s concerned, possession is nine-tenths of the law.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Each book in the Line of Duty series is STANDALONE:&lt;br&gt;* Protecting What&#39;s His&lt;br&gt;* Officer Off Limits&lt;br&gt;* Asking for Trouble&lt;br&gt;* Staking His Claim&lt;br&gt;* Protecting What&#39;s Theirs&lt;/p&gt;" />
