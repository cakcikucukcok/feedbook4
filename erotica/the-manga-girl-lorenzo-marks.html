  <title>The Manga Girl - Lorenzo Marks</title>
      <meta name="description" content="After inheriting a house, Nick advertises for a tenant to share his expenses - and along comes Lucy, an eccentric, outgoing, Japanese-American art student, with a passion for drawing manga cartoons. She is vivacious and sexy, and it isnt long before Nick succumbs to temptation and visits Lucys room - where he discovers that she has somewhat unusual and demanding sexual needs. Over the following weeks, Lucy lures Nick into her lascivious world of sexual role-play, and - reluctantly at first, but with ever-increasing enthusiasm - he eventually becomes her bondage master. Always full of surprises, Lucy spreads her carnal magic dust amongst Nicks close circle of friends and very soon, he becomes completely intoxicated by her. Every day is an adventure with Lucy, as Nicks previously chaste existence is transformed into one of bondage, spanking, cosplay, and, along with Lucys best friend Summer, wild threesome sex. Then Lucys psychotic ex-boyfriend - yakuza hit-man, Johnny Ho - unexpectedly arrives on the scene. When Lucy suddenly disappears, Nick traces her to Johnny Hos secluded up-state cabin, where he discovers she is being systematically tortured and sexually abused. Nick is then captured himself, and Johnny Ho forces him to participate in Lucys daily pain and humiliation sessions - in an attempt to break the love that binds them. Over the next few days, Nick and Lucys world descends into a dark routine of sexual torment and degradation. As Lucy gradually withdraws into herself, Nick realizes that time is running out, and that he must find a way out of their trap before he loses her forever." />
