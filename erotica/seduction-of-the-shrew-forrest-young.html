      <meta name="description" content="The holidays are coming…and so are Paige’s grandparents!
In this fifth entry of The Angel Falls Library Files, Brenda’s parents arrive for their annual week-long visit during the Christmas holiday. Adam and Brenda grudgingly assume that their incestuous activities will have to be curtailed. Paige, however, has different ideas…
Seeing an opportunity for long-held fantasies to be fulfilled, Paige knows that the key to it all is her sexy but very stodgy grandmother. If she can get her to fall, the rest will fall like dominoes.
~~~~~  Excerpt  ~~~~~
Phyllis avoided looking at her reflection in the bathroom mirror as she let the cool water trickle over her hands. She brought her cool moistened hands up to her cheeks in the hopes of washing away the confusion muddling her mind. For a moment she desperately tried to convince herself she just imagined the incident that just took place in the kitchen. But the echoes of his touch, his hand gently trailing down her back, his hand on her butt were shockingly undeniable.
He really did that! she thought to herself as she kept her eyes closed, still not daring a glance at her reflection. He actually squeezed my ass! My own son-in-law!
The act was unthinkable. Then the look of innocence and confusion on his face when she turned to confront him caused her to again wonder if it was all in her mind. But even if it was, what would possibly cause her to imagine such a thing?
Phyllis opened her eyes suddenly, and finally gazed wide-eyed into her reflection in the mirror. It wasn&#39;t her face she stared at, however, but rather she looked down at her chest. She was startled by the realization that her nipples were hard! Not just firm, but achingly hard!
She stared in relief to discover that the bra she was wearing was padded sufficiently enough to conceal the hardness of her nipples, but the fact that they were pressing firmly against the fabric could not be denied. Almost unconsciously, Phyllis brought her hands up to her breasts, as they were aching to be touched. Phyllis closed her eyes and held her breath as she gently waded in a sensation she had not experienced in years. A gentle squeeze relieved the ache in her breasts somewhat, yet on the other hand stirred a growing yearning for more.
Letting out a small gasp, Phyllis opened her eyes to be greeted by the image of her elderly self cradling her breasts. Her eyes widened in shock at the sight, her body tense in disbelief of the image displayed before her. Her gaze zeroed in on the diamond laced wedding band adorning her left hand, the sparkle seeming to wink at her lasciviously.
She removed her hands from her breasts quickly and steadied herself on the cold porcelain of the sink as she looked down, no longer being able to stand the sight looking at her in the mirror. What are you doing? she thought to herself in disgusting shock. You’re a married woman! A pillar of your community! Respected and admired in the highest of social circles. 
Yet the echo of Adam’s hand squeezing her ass shouted loudly through the deepest parts of her body, permeating her mind uncontrollably, almost consuming her.
Her own son-in-law, she thought.
Her own daughter&#39;s husband!" />
