  <title>Spellbound For Incest - Laura Lovecraft</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Emma and her son, Eric, moved in hopes of a new start and forgetting old pain. Instead they find a house with a history of strange things happening to families, specifically mothers and their sons. Emma doesn&amp;#39;t believe in ghosts or curses. But when she begins having incestuous dreams and forbidden desires she believe there are forces at work. Forces that have her spellbound...for incest!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
~~~~~ Excerpt ~~~~~&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Eric, I need you to get this off me.&amp;quot; She grabbed the chain and lifted the pendent off her chest. &amp;quot;I tried to take it off, but the clasp is stuck.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Really? It looks great on you.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Eric what color was this when you first saw it?&amp;quot;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Huh?&amp;quot; He blinked. &amp;quot;It was green of course.&amp;quot; He snapped his fingers. &amp;quot;No, wait, I think it was kind of light purplish.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;But its green now!&amp;quot; she said with more concern than she had intended.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Matches your eyes.&amp;quot; Eric nodded. &amp;quot;Maybe it&amp;#39;s like a mood stone.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Take it off me, now.&amp;quot; Emma tried to remain calm.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Okay.&amp;quot; Eric leaned closer and took the chain in his fingers.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
His right hand covered the pendent and Emma gasped when a wave of heat flowed through her. Simultaneously, Eric released a sharp breath and blinked several times as if he were confused. The warm sensation spread throughout her body and caused chest trailed through her and caused of a different kind of heat between her legs.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;This really does look good on you, mom.&amp;quot; Eric spoke softly and his eyes had a distant look in them. &amp;quot;It matches your gorgeous eyes.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;You like my eyes?&amp;quot; Her voice sounded different and she realized she was suddenly breathing heavy.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;They&amp;#39;re beautiful,&amp;quot; He gave her that sweet smile she&amp;#39;d barely seen in the last few months. &amp;quot;Just like the rest of you.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;You think your mother&amp;#39;s beautiful?&amp;quot; She surprised herself with a little girl like giggle. &amp;quot;Tell me more.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;I like your hair down.&amp;quot; He put his left hand in her hair and lightly ran his fingers through it. &amp;quot;You always wear it up, but I really like it like this.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
A shiver went through her as he played with her hair and like last night her nipples were so hard they were aching.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Maybe I&amp;#39;ll wear it down more,&amp;quot; She winked. &amp;quot;Just for my boy.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;You look so uptight with your hair up and the way you dress.&amp;quot; Eric continued to play with her hair. &amp;quot;But when its down it makes you look playful.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Playful?&amp;quot; Seemed like an odd term for a boy his age.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Yeah, and sexy.&amp;quot; His voice had lowered to a husky pitch and she noticed he was breathing harder. &amp;quot;Like this outfit.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
His hand left her hair and she swallowed hard when he put his palm on her bare chest just over the low neckline of the t-shirt.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Why?&amp;quot; She found herself looking forward to the response.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Because it shows you off. Shows how sexy you really are.&amp;quot; He gave her a sly smile as his eyes now fixed directly on her breasts.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Those shorts show off those long legs and your&amp;quot; He winked lasciviously. &amp;quot;Rear end, shall we say.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;You look at your mother&amp;#39;s ass?&amp;quot; She giggled again even as somewhere in her mind she told herself to shut the hell up.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;You&amp;#39;re a sexy woman, mom.&amp;quot; Eric told her, and leaned closer as he spoke. &amp;quot;I wasn&amp;#39;t kidding. A lot of my friends wanted you.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Did they now?&amp;quot; She stared into his eyes and saw a look in them that no son should ever give his mother." />
