Third Time&#39;s A Charm, is a wry and often funny and steamy fantasy paranormal short story about a man who is told to clean out the garbage from under his house. He discovers a whole lot of smelly trash bags and one old book of spells. Because he hasn&#39;t had a woman in a long time, he decides to conjure up one. The first time it doesn&#39;t really work out.   The Mummified Monkey&#39;s Paw is an occult story about a young man visiting a curio shop and finding a mummified monkey&#39;s paw, which creates a change in him that he could never have foreseen." />
