  <title>Demise of the Diva - Lizbeth Dusseau</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Patrick Penny Investigations - brainchild of intrepid lesbian P.I.s Leslie Patrick and Robin Penny - takes on a really hot case: the murder of the notorious Diva Felicia Roman. The circumstances of the crime lead the pair on an excursion through the leatherdyke underground, where motives--and desires--run deep. But as Leslie and Robin soon find, every woman harbors her own closely guarded secret... Can they free their jailed client, Betsy -- Felicia&#39;s last lover? She could be the killer... but so could Martha who&#39;s been topping the insatiable Diva... or Remy, Martha&#39;s jealous lover, or Zelda, their mysterious trampy friend, or even the intimidating leatherdyke Domme Jane Hugh, who may have the most to gain from Felicia&#39;s demise. While Leslie and Robin unravel the mystery at the Victorian mansion on Roman Hill, sexual feelings between these former lovers are rekindled. Suddenly Leslie finds herself profoundly attracted by the S&amp;M world that Robin loves -- the one she&#39;s so adamantly shunned.
