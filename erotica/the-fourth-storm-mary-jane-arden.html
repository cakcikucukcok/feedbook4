  <title>The Fourth Storm - Mary Jane Arden</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Racheal West, a guilt ridden young widow, is looking forward to beginning a new life in the isolated art community of Verateague. The quaint coastal town is already home to her best friend, Hoolie Daniels, as well as to the artistically gifted and sexually eccentric Gabriel family. But life is not going well in Verateague: the town is besieged by storms and an unsolvable murder that has everyone associated with the local art center (of which Racheal is the new director) targeted as a suspect. Racheal&#39;s new circle of friends include the last remaining members of Verateague&#39;s revered founding family: charismatic Brevet Gabriel, a man burdened by a celebrated artistic heritage; his half-sister Jesse, a fading beauty tormented by dark family secrets; and Scot and Denny Caltrider, men from the wrong side of the Verateague tracks whose lives since boyhood have been inextricably intertwined with that of the Gabriel family. Racheal&#39;s new life is a confrontation of secrets from the past that continue to haunt the present dangerously.&lt;/p&gt; Read the book, wear the jewelry, visit the web site...&lt;i&gt;The Fourth Storm&lt;/i&gt; is not only an exciting novel but also the inspiration for the narrative jewelry designs of author/artist Mary Jane Arden. Narrative jewelry is a three-dimensional illustration to its companion short story. The narrative (which can take the form of a miniature storybook, letter, diary, entry, or postcard) reveals new facets in the lives of the characters from &lt;i&gt;The Fourth Storm&lt;/i&gt;.
