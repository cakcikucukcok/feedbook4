  <title>The Housewife And The Hitchhiker - Stephanie Gwladferth</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Kate is a student, hitching her way to Glastonbury in 1995. Julie is a newly separated housewife in her 40s, driving home. Against her better judgement, she picks Kate up and gets taken on a voyage of discovery that changes her life.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Note: This consists of two stories, one from Julie&amp;#39;s point of view and the other telling the same events from Kate&amp;#39;s point of view and extending the story a bit.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
~~~~~ Excerpt ~~~~~&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
...She took a sip of the wine. &amp;quot;What about you? Ever tried a walk on the wild side?&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;What? Oh, you mean have I ever, um, been with a woman. No&amp;quot; Julie took another sip of the wine to hide her nervousness. I thought I&amp;#39;d got over this, why is it coming back?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Never? Not even at school? Never practise&amp;#39; kissing with your best friend? Never go to your best friend&amp;#39;s house and compare the changes puberty was making to you both? Never spent the night spooning with a friend at a sleepover? I did all of those and whereas I was gay I&amp;#39;m pretty sure they weren&amp;#39;t&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Julie was sure her face was red as she answered. &amp;quot;No, I&amp;#39;ve never done anything like that&amp;quot; Though I do remember Cynthia at school talking about practising kissing with Emma. And I remember feeling jealous... She gulped some more wine to hide her discomfort. And why am I uncomfortable with this?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Well, if you want to see what you missed out on, I&amp;#39;m here.&amp;quot; Kate said with a smile and a seductive pout.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Heart pounding, Julie replied &amp;quot;I thought you said I was safe with you&amp;quot;, smiling and laughing nervously. Did she mean that? Do I want her to have meant it?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;I said that I wouldn&amp;#39;t do anything that you don&amp;#39;t want me to. And I meant it.&amp;quot; She reached over to put her wine glass down, moving closer as she did. &amp;quot;So, what do you want, Julie? Would you like me to kiss you?&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Oh God... &amp;quot;I...&amp;quot; What do I say? &amp;quot;I...&amp;quot; Julie couldn&amp;#39;t speak, her voice was paralysed with the thought of where this might lead. Where do I want this to lead? I&amp;#39;m not a lesbian and she&amp;#39;s my daughter&amp;#39;s age! Despite her thoughts, she became aware that her head had moved up and down in a barely perceptible nod.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Thought so.&amp;quot; said Kate and moved in towards her..." />
