  <title>Breaking Him In - Wilson Harbour</title>
      <meta name="description" content="DESCRIPTION:&lt;br /&gt;
Frank&amp;#39;s best friend had always desired to be with him, but for years had gone unsatisfied. That was until Frank&amp;#39;s son Mike turned eighteen and a man who had practically been like an uncle to Mike realized he could explore his unrequited passions about Frank with him instead. What better way to work out unresolved sexual frustrations than with the almost spitting image of Frank himself?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
EXCERPT:&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;I&amp;#39;ve never...&amp;rdquo; Mike started and gave a shocked gasp as my breath hit his small asshole, a tight, just turned legal opening for me to devour and then destroy. My tongue quickly followed, finding his hole with its wet tip and I slowly snaked it around it. Mike was crying out again into the cover, tensing up as his asshole clenched tight, but my tongue had worked the holes of many men, and I slowly licked around it until he started to loosen.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Oh my god...&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I was enjoying how he tasted, not letting up as I quietly fed on his ass. My hands could barely hold the cheeks and I could feel them slowly rest on either side of my face. I kept up a slow pace at first, circling my tongue one way and then the other as I licked around his asshole, then into the hole before making my way out to savor the deep sides of his bottom. I just held his mounds now, in a strong grip, letting my tongue run and rub along the tender, pink flesh that surrounded his little hole. I turned my head and repeated my actions, all before returning my attentions to his most sensitive area. All I could hear out of Mike was his muffled moans and cries into his cover. I bet his cock ached to be tended to but my focus was solely on this one part of him. My favorite part.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I kept up my sinful feast for some time. My tongue quicker as I teased and tasted the outer parts of him, and the I slowed it as I tortured that little ring of hot flesh. That seemed to drive him crazy and sent him into the occasional spasm. He even gave a muffled squeal or two. I attempted to slip him a finger but his ass fell onto the side of my face and in the way, so I only used my tongue to prep him. It would hurt a whole lot more I figured when I entered him but I wanted to feel his tight ass stretch around my thick tip, stretch from its clenched, unbroken form. Mike would definitely be a tight fit. The eighteen year old hunk was about to get opened the fuck up.&lt;br /&gt;
