      <meta name="description" content="Following an acrimonious divorce from her unfaithful husband Jack, the beautiful twenty-six year old Olivia Johnson becomes a powerful advocate for woman&#39;s equality. In the process, she makes an enemy of the millionaire womanizer, Sir Malcolm Bradbury. Humiliated by her public attacks, he wreaks his revenge by kidnapping young woman. After being sexually used by his henchmen, she&#39;s taken to Malcolm&#39;s mansion where she&#39;s branded with his mark, pierced, ringed and subjected to weeks of intense slave training. She&#39;s taught unquestioned obedience and absolute submission, her body and mind conditioned to accept her subjugation until she is no longer able or willing to resist the touch of her master&#39;s hand or the fiery bite of leather on her flesh. Even worse, she can do nothing to squelch the intense slave-heat that fills her belly. Malcolm will not stop her training until she&#39;s become the ultimate pleasure slave, at which point she&#39;ll be ready to sell to her new master. Dressed in a fine gown, Olivia attends a dinner-party, where she subjected to the naked and humiliating scrutiny of the master&#39;s guests. Spilled wine earns her a brutal beating, which sexually inflames the men and she&#39;s forced to submit to their multiple ravagings. However, when she sees true desire in the eyes of her rapist Alexander DeVere, she knows that this is one man to whom she would willingly give herself. She learns that DeVere has offered to buy her from Malcolm, and this inspires a tiny flicker of hope. However, when she&#39;s locked in a wooden truck and shipped off, she&#39;s horrified to discover that she&#39;s been sent to her ex-husband and his lover, Lady Honoria. For one week, she&#39;ll be their slave. But will that week be the end of the humiliating surrender to Jack? Olivia&#39;s fate remains in the hands of Malcolm Bradbury. Will he sell her to her ex, to DeVere, or keep her as his own passion slave?" />
