  <title>Ravenous Obsession - James Lucien</title>
      <meta name="description" content="DESCRIPTION
Ravenous Obsession is a supernatural-horror erotica novella. A tale of predatory desire and incestuous lust. A brawny werewolf infatuated with his younger human sister gives into his long-gestating sexual impulses and hunts her through the dark woods. Unfortunately, he isn’t the only one seeking her virginity under the full moon.
EXCERPT
Today is my baby sister’s eighteenth birthday. The party’s winding down now, everyone saying their goodbyes, Rosaleen thanking them for her gifts, as the sun is setting and the moon is rising. A full moon.
Rosaleen is dressed up for the occasion, and looks absolutely delicious, wearing a pink backless halter short-dress that flaunts her supple but tight, petite body, with white thigh-high stockings and heels that showcase her silky, slender legs. The tight-fitting fabric is thin enough that in the right light I can see the strap of her black thong beneath, as well as the outline of her tiny nipples. She isn’t wearing a bra, as usual, a common and accepted practice in these rural parts. Her wavy brunet hair reaches all the way down her bare back and sways back and forth as she walks, revealing the smooth skin behind, and teasing me with peeks at the sexy dimples of her lower back. When she smiles her beautiful chocolate eyes, specked with emerald, seem to sparkle. Her pouty, plump lips are glossed pink to match her elegant dress. I wanna taste them so badly my loins ache.
I’ve eagerly awaited this night for so long. Ever since I caught the scent of her first bleed when she turned twelve, I’ve been fighting potent urges, which I’ve kept to myself. I’ve watched her slowly bloom into a woman for the last six years, secretly gawking as her budding breasts grew into heavy bosoms, and her little soap-bubble plumped into a heart-shaped rump. I’ve been stealing her dirty panties for just as long, relishing the succulent scent of her nether regions as I abused myself while fantasizing about caressing her little, lithesome body, so firm from chopping wood and her other country chores. She hasn’t a clue that my love for her goes beyond normal sibling fondness. If she did she wouldn’t prance around in her skimpy nightgowns, have me rub oil over her when tanning by the pool, cuddle so closely during scary movies, or give me such long affectionate hugs goodnight, all of which cause me to wear tight boxer-briefs and jeans to hide the resulting erections.
And now that she’s of age by Were law, I can’t resist these powerful compulsions any longer. I must claim her as my own before someone else deflowers her. I will take her virginity by force, turn her under the full moon, and then she will be my pack mate, bound to me for life.
The monthly hunt is tonight. Our father, the pack leader, will be leading the hunt with our mother by his side as always. I plan to use sudden stomach cramps, something I ate maybe, as an excuse to skip the hunt. And so I will have my sister all to myself until the sun rises." />
