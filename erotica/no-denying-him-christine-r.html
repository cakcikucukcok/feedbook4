  <title>No Denying Him - Christine R.</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;LJ:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is it possible to love someone as much as you hate them? I didn&#39;t know the answer to that question until our paths crossed unexpectedly one summer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How the fuck was I supposed to know she&#39;d be there, and why the hell wasn&#39;t I warned in advance? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I never intended to fall in love. The only feeling of love I ever felt was simply a sensation. Definitely not heartfelt love, but love from the immense pleasure I received while I took what I wanted from the women I fucked.  I was wealthy, good-looking, a firecracker between the sheets, and one of Michigan&#39;s most eligible bachelors. The last thing I expected was to meet and fall for an obstinate younger woman who would forever change my life in the worst and in the best of ways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lennon:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My life was just fine before I met the filthy-mouthed, vulgar, arrogant, possessive and overbearing, LJ Gresham. I never shouldve gone on that vacation. If I hadnt, I couldve saved myself a boatload of heartache. However, if Id stayed home like I shouldve, I wouldve missed out on the best sexual experiences of my life, and I never wouldve met the man who turned my world upside down every time we were together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we werent fucking, we were fighting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eventually, we discovered we loved one another, but we hated each other even more. Would earth- shattering sex be enough to hold us together, or would it tear us apart? What can I say? Our love-hate relationship shouldve separated us from the beginning, but to my surprise, it only made us stronger. &lt;/p&gt;" />
