  <title>The Mantantra Letters - Nathan James, Victor Bliss</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Philosophy or Pornography?&lt;BR&gt;  
Two radical thinkers tackle the fundamental problems of passion between men and its relationship to spirituality.  In a vibrant, erudite, and candid correspondence that spans the 1990s, these two old friends from Oxford explore how the ancient mysticism of Tantra can work in todays world to bring about the transformation of sexual ecstasy into Self-realization. The writers are equally passionate about shadowy issues that are largely disowned by the mainstream and the gay community: sexual compulsion, self-condemnation, perversion, addiction, self-destruction, jealousy, and possessiveness. Drawing on their own raw personal experience and intense reflection, they use the philosophy and practice of Tantra to probe these enigmas and discover the highest purposes of their sexuality.
&lt;BR&gt;
&lt;P&gt; a revolutionary book . a must read for anyone, man AND woman, interested in spiritual awakening through the conscious cultivation of sexual ecstasy.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;--Margot Anand, &lt;I&gt;The Art of Sexual Ecstasy&lt;/I&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;BR&gt;
&lt;BR&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;B&gt;VICTOR BLISS&lt;/B&gt; is an American who studied Comparative Religion and Philosophy 
at Harvard, Oxford, and the Sorbonne, and Psychotherapy at the Jung Institute 
in Zurich.  Since 1965 he has studied and practiced Tantra under several 
masters in India and the West.  Based in California, he has a private 
practice, teaches seminars and leads workshops in America, Europe, and Asia. 
Victor Bliss has long been a philosophical critic of the anti-sexual 
prejudice of the Christian tradition.  In view of the recent pedophilia 
crises in the Catholic Church, Bliss is active in initiating a new kind of 
critique and dialogue about spirituality and sexuality in the Christian 
tradition.&lt;/P&gt;

Open Letter to the Pope&quot; and &quot;The New 95 Theses&quot;: http://hometown.aol.com/victorblissmail/myhomepage/business.html&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;B&gt;NATHAN JAMES&lt;/B&gt; was born in London. Educated at Oxford and the University of 
California, Berkeley, he received his PhD for a dissertation on homoerotic 
desire in the context of Freudian psychoanalysis. He currently lives in 
Paris, where he works as an art critic, therapist, and kickboxing coach.&lt;/P&gt;
