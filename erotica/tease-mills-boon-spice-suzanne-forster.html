  <title>Tease (Mills &amp; Boon Spice) - Suzanne Forster</title>

          &lt;strong&gt;Tess Wakefield has cooled on sex. &lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Oh, she did the rebellious wild-child thing in college, making it a point to break all the rules —especially the ones about sex —and all it got her was a string of loser boyfriends and a fear of rashes. Underwhelmed by her experiences, she’s happy to focus on her career and leave her vibrator in storage.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Now an advertising exec, Tess has been hired by one of Madison Avenue’s hottest agencies as co-creative director with wunderkind Danny Gabriel. Secretly, she’s been asked to rein in his maverick style, and Tess immediately suspects Danny when someone sabotages her new campaign.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;But everyone in the place seems to have a secret agenda. It’s a cutthroat business, and not everyone is willing to play nice with the new girl. Including Danny. His early, fervent advances are a pleasant shock to Tess, but she never imagines for a second that she’d allow him to draw her into the dark heart of the most breathtaking erotic S&amp;M club in Manhattan —or that she’d be so willing to give up control and like it.&lt;/p&gt;
