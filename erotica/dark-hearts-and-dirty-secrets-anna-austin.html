  <title>Dark Hearts And Dirty Secrets - Anna Austin</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Behind the facade of piety and respectability, the true face of Victorian England was rather more&amp;hellip;dirty. In these three kinky, sexy, twisted tales, submission is demanded and innocence is despoiled. Are you ready to see the Dark Hearts and Dirty Secrets of the Victorian Age?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Story One: Hunted in the Woods and Taken&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
When Lord De Vere catches Alice stealing from him, she expects him to discipline her. But the punishment he inflicts on her is more twisted and debauched than innocent Alice could ever imagine. She is released into the woods - and then Lord De Vere and his men hunt her down, like predators chasing prey.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Story Two: Amelia&amp;#39;s Punishment&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Amelia is a curious and adventurous young woman. Perhaps too curious. She should never have trespassed in the forbidden room. Should never have become so wantonly excited by the depraved painting and objects found within it. And now she must be punished.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Story Three: Taken at the Masquerade&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
For Eliza, the masked ball should be the fulfilment of all her fantasies. But within the hedge maze, danger lurks. Hunters, looking for their prey. Her. They intend to have her, and Eliza is too innocent to avoid their trap.&lt;br /&gt;
~~~~~ PG Excerpt ~~~~~&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Why did you need to steal this necklace? Do we not feed you well?&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;You feed me well, my lord&amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&amp;ldquo;Then why did you need this little piece? Were you going to sell it to the broker?&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;No, sir. I wanted to keep it for myself.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;And why is that?&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
Alice&amp;rsquo;s mouth was now painfully dry. &amp;ldquo;I wanted&amp;hellip; it was&amp;hellip; it&amp;rsquo;s very pretty, my lord&amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Mmm.&amp;rdquo; Her master looked her over. &amp;ldquo;You know, I can&amp;rsquo;t let you get away with this. It will set a bad example for the others.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
I looked at him again. She couldn&amp;rsquo;t be thrown out of the estate&amp;hellip;this was the only life she had ever known! There wasn&amp;rsquo;t a way she could fend for herself in the real world, not without a reference. And it was far more likely that Lord De Vere would make sure that all the neighbouring gentry knew that she was a thief. She would never find another job.&lt;br /&gt;
Unless of course, she turned to the one profession that accepted disgraced maidservants with open arms. Whores. She had seen them at the local tavern, looking for trade. But the thought of that life filled her with despair, and her eyes suddenly filled with hot tears.&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;No, please sir! Don&amp;rsquo;t exile me, I&amp;rsquo;ll never survive!&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp;There followed a deadly silence in the room as her master thought of what to do next. Then there was a wicked grin that spread itself across his face. &amp;ldquo;I don&amp;rsquo;t HAVE to exile you&amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo; She smiled wondrously. &amp;ldquo;However, I will still need to punish you in another fashion.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Anything, sir! Anything!&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
His smile vanished. &amp;ldquo;As you&amp;rsquo;ll have it. You will meet me at the entrance to the estate woods on the morrow.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Sir?&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;You&amp;rsquo;ll see then.&amp;rdquo;" />
