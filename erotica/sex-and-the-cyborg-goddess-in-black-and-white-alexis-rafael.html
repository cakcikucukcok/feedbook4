  <title>Sex and the Cyborg Goddess: In Black and White - Alexis Rafael</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sex and the Cyborg Goddess&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;is a novel about Ana Fried, who arrives at Yale brimming with self-confidence just as it&amp;rsquo;s going co-ed. It&amp;rsquo;s 1969 (-- the same year Hillary Clinton entered Yale Law). Straight outta Scarsdale, Ana has the beauty and brains to make it big. But Ana&amp;rsquo;s an idiot when in comes to men. Believing in sexual freedom, she keeps a modern-day pillow book about her Yale lovers until her professor torches her writing in front of the class. In an era of Black Panther rallies and anti-Vietnam protests, Ana joins forces with an African-American classmate named Diane to address the racism and sexism of society and Yale. But when sexual assault upstages Ana&amp;rsquo;s graduation, she hits the road in a beat-up Chevy, hoping to find Diane, who has since dropped out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Down South, while documenting the blues, Ana meets a musician who&amp;rsquo;s the polar opposite of what would please her social-climbing mother. She makes beautiful music with Andy until he&amp;rsquo;s arrested for drugs. She flees to California, then Germany, New York, and India, struggling to break the glass ceiling as a filmmaker while fighting her addiction to loving the wrong men. Unable to keep a day job or a man, she escapes to India, hoping for spiritual transcendence. In her backpack is a camera to film the goddesses of India. She&amp;rsquo;s finally determined to break through as a filmmaker on her own.&lt;/p&gt;" />
