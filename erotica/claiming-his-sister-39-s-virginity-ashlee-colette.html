  <title>Claiming His Sister&#39;s Virginity - Ashlee Colette</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;b&gt;DESCRIPTION:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Warner has spent the past year fantasizing about his beautiful, innocent sister. When they&amp;rsquo;re home for Spring Break, Madison confronts him about his odd behavior and he confesses his dark secret: He wants her. He&amp;rsquo;s desperate for her in a way he&amp;rsquo;s never been for any other girl. How will Madison react when she learns her brother yearns for her virgin pussy? Will she be disgusted by his confession or will she fulfill his every forbidden desire?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;EXCERPT:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Warner could swear he stopped breathing at her words. Madison raised her chin to meet his eyes and his heart began to pound so hard he thought his chest might explode. &amp;ldquo;What are you saying?&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Madison slowly slid the hand that, up until now had been holding his, up his arm. Her touch sent sparks of electricity through him, making it feel like his skin was on fire. Her gaze remained locked with his the whole time.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
In a flash, Warner pulled her to her feet and crushed her body against his chest, his lips crashing into hers. Her startled gasp gave him the chance to slide his tongue into her mouth. He kissed her senseless, his warm hands roaming over every inch of her body he could touch in that position. He could feel her bare breasts through her silky nightgown and when his hands palmed her ass, he could tell she was wearing a thong. The thought of what her ass would look like in that thong made him grunt into her mouth, his cock straining against his pants. He was so fucking hard just thinking about what he wanted to do to her.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Warner slid the robe off her shoulders as he walked them the few steps to her bed. He was careful not to put too much of his weight on her as he eased her down, her back sinking into the mattress as he settled on top of her...&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
...Madison broke the kiss, the need to come up for air overwhelming her. Warner rested his forehead against hers as they both caught their breath. He was just about to kiss her again when Madison&amp;rsquo;s hands tensed against his chest. She pushed at him to hold him off. &amp;ldquo;Wait.&amp;rdquo; She was panting so hard she had to take a moment before she could speak again. &amp;ldquo;We shouldn&amp;rsquo;t do this.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Her words felt like someone dumped freezing cold water over his head and slapped him at the same time. Warner&amp;rsquo;s voice was dangerously harsh when he finally spoke. &amp;ldquo;What did you say?&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Madison shook her head. &amp;ldquo;You were right before. We shouldn&amp;rsquo;t be doing this. This is&amp;mdash;&amp;rdquo; Madison swallowed down the lump in her throat as she saw the fire in his eyes. &amp;ldquo;This is wrong, brother.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;No, it isn&amp;rsquo;t,&amp;rdquo; Warner said, his voice steady as he reached up and cupped her cheek. &amp;ldquo;If this was wrong, you wouldn&amp;rsquo;t shiver every time I touch you.&amp;rdquo; He ran his fingers over her jawline to demonstrate his point and her body reacted accordingly. &amp;ldquo;Your hands wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be shaking against my chest. Your eyes wouldn&amp;rsquo;t keep flicking down to my cock and you wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be biting your lip at the sight of how hard I am for you.&amp;rdquo; Warner used his thumb to pull her bottom lip away from her teeth. He tilted her chin up until she met his gaze. &amp;ldquo;You want me as much as I want you. And we wouldn&amp;rsquo;t want each other so badly if this was wrong.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Before Madison could voice another thought, Warner&amp;rsquo;s mouth descended on hers, one of his hands groping her breast while the other worked its way down her stomach. He could feel her trying to push him away again, but there wasn&amp;rsquo;t much effort behind the action. Madison gasped as his hand slid under her nightgown, coming to rest between her legs." />
