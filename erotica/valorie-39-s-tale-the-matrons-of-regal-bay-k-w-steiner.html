  <title>Valorie&#39;s Tale: The Matrons of Regal Bay - K.W. Steiner</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;b&gt;DESCRIPTION:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
When Valorie Spencer and her husband Daniel decided to finally take that long-planned but never-realized Mediterranean cruise, she never thought that she&amp;rsquo;d end up cheating on him after nearly thirty years of marriage. When Daniel had suggested their son Austin join them before he left to study a South Pacific volcano, Valorie had no idea how that simple invitation would change her life forever.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;EXCERPT:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Quickly, and before she could second-guess herself, Valorie straddled Austin&amp;rsquo;s hips, facing away from him however. She didn&amp;rsquo;t want to look at him, to see who it was that she was mating with. She was ready to do this, to commit incest, but she needed a barrier still. Otherwise, she might back out, and the hunger that was deep inside her belly needed to be fed. Valorie felt his cock twitch in her grip, her son as excited as she was for what was about to take place. He was looking at her, but only at her back, the back of her head, and her ass. That barrier of recognition was in place for him as well.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Valorie paused briefly, holding Austin&amp;rsquo;s cock upright as she poised above him. His hands went to her ass and began to caress her cheeks as she readied herself to take the plunge. For a moment, both Austin and Valorie thought that she&amp;rsquo;d back out, but then she felt his tip align with her entry, and without another thought, she let herself drop. Austin&amp;rsquo;s cockhead wedged open her labia, and then her vagina, and popped through the entry. Her hips dropped quickly as his cock raced up her chute, and when her butt settled onto his lower belly, both she and her son knew that it was done. He was fully embedded within her now. Son inside mother once again, for the first time since he was born. Valorie sat bolt upright on her son&amp;rsquo;s manhood, feeling every inch of his hot-steel cock with her sensitive vaginal walls. She threw her head back and from deep, deep in her chest, she began to wail.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Aaaaannngggghhhhh!&amp;rdquo; she cried. The orgasm hit her with a mighty blow, a gut punch, that blew her mind, body, and soul. Every inch of her body began to vibrate and her vagina erupted. She felt her juices gushing out of her, jetting out to splash across Austin&amp;rsquo;s balls. She dipped a hand into her crotch and felt the hot cream pouring out of her and she began to rub in into her sex-flesh, his balls, and then up to her lips. She tasted herself on her fingers, and then ran her hand back to her clit, to attack the rack-hard bud as she began to move atop her son, fucking him, for the first time. This moment, the moment Austin returned to his mother&amp;rsquo;s warm and welcoming body, would never be lost in their memories." />
