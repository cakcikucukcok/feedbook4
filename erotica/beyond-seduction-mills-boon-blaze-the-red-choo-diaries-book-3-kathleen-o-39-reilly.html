          &lt;strong&gt;Sex didn&#39;t scare her… &lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Despite the success of her sultry Red Choo sex blog, it would take serious buzz to put Mercedes Brooks&#39;s first book of erotic fantasies on the bestseller list. And that meant agreeing to another showdown with her nemesis, the super-sexy TV pundit Sam Porter. This thing beyond seduction did.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;This time, though, the on-air innuendos were just a dress rehearsal. What happened later between the sheets was actually the main event. If the tabloids got wind of their night together, Sam&#39;s career would self-destruct. But the real shocker was that even with a prime-time scandal hanging over their heads, one night was not enough!&lt;/p&gt;
