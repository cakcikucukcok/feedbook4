  <title>Elevator Pitch (Interracial Black MM/White F Erotic Story) - Jane Snow</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Sara has quite a difficult interview and sadly boards an elevator, knowing that she most likely didn&#39;t get the job.  Two well dressed black men board with her and she recognizes them as the men she spoke to before she interviewed.  They try to reassure her and ask her if she had an elevator pitch.
She let&#39;s them know that she probably failed the interview with it and doesn&#39;t want to tell them.  They try to cheer her up, when the elevator suddenly comes to a halt.  As time goes on, the two ask for her pitch again.  When she still hesitates, they begin to open up.
One of them has been having dating problems.  The tables turn as Sara tries to console him.  When she learns more about his problems, she&#39;s stunned.  Apparently it&#39;s because he&#39;s too big for most women.  Sara rolls her eyes and informs him that it&#39;s the most ridiculous thing she&#39;s heard.  The two make a deal, her elevator pitch for proof that he&#39;s &quot;too large&quot; for most women.  Does Sara end up believing his story?
