  <title>Bikini Babes&#39; Carwash - Suzie McLean</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Phoebe thinks starting up a new hands-on carwash staffed entirely by her superbly stacked, gorgeous sorority sisters is a magnificent idea. Little does she know how that decision will change all their lives as, one after another, they meet and fall in love with the men of their wildest dreams...while trying to solve the mystery of a 20-year-old jewel heist!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Phoebe&amp;#39;s Desire&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Phoebe is confident that her new carwash will be a success. But Riley Thompson is a clever businessman. If the girls can&amp;rsquo;t afford to lease his prime location, he knows of other ways to make a tidy profit. Besides, he lusts after pretty Phoebe, and longs to teach her that an experienced older man can be an even better lover than a lusty football jock!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Antonia&amp;#39;s Arousal&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Toni has more worries on her plate than she cares to count. Their battered old carwash is in even worse shape than they thought, and the county&amp;rsquo;s new building inspector has showed up unexpectedly, and brought trouble with him. If only he wasn&amp;rsquo;t so incredibly sexy, with a taste for homemade Italian cooking&amp;hellip;and gorgeous Italian sorority girls!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Muriel&amp;#39;s Passion&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The rugged day laborer who&amp;rsquo;s joined their small crew seems disturbingly familiar. Even though Muriel aches to feel his clever hands gliding all over her body, something about him is making her keen senses hum with alarm.

Or is a job the only thing he wants?

Now he&amp;rsquo;s back&amp;mdash;and even the thought of seeing him again can reduce her to a mindless panic.
