  <title>Being Wicked - Lacy Danes</title>
      <meta name="description" content="It is an evening for rakes and rogues, courtesans and demimondes, and lords and ladies in disguise, all wishing to sample the array of erotic delights around them. But this ball is not the talk of the ton, it is a taste of forbidden ecstasy.  .  .&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Willful Surrender&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Lilly had never dreamed that hiding in her brother&#39;s carriage would end in her arrival at a ball such as this.  She should be shocked by the bawdy behavior before her, but instead she is intrigued. And when Vincent St. Jerome, London&#39;s foremost rake, offers to help her find her brother, she follows him to a room filled with peep holes in the walls. What Lilly sees is pure carnal pleasure and all she desires is complete sexual surrender.  .  .&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Willing Seduction&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Lady Wentland is a worldly widow who misses the sensual delights she used to share with her husband.  So attending the Cyprian&#39;s Ball disguised as a courtesan allows her to sample the erotic pleasures she&#39;s missed--until she meets Winston Greyton, her brother&#39;s best friend and the one man she knows she might have once loved. She resists his first advances toward her--but the heat of their arousal soon ignites a fire of wicked, reckless passion.  .  .&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Praise for Lacy Danes and What She Craves.  .  .&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&quot;Surpassed my expectations.  .  .Danes has turned up the heat to make these stories truly blazing.&quot;&lt;br&gt;--&lt;i&gt;Just Erotic Romance Reviews&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&quot;Danes&#39;s debut effort is definitely what readers crave!
