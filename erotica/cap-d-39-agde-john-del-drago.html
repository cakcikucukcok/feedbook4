  <title>CAP D&#39;AGDE - John del Drago</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Davide del Drago is a normal boy, born into a good family with great fortune and noble titles. Of average intelligence and above average weight, he has no natural affection, and his family is troubled even in the best of times. And so he decides to escape the gilded cage of his youth in a variety of colorful ways.  He makes his way through the world with acquaintances and friends, finding trouble and rebelling against his parents&#39; demands. Along the way, through ups, downs, highs and lows, he begins to discover himself-his needs and desires, as well as those of others-and to understand the world around him more clearly. Eventually he finds himself in a town called Cap d&#39;Agde, on the southern coast of France, where sits one of the best well-known naturist villages in the world. There, he learns what it truly means to be free.  In this erotic novel, a young man of privileged background gains self-knowledge through a range of experiences both mundane and wild." />
