  <title>Doctor&#39;s Experiment - Daisy Rose</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Innocent and naive Anna isn&amp;#39;t at all prepared when she starts creaming despite having never experienced carnal pleasures of any sort.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Panicked, she makes an appointment with her doctor, a sexy, intelligent older alpha male who is determined to help her with her problem...in every way possible.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
She is utterly unprepared for the onslaught of raw physical desire that consumes her.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
~~~~~ Excerpt ~~~~~&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Oh! I can&amp;#39;t be pregnant,&amp;quot; I said, more upset now. Discreetly, I wiped away a tear from my eye. I shouldn&amp;#39;t be crying. Crying solved nothing. That was my first fear, that I would be carrying the next reincarnate or something, but I peed on the testing stick - well, three testing sticks and they all came back with just a single line. I wasn&amp;#39;t pregnant. At least I had that going for me.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I was stunned when I felt his fingers on my chin, slowly lifting my face to look into his eyes. &amp;quot;We&amp;#39;ll solve this, Anna. No need for tears.&amp;quot; Gently, he brushed away the tears spilling from my eyes and I drew in a deep shuddering breath as I gazed into his perfect emerald eyes. His fingers on my chin was warm and comforting.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
We looked at each other for what felt like an eternity, then he quickly released me and looked away, as if realizing how unprofessional he was being. I took the opportunity to catch my breath again.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Since it&amp;#39;s not pregnancy, then I would say it&amp;#39;s hormonal,&amp;quot; he said, clearing his throat.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Hormonal?&amp;quot; I echoed, more to fill the silence than in confusion. I knew enough about science to understand what hormones were.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Lactation is caused by hormones in the body anyways. Perhaps your body thinks you&amp;#39;re pregnant. Do you touch yourself?&amp;quot; He must&amp;#39;ve seen the look of indignant surprise on my face, because he quickly explained. &amp;quot;This is important and purely professional, Anna.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I didn&amp;#39;t know if it was the way he said my name, or the authoritative tone in his voice, but I believed him. I shook my head. &amp;quot;I don&amp;#39;t.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Surely just a little bit? It&amp;#39;s perfectly fine to masturbate,&amp;quot; he said in disbelief.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;I don&amp;#39;t have time to do any of that,&amp;quot; I admitted. &amp;quot;I still trying to finish my degree full time while finding a job, Doctor Lee,&amp;quot; I admitted.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;You&amp;#39;re a student?&amp;quot; he asked, curiosity piqued now.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Yeah. Final year in business,&amp;quot; I said. &amp;quot;With a minor in art and design.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;I thought you said you were going to work?&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Busted. &amp;quot;An audition,&amp;quot; I felt my ears reddening from being caught in a lie.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Oh,&amp;quot; he smiled. &amp;quot;We can&amp;#39;t have you lactating during your audition now, can we?&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;No, Doctor,&amp;quot; I murmured. &amp;quot;That&amp;#39;s why I&amp;#39;m here. I&amp;#39;m hoping you have some temporary fix for this...&amp;quot;" />
