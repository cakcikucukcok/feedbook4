      <meta name="description" content="After voyeuristically witnessing another woman&amp;#39;s intensely hot marital indiscretion with another man, Jenni and JR&amp;#39;s lives would never be the same.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Jenni&amp;#39;s opinion of what sex between partners should be like took a dramatic turn, which left JR questioning his ability to perform to her new expectations.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
~~~~~ PG Excerpt ~~~~~&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
As we wandered around the grounds of the house we decided to fantasize a bit and pretended like it was our own home.&amp;nbsp; We were taking full advantage of the free alcohol and hors d&amp;#39;oeuvres as we were having a great time snooping around.&amp;nbsp; Jenni started becoming very friendly and flirtatious with others but that is normal when she is drinking.&amp;nbsp; This is when I noticed that Jenni was getting pretty wasted.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
We went from room to room and floor to floor checking out the entire place saying how we needed to redecorate and throwing our ideas at each other.&amp;nbsp; Then when we were on the third floor we heard a couple giggling as they made their way into one of the bedrooms.&amp;nbsp; Jenni&amp;#39;s drunken curiosity got her so she dragged me down the hall and listened by the door.&amp;nbsp; We listened and giggled ourselves for a while and that is when Jenni grabbed my package and said she wanted to see who it was.&amp;nbsp; I was like, &amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m not going to walk in there.&amp;quot;&amp;nbsp; She said, &amp;quot;Come On!!&amp;nbsp; Just walk in and pretend we didn&amp;#39;t hear them.&amp;quot;&amp;nbsp; It was a good idea but I chickened out because I had a better idea.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Let&amp;#39;s go find a way to the balcony.&amp;nbsp; I think these rooms are all connected by one.&amp;quot;&amp;nbsp; She smiled, giggled and ran into the next room.&amp;nbsp; We quietly opened the sliding glass door and we went onto the balcony.&amp;nbsp; The balcony was facing the front of the house so no one could see us up there as most of the party was in the back yard and inside.&amp;nbsp; We snuck over to the next sliding glass door and peeked in.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
We saw a girl doing a strip tease for a guy lying on the bed with his shirt already off.&amp;nbsp; The girl was a petite little thing with long wavy blonde hair and she was wearing a tight fitting white blouse, black knee length pencil skirt, black nylons and what had to be 5&amp;quot; black heels.&amp;nbsp; We laughed at first because the girl was so drunk that she was stumbling around while trying to dance for the guy.&amp;nbsp; She was so ripped that when she kicked off her shoes she knocked over a lamp.&amp;nbsp; Jenni and I were cracking up as quietly as possible but this was entertaining as hell.&amp;nbsp; Even the guy was cracking up watching her.&amp;nbsp; But then things got very interesting.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
After she gave up trying to pick up the lamp she just jumped on the bed and straddled him.&amp;nbsp; They started making out for a while and then quickly sat up.&amp;nbsp; She stepped off of the bed and stood in front of him with her back facing us and then she knelt down on the floor.&amp;nbsp; He then sat up and positioned himself near the edge.&amp;nbsp; They quickly removed his belt and undid his pants and soon you could tell by his face and her motions that he was now getting some attention.&amp;nbsp; Jenni said out load, &amp;quot;Holy Hell!!&amp;quot;&amp;nbsp; I grabbed and covered her mouth to keep her quiet and she pushed my hand away and giggled in amazement." />
