  <title>Slaves of the Black Magician - Commander James Bondage</title>
      <meta name="description" content="For centuries, the Kingdom of Seabourne offered its two loveliest maidens as tribute to the Black Magician Alaric. When Alaric takes Princess Ellyx as tribute, the warrior-mage Kayrene goes to rescue her friend. But Kayrene loses her contest with the Magician, and becomes his sex slave with Ellyx. Now, their only hope of rescue depends on a friendly demon named Malphus.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
~~~~~ PG Excerpt ~~~~~&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
One lovely summer morning, while the Princess was picking wildflowers on a hilltop meadow, she and her guards were set upon without warning. From out of a low cloud emerged&amp;nbsp; a flying, eight-sided pagoda. Eight doors flew open as one, and out of them came&amp;nbsp; ropes that fell to the ground among the Princess&amp;#39;s bodyguard, followed almost instantly by armed men sliding down the ropes to land among the Princess&amp;#39;s men. Before the astonished bodyguards could react to this imaginatively conceived ambush, they were all either slain or disabled. The raiders quickly seized Ellyx, tied and gagged her and were tying her to ropes from above, in preparation for hauling her aloft into the pagoda, when they were interrupted.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Suddenly, seemingly out of nowhere, a figure appeared. The newcomer looked at first glance to be a peasant lad of perhaps thirteen summers, with short-cropped yellow hair and green eyes, and clad in breeches and a brown smock of homespun.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Stay you there, villains!&amp;quot; the lad cried in a high, clear voice, raising his arm and holding up his hand, palm outward. &amp;quot;Release the Princess at once, lest you pay with your lives for your presumption,&amp;quot; he declared. &amp;quot;You may consider this your one and only warning.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The men momentarily stared in surprise at this apparition, for they had seen no-one other than the Princess&amp;#39;s party for miles in any direction before beginning their attack. Then they broke out in laughter. The leader of the kidnappers, a burly man with a thick brown beard, hefted his spear, and said, &amp;quot;You are a bold boy indeed, to so threaten a dozen grown men, veteran warriors all. You seem a comely lad, if a trifle delicate, and look as if you would give good sport, but our business permits not the time for the trial, so this warning I shall offer you: return to whatever hole you popped out of, Master Jack-in-the-Box, or it will go ill for you.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;No more boy than Jack-in-the Box am I,&amp;quot; answered the little blond. &amp;quot;As for your business, it must of necessity remain unfinished.&amp;quot; The newcomer traced a complicated figure in the air with an extended forefinger, while speaking strange words in a language that neither the kidnappers nor Princess Ellyx had ever before heard, and suddenly, the men were clutching at their own throats, as if fighting some invisible assailants, their faces turning red and rapidly darkening. In a short time, the raiders had all fallen to the ground, their complexions now purple from strangulation, and soon after that, they lay still and cold on the meadow, with dark bruises on their throats.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The short blonde girl (if girl she was as her words implied) strode up toward the Princess, heedless of the corpses that lay all around. &amp;quot;And there you have a lesson of great value,&amp;quot; she said, stopping briefly to address the now-deceased leader of the kidnapping party, with whom she had exchanged words. &amp;quot;Trust not over-much to appearances, for as you can see, they may lead you astray, to your considerable inconvenience. I am not, in truth, the good sport I may appear to be.&amp;quot; The soldier made no reply, but remained unmoving on his back, staring sightlessly up at nothing." />
