  <title>The Filly - Paul Moore</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&quot;Morgan enjoyed her glory days as a high school track star, until her brother&#39;s illness forced her to quit school and take a job as a barmaid. Her dreams seem to be over, but a mysterious stranger offers her a fortune to race for him. However, he&#39;s not interested in a typical track and field competition. He intends to have her trained and groomed as a ponygirl. First she must spend a month in preparation at his ranch, where a lesbian cowgirl and her team of handlers use bondage, corporeal punishment, and sexual seduction to train pony girls for competition. A cold and impersonal doctor, an imperious cowgirl trainer and a stiff punishment await her on the first day! The hard treatment she&#39;ll suffer is only bound to get worse. From the very start, it appears the feisty Morgan is not about to have an easy ride at the Bar-S Ranch. While Morgan believes she understands the risks involved, and is willing to continue for the money she&#39;ll earn, there are powerful conflicts brewing at the ranch: greed, envy, deception, and betrayal. She will be betting her future and freedom on the outcome of her first race. A tale of male and female domination of submissive females.  &quot;&quot;The cowgirl outfit should have tipped her off right away, Morgan realized, but it was too dusty and worn to be mere costume. This cowgirl wasn&#39;t assuming a role just to play the butch. The hand between Morgan&#39;s legs was knowing and skilled in the art of pleasure, but it was a hand callused from the real work of ranching and familiar with the ways of rope and leather. Just looking at her, Morgan sensed that this cowgirl could ride hard, lasso a maverick, or gentle a fractious mount. Morgan knew without having seen it that there would be a bullwhip hanging beside the cowgirl&#39;s bunk.&quot;&quot; &quot;" />
