But when they&#39;re forced together at their friends&#39; posh destination wedding, one thing is clear--Reed wants Julie more than he wants his next breath. Which is why he&#39;s not about to stand by when she&#39;s dared to seduce another man. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Julie wants neat, tidy sex, so she could get back to what she does best--making everybody &lt;i&gt;else&lt;/i&gt; happy.
