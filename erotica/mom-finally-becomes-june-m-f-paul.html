  <title>Mom Finally Becomes June - M.F. Paul</title>
      <meta name="description" content="DESCRIPTION
A broken marriage, a mutual attraction, and forbidden lust—what could possibly happen between mother and son? When June and Tom let their incestuous desire overcome societal norms, they experience endless pleasure. The taboo sex is what these two lovers have always wanted, but will it last? Is it possible for a son to heal his mother’s pain and with personal growth become the man she needs?
EXCERPT  
She seemed poised between resistance and acceptance. She said, “Are you sure, Tom?” 
“I’ve never been more certain.” I kissed her again. It seemed I could feel her thinking and then I felt her waver, then relent and she kissed me back. She moved her whole body to me, straining toward me. I took my hand away from her pussy sliding it up to her breast, pulling her nightie up in the same motion, cupping her other breast, squeezing and rubbing her nipple. 
She was breathing so much faster. “Yes. All right. Hurry! Please!” she said. I kissed her again, this time pushing my tongue in her mouth, and she responded, kissing me back. Her hands went around my neck and down my back and then up again. I pulled her nightie up and off and slid her panties down. She lifted a little to help me. I moved over her, my cock at her opening, and let my weight down on her, feeling her soft flesh, her warm belly, her breasts against my chest. I kissed her again. “Put it in, Tommy, hurry,” she said. She opened her legs wider, then brought them up and moved her middle so she was pushing up against me. “Tommy, hurry, your cock… Put it in me, baby!” 
“I’m hurrying…” I was pushing a little too high, missing her opening.
She brought her hands down to my bottom and pulled me against her, then moved one hand under me and took my cock. I raised a little and she guided the head to her lips. “Right there, Tom, push!” I did, and entered her again, sliding all the way in.
“Oh, Tommy, yes! That’s it, honey,” she said. “That’s it, baby,” she said, her wet warmth again enveloping me. “Oh yes, baby, yes,” as I began a slow easy stroking.  “Yes, just like that. Oh, honey, it feels so good.” She was holding me as tightly to her as she could, her breath against my neck and ear, saying, “That’s it, baby.” Feeling full of my power I began to move faster. “Yes, faster honey!” she said. While I was stroking her I was rubbing my body on hers, sort of up and down and back and forth, in a kind of circle. I kissed her again and she kissed me back hard, her hands on my back and neck, pulling me to her." />
