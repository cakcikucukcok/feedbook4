  <title>Hands On - Cathryn Fox</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Hands On is the first of a three-part erotic series&lt;/b&gt; from New York Times and USA best-selling author Cathryn Fox.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When hot as hell Danielle Lang showed up and asked me to teach her about sex, I thought I was hallucinating. Turns out the beautiful psychologist needed an extra bit of schooling in all things sexual so she could teach a class. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I&#39;m always up for helping a friend. I mean, it&#39;s the least I can do. What I wasn&#39;t expecting is for her to turn the tables and teach me a few things. Only this short-term promise of two weeks in her bed is going by a little too quickly. Not that I&#39;m thinking forever or anything. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I&#39;ve got a football career to get back to. And she doesn&#39;t want to be a part of my world. There&#39;s no way we can be together--so I&#39;m going to make sure I enjoy every sexy second....&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;This is the first of a three-part series full of mind-blowing sex, featuring a dirty-mouthed football player who knows the score and an inexperienced therapist who needs to learn it.  HANDS ON is sure to leave readers begging for more. The next installment, Body Contact, will be published  August 2016.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Hands On serial is best enjoyed in order.&lt;br&gt;Reading Order:&lt;br&gt;Book #1 Hands On&lt;br&gt;Book #2 Body Contact&lt;br&gt;Book #3 Full Exposure&lt;/p&gt;" />
