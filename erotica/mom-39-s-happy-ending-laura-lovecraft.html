  <title>Mom&#39;s Happy Ending - Laura Lovecraft</title>
      <meta name="description" content="When Tom and his friends win money they give themselves a serious treat: a &amp;lsquo;happy ending&amp;rsquo; massage at Nikki&amp;#39;s Spa. The spa has a policy of keeping the girls anonymous, and Tom keeps a towel over his face the entire time. Tom has an incredible time, and his ending was pretty damn happy. Tom&amp;#39;s happy ending is about to turn into a surprise ending when he finds out who gave him his massage: his mother!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
~~~~~ Excerpt ~~~~~&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;I bring it up because it&amp;rsquo;s still true,&amp;rdquo; he told her, walking over to stand in front of the coffee table. &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;m in college now and Matt&amp;rsquo;s still showing guys your picture and telling them about,&amp;rdquo; he rolled his eyes. &amp;ldquo;Tom&amp;rsquo;s hot mom. He says he&amp;rsquo;s trying to get me more friends.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Friends like that you don&amp;rsquo;t need. Tell Matt if he doesn&amp;rsquo;t stop I&amp;rsquo;ll get pictures of when he was a fat little kid from his mom and send you to school with them.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;That would be awesome!&amp;rdquo; Tom clapped his hands.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Mom shook her head, then rubbed at her cheek and Tom noticed she had the same deep red on her nails Molly had.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Get your nails done today?&amp;rdquo; he asked, a little unnerved that seeing his mother&amp;rsquo;s nails got him thinking about what Molly&amp;rsquo;s hand would have looked like on his&amp;hellip;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Yup, toes too.&amp;rdquo; Mom gave him a sly smile. &amp;ldquo;Got another treat today too.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Right!&amp;rdquo; Tom remembered. &amp;ldquo;You said you were going to treat yourself to something today and it was a surprise. Did you do it?&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;I did.&amp;rdquo; Mom&amp;rsquo;s smile grew. &amp;ldquo;Not sure if you&amp;rsquo;ll like the idea, but this was something I&amp;rsquo;d always wanted and never had the nerve, but the other day I said screw it and decided to get this!&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Mom sat back and lifting her leg put her bare foot on the table.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
On the top of her foot was a brand-new, still red, swollen, and way-too-familiar tattoo.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;It&amp;rsquo;s&amp;hellip;a butterfly,&amp;rdquo; Tom whispered feeling as if he&amp;rsquo;d just been punched in the stomach.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;ve always loved them, and they signify change, and life&amp;rsquo;s been a lot of changes the last year, and I feel like I&amp;rsquo;m finally changing to match it.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Tom nodded, as his mind was overwhelmed with a rapid fire series of thoughts. The nails and tattoo same as Molly. Mom was Molly. Mom&amp;rsquo;s new part time job was a masseuse who gave &amp;lsquo;happy endings.&amp;rsquo; Mom was performing sexual acts on total strangers.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
His mother had given him a blowjob!" />
