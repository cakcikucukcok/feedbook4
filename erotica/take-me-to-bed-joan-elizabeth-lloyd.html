  <title>Take Me To Bed - Joan Elizabeth Lloyd</title>
      <meta name="description" content="In this sizzling duet of erotic novels, two women discover that friends can be the best teachers--no matter what the lesson is.  .  .   &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  &lt;b&gt;  The Pleasures Of Jessicalynn&lt;/b&gt;  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;    After thirteen years of mediocre sex with her soon-to-be-ex-husband, Jessie is convinced she has no sex appeal, no sex drive, and no talent in bed. But her oldest friend, Steph, doesn&#39;t see her that way--and neither does Steph&#39;s husband, Brian. In fact, Brian has been lusting after Jessie since college. And not only is that fine with Steph--it turns her on because she and her husband have a very special marriage. When Jess comes to their home for a visit, it&#39;s the perfect time to introduce her to their way of life--and to the sensual woman inside her.  .  .   &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;    &lt;b&gt;  Velvet Whispers&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;      Since her divorce, thirty-two-year-old Alice has filled her life with work, friends, and family, but no love life. In fact, her sexuality seems a thing of the past. But now she may need to rediscover it. When her mother falls ill, Alice desperately needs extra cash for nursing care. So her friend, Betsy, lets her in on a naughty money-making secret: an elite phone sex service. As she creates steamy fantasies and role plays for nice guys who just want to talk dirty, Alice enters a world of real-life pleasure that&#39;s more than just talk.  .  ." />
