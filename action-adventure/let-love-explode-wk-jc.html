      <meta name="description" content="War: 1 a) armed hostilities between esp. nations; conflict(war broke out; war zone). b) a specific conflict or the period of time during which such conflict exists(was before the war). c) the suspension of international law etc. during such a conflict. Weapons, guns, swords, archers, horses, canons, dogs, etc, etc. Only one thing here is actually of import: kill the enemy. That is war. This time though, its different. You see, even though we live in this world, we do not wage war as the world does. The weapons we fight with are not weapons of this world. On the contrary, they have divine power to demolish strongholds. We demolish arguments and every pretension that sets itself up against the knowledge of GOD, and we take captive every thought and make it obedient to CHRIST. And we will be ready to punish every act of disobedience, once your obedience is complete. This time there are no negotiations. You choose a side and the other side will fight you. William S. Carter is the P.U.I.s (Protection Unit for Innocents) superior. He stands for YAHWEH. Aster B. Vortick is the head of the O.D.D. (Organisation of Death and Destruction). He stands against HIM. Carter and his people helps everyone. Vortick, he destroys. Everything he has, he kills. This results into fear, he doesnt make empty threats. He says he will kill anyone who refuses his rules and because the human race is so afraid of death, they fear him. This makes Carter desperate. He trains everyone who knows and love YAHWEH, not caring if its a girl of 15 or a man of 51. But HE truly looks out for HIS people. Vorticks people on the other hand, when they are in any contact with HIS people, they die. Carter has built a shelter on YAHWEHS command. He calls it the S.T.A.D.I.U.M. (Superior Trademark of Awesome yet Dangerous and Impeccable Unifying Miracles) This is where YAHWEHs people worship. There is food and drink, a place to stay, prayer rooms, healing chambers, live music, testimonies, preaching... everything your heart desires. It is built out of stone, the walls are decorated with palm trees. There is no fear. The security is impeccable for it is protected by YAHWEH HIMSELF. Everyone who is against HIM, dies when they set foot 5km away. The world, however, isnt this blessed. Everything changed. If youre for YAHWEH, you get hunted, captured, tortured and killed; whether youve said anything or not. If youre against HIM, you get hunted, knocked unconscious and you will find a piece of paper when you wake up. It will be an invitation to the S.T.A.D.I.U.M.. Bring it with you, youre life will change. Throw it away, you will die. Yeah, the world has gone mad." />
