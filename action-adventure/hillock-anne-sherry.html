  <title>Hillock - Anne Sherry</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This story is about a unique and secret place: Hillock. Hillock is a government base that trains animals to work with humans, doing amazing things. Animals had to be trained with keepers and had to be bonded, but as each trainer either moved on or left the program, the animals had refused to work with new people and had to be retired off and replaced. As each new animal were introduced to the program, more problems had been found as the animals would only work with people they chose. Age was another problem; the older the keepers were, the less they could keep up with the animals. 
As more problems crept up, the program had to be rearranged, and it was decided that older teens were the answer. However, teens could not be pulled off the streets and they had to have certain abilities and stamina. It was then that a plan was organized. Young juveniles were researched; they had to have certain qualities, abilities, and the right kind of personality. A social worker would be employed and would keep in touch with the police. The right kind of teen would be selected and taken to a correction facility, and from there to Hillock, they would be introduced to the animals and, if selected, would join the team. 
Over the years, several groups of teens had been researched, but only a few had been chosen to work with the animals. However, only one or two of them had succeeded, until now. As a new group of teens were brought to Chippingham, the correction facility, five young people stood out from the rest: Nathan and Jemma Jackson, Liam and Ashley Denver, and Naz Weza. Would they be chosen to join the team?" />
