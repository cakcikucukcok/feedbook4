  <title>Air Force Cadet - Winston Forde</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This story was written as one of a series of books covering some familiar professions intended to entertain, as well as inform.
It was a glorious opportunity for the new author to write about his most unusual choice of a career and life after school, whilst others were going for the traditional professions of Law, Medicine, and Engineering.
The Story starts with the main Character, Ola, just about to end his school days at the Prince of Wales School, and applying for a Cadetship at the Royal Air force College, Cranwell in Lincolnshire, United Kingdom.
Even for the British candidates, that training leading to a Commission in the Royal Air Force was only available to a select few, and so this was bound to be dealing with the mainly unknown. Soon after his acceptance by a local Selection Board, Ola embarks on a series of personal experiences that took him overseas to Europe for the first time, and a life in a Temperate country with quite different customs, and weather.
He has little time to adjust to his new way of life, and to attend a proper Selection Board before arriving at the College to start his training, and life as a Flight Cadet that would last over a period of three years. The reader is made to feel every bit of this military and exciting journey involving so many special programmes that would turn those young men into fully trained pilot officers on Passing Out.
The jewel in the story is, of course, Olas experiences in the air whilst flying in trainer aircraft or in gliders, and this together with the adventure, comradeship, and achievements gained through discipline, and determination would leave any young reader wanting more. Ironically, Winston ends his career working with the young cadets in the Air Training Corps who would undoubtedly find this riveting reading." />
