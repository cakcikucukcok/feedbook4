      <meta name="description" content="The year is 2019 in Mirror City, a man-made island off the coast of Georgia. Jax Kourt, along with the few surviving members of his former Bloodrunner gang, discover that the most popular president in United States history is a deep cover terrorist set on reshaping the world the way he sees fit. 
Fresh off a five-year prison sentence for armed robbery, and seeing an opportunity for one last score before retiring from the streets, Jax and his split personality alter ego ghost, along with the remains of his former gang strike a deal with a DOD agent who believes their story to expose the president for what he is in exchange for clean records. He and the rest of his friends will be forced to battle the mob, the United States government, a phantom terrorist organization, along with demons from their past that still haunt them if theyre to come out on top. Jax has never been one to do anything unless it involves a big payday or protecting the ones he loves but soon realizes hes undertaken a project that will push him and his team to their physical, mental, and emotional limits and well beyond to stand for something far greater than money or power." />
