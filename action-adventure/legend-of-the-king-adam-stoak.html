      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Legend of the King is a fantasy battle manga about a fearless 12 year old boy named Kios, who is living the life of an ordinary shepherd boy. Then suddenly he finds his life transformed forever when he meets the mystical seer, Zora, who selects Kios to be the newly anointed king of Kavalie. While on his journey to fulfill his new destiny, Kios finds that the trek is loaded with colossal challenges. At every turn there are overwhelming obstacles to conquer, not the least of which is the fact that theres already a king sitting on the Kavalie throne. King Azor, a king teetering on the edge of insanity. And it goes without saying that hes unwilling to give up his throne to the likes of a young, unproven whelp. Complicating matters even more is the ever present threat of the Dark Nation, Which has been at war with the Kavalie people for more than 100 years. So, to save his nation, Kios must face off against, and defeat, King Azor and the 7 invincible Dark Lords.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Can Kios overcome these obstacles and claim his rightful place as king?&lt;/p&gt;" />
