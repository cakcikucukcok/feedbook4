  <title>Mirages of the Rub Al-Khali - George P. Matheos</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;I&gt;Ritchie savored the excitement he was sensing in the darkness of the room. Not the excitement of adrenaline induced fear but the excitement of adrenaline pumped anxiety and anticipation. This was the promised feast that Abdullah had turned into a nightmare, that night, almost two months before. He had been an unkind host this Bedu-made-in America Abdullah. He had grievously injured his trusting guests, had been cunning in his deception, and merciless in his cruelty. Grievously he had erred and grievously he was going to pay for his sin. He could no longer be trusted, this raving mad dog of an Arab. He had made a mistake of major proportions in betraying the friendship of an American.&lt;/I&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;In a series of murderous adventures, Glassier takes terrorism to the center of the Rub al-Khali Desert. To his surprise, this area also known as the Empty Quarter is not only full of oil, but also of love, hatred, sex, drugs, and above all-mirages-the ultimate level playing field.&lt;/P&gt;" />
