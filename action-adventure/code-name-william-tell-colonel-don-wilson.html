  <title>Code Name: William Tell - Colonel Don Wilson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Code Name: William Tell&lt;/i&gt; is an adventure story that starts with an idea by the president of the United States, from which a hero emerges. A story of goods triumph over evil, as told by a famous historian who himself is a retired army lieutenant colonel. The story traces the life of our hero from boyhood to manhood and then to a leader of men fighting a secret cold war. Our villain is known to the free worlds intelligence community only by the code name KRAIT, a deadly viper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One day, near the end of an unsuccessful term, a president in the solitude of the Oval Office found time to think of some way to make amends for his failures. He gave his imagination free rein. Soon an idea began to grow into a solution to a serious problem: a solution which would become the closest-held secret since the atomic bomb. From this secret would come a remarkable man, code name William Tell.&lt;/p&gt;" />
