  <title>Job Card - Maurice White</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;It is about a man that stumbles across three credit cards he fi nds in a secret room,
after being nosey walking around a Federal Government Building his company was
call to do a job for by mistake.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mistaken made because the name of the company is the same name called
by the State to their own demo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given a badge to walk around the building to use the rest room when they
need to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hutch takes advantage by walking where he shouldnt and comes across
another badge where he puts it on and winds up some where he shouldnt be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By dumb lucky he goes into what he thinks is a bathroom and there presses
a tile in the wall, it activates another part of a wall in one of the stall of the
bathroom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In that stall the 3 credit cards are displayed to him, not knowing that the
Government uses these Unlimited Funded Untraceable credit card to buy whatever
they need no matter how much it cost.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still being nosey after taken the credit cards, Hutch ventures into the
basement where theyre experimenting on some colognes and their reaction on
the females that one would encounter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are three that work with a mans sweat, the more he sweats the
stronger the cologne affect is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One is black capped and that puts fear to a woman that smell it, the gold
cap one makes a woman very mad at the one wearing it that she strikes at him in
anger.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The last one is the silver capped one that makes woman very horny and all
colognes seem to have a very long lingering affect when the man sweats heavy.
Using the card a few times Hutch encounters, some good people and then
two unsavory men that feel he doesnt deserve to have such a thing and want it
for themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Car chases and jealous coworkers, greedy gold digging girlfriend with
vengeful spitefulness about her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Three fine healthy video type vixens that are just down to earth, best friends
since little and now strip dancers making their way through college.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Along with Hutchs old time friends the Grand Drunken Master, that party
hard with him and always there in a heartbeat to lend a hand no matter where
Hutch is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Together this story has some of the most exciting things about Hutch and
how his life goes and not even on a daily run, but just saying to one self.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What would you do if you came across three unlimited funded untraceable
credit cards and didnt know it till late.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this three part story read how Hutch handles every situation and his tattle
tale coworker.&lt;/p&gt;" />
