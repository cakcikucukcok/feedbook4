  <title>The Unforgettable Vampire - Bailey Ziehmer</title>
      <meta name="description" content="In The Unforgettable Vampire, you meet Bailey Chase, an eighteen-year-old girl who lives with her alcoholic dad. They just moved to Williams, Arizona, where Bailey expected a new start and a new life. Sadly, at first, she doesnt get her wish. Her dad is still an alcoholic, and her mother is dead. The worst part is she has had to up and leave all her friends. When Bailey meets Damon Jackson, it isnt love at first sight. And when Bailey finds out what he is and what the town is full of, she instantly draws more attached to the town. Damon is the bad boy of the town, the one most girls throw themselves at, but Damon wont let them in. Bailey and Damon end up discovering theyre more alike than they thought, and their friendship turns into something more. You soon find that Damon is an uncontrollable monster, according to his brother, Steven Jackson. Though Damon may try to fight it and others may not believe it, Bailey ends up being the one thing Damon needs: a friend, a lover, and an unforgettable angel." />
