  <title>Mind Games - Richard Payne</title>
      <meta name="description" content="After a difficult youth, David Carter had become an excellent journalist for the Guardian. Whilst working full-time, he met a young woman named Susan, and they were preparing to get married. David was born with epilepsy, and as he was growing up, many people tormented him because of this condition. He had wonderful family support when he was a child and as he grew up through school and college. Eventually his life settled down, and he studied for a career in journalism. After many years of health difficulties, his dream came true, and at last everything in his life appeared calm and tranquil. 
One day near Easter, Davids brother, Matthew, asked him if he would like to spend a weekend with him in Cardiff, having already booked the rooms at a bed and breakfast. During their weekend, it was revealed that David had been adopted when he was just three and a half years old. David was horrified, and though he did not want to, he felt that it was his duty as an undercover journalist to find out more about his real mother. 
He found his mother living in a small flat in Milton Keynes, and though she did not want to speak with him, he forced his way in. There she revealed more about his real upbringing. The news horrified David even more and turned his settled life upside down, confusing him and aggravating his epilepsy. 
His life changed yet again when he was involved in a car crash. Some people believed hed suffered an epileptic attack at the steering wheel, but there was no evidence to prove this. He was taken to hospital seriously injured and in a coma. He remained there for several months, until eventually he slowly opened his eyes and began his recovery. 
Again he seemed a changed man, only wanting to live a life of peace and love with everybody. This change amazed and delighted Susan, and they made final preparations for their wedding and a new beginning." />
