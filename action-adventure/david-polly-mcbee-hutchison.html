  <title>David - Polly McBee Hutchison</title>
      <meta name="description" content="David is just fourteen when he courageously kills a black-maned lion to rescue the flock of sheep in his protection. Even at his young age, he is focused on becoming a great warrior who will one day fight to defeat Israels enemies. But when David is suddenly summoned home from the fields by his father, everything changes.
After David learns that King Saul has summoned him to play and sing for him in an effort to drive away an evil spirit, he immediately travels from Bethlehem to Gilgal, all while praying he can fulfill the order. Soon after David befriends the kings son, Jonathan, he is released by Saul after his musical efforts seemingly fail. When David is eventually anointed to become the future King of Israel after God rejects Sauls rebellious house and Jonathan as the next-in-line to take the throne, he fears Jonathan will hate him. Just as David is thrust to the heights of fame and glory, the king sets out on a vengeful quest that changes everything once again.
In this biblical tale set in ancient Israel, a young man embarks on a coming-of-age journey that he hopes leads him to his destinyunless someone stops him first." />
