  <title>The Queen of the Universe - Dora Klinova</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Dora Klinova has produced a fascinating volume, a labor of love and a tribute to Water. The Queen of the Universe is a story about a little shy Drop of water who became a mighty River, and then a huge powerful Ocean Wave that has carried vital energy from continent to continent. It reads like a fairy tale, exotic yet simple, gives inspiration, and by its powerful potentiality, it is reminiscent of Richard Bachs Jonathan Livingston Seagull and as memorable and meaningful as Saint-Exuperys The Little Prince.
This book is about the power and courage we all have within to pursue the intricate path to understand who we really are and to achieve the highest peak of our life journey. This magical volume presents incredible information about the role of water in nature in a cheerful, entertaining and romantic way. Enjoy!
Your Queen of the Universe is quite a remarkable story! It is charming and flows beautifully. You&#39;ve covered each aspect of Droplets adventures in a lively, emotional and thought-provoking way. It carries just the right balance of tension and suspense in just the right places for the reader to engage and want to know more. Your voice and philosophy will resonate with any reader and that&#39;s the most important thing with this terrific story. Well done, Dora!
