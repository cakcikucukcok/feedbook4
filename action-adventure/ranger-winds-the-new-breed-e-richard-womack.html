  <title>Ranger Winds: the New Breed - E. Richard Womack</title>
      <meta name="description" content="In their early years, the Texas Rangers protected the settlers from Mexicans and Indians along the river. As time passed, the Rangers became lawmen, protecting Texas after the Civil War. Now, times are changing and the Rangers must change with them. These men are known as the new breed.
In this fourth book in the Ranger Winds Series by author E. Richard Womack, the Rangers still mourn the death of Ranger Captain Laughlin McFarland, a legend and the fastest gun in Texas. Captain Jones has been selected to replace McFarland, Dusty McFarland and Boots Law have become Ranger Captains in Uvalde and Abilene respectively, and Ryder McCoy has been assigned to establish a new station in Fort Worth. Newfangled inventions, such as one of the first horseless carriages in Texas, keep the men on their toesas do a gang of highwaymen and the Pinkerton detective sent to catch them.
Although new forensics and techniques have made detection procedures more efficient and simple, theres still plenty to keep the Rangers busy as murder, robberies, rustling, and general mayhem still plague the West as they rush headlong into the twentieth century." />
