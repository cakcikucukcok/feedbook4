      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Only one thing stands between Never and answers &amp;ndash; his brother.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Driven toward the enemy-occupied Imperial City, Never&amp;rsquo;s doubts grow. Even with new knowledge about his powers, can he truly keep his friends safe in a warzone? Or, like too many times before, will he end up responsible for the deaths of those he should have protected?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Never faces a bitter choice between finally winning the answers he has searched for all his life and stopping his brother once and for all. Worse, he knows that if he hesitates, Snow&amp;rsquo;s sinister vision for the world will come to pass.&lt;/p&gt;" />

(Tomorrow or so, these will have links, but for now itâ€™s just the images)<br /><b><i>Imperial Towers | Ashley Capes</i></b> | Imperial Towers (Book of Never #5) is now available at Amazon and Kobo and very soon at B&amp;N and (hopefully) at Google Play also. Purchase â€“ Amazon &amp; Kobo, All Territories. The link above is a â€˜global linkâ€™ so no matter where you are in the world, the link will send you a page where you can choose between Amazon, B&amp;N and Kobo, which then defaults to your territory ðŸ™‚<br /><b><i>Imperial Towers â€“ Available Now | Ashley Capes</i></b> | Imperial Towers, #5 and the conclusion to the Book of Never by Aussie author Ashley Capes was filled with intrigue; gripping and fast paced â€“ as is usual by this author.<br /><p><h3 align="left">Download Ebook|PDF|Epub of <a href=>Imperial Towers - Ashley Capes</a> </h3></p><hr/>
