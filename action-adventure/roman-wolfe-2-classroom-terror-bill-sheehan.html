  <title>Roman Wolfe 2: Classroom Terror - Bill Sheehan</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Roman Wolfe is a Vietnam combat veteran who specialized in the stealthy stalking and killing of the enemy. 
After his military discharge he attends college to become an elementary school teacher. But he is still haunted by his experiences in Vietnam, which cause guilt and bouts of severe depression, all related to the senseless killing that he saw and performed. 
Two years after his Adirondack kidnapping ordeal (Roman Wolfes Adirondack Ordeal, book 1), he is finally able to relax and be happy with his family, his career and with himself. But peace doesnt last long for Roman; darkness follows him like a persistent, evil shadow. 
Romans long awaited, sublime peace is shattered when two escaped prisoners are making a get-away, but are prematurely forced to stop at the school where Roman teaches. Roman and his students are taken hostage by the prisoners. Its then that the mysterious white wolf enters his life, again, after being dormant since the Adirondack kidnapping. 
Roman and his spirit wolf conspire to protect the students and thwart the escape plan of the criminals, but Roman must reluctantly return to his world of violence to protect his cherished students." />
