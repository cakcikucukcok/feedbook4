  <title>The Ambiance of Victoria - Doug Eiderzen Ph.D.</title>
      <meta name="description" content="A man. A woman. An eternal love. A war. A lifetime commitment to an oath. Though a fictional novel, The Ambiance of Victoria approaches situations of life given, within the realm or domain of World War Two, from the perspectives of two people. The book is a struggle for victory surrounded by an environment of defeat. There is the aftermath reality of war that not only must be accepted, but risen above, surmounted, and overcome. The Ambiance of Victory revolves around two people resolved to survive for their history, their philosophy, and their religion. They endure and exist and continue to exist for each other. In a world of hate; they love. Not only do they greatly care for and love each other, they live for their one common denominator. They live for their disciplines of life and only their love for their God trumps all else. Within The Ambiance of Victoria there is the achievement to worth. For two people, greatly in love, the eventual quality of triumph and achievement becomes reality. 
The above aspects are told from a unique perspective. The lives of two individuals are shaped by the times in which they live and the commitments adhered to and moved toward. There will be the views of many individuals which shape the two main personalities of character. And the two main characters certainly shape each other as they themselves shape others. As the years come and go, they continue to greatly love one another." />
