ABOUT THE AUTHORS&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Robert Michael Ballantyne (24 April 1825 &amp;ndash; 8 February 1894) was a Scottish author of juvenile fiction who wrote more than 100 books. His 1858 novel The Coral Island: A Tale of the Pacific Ocean (1858) is one of the first works of fiction to feature exclusively juvenile heroes. The tale of three boys marooned on a South Pacific island, the only survivors of a shipwreck, was the inspiration for William Golding&amp;#39;s dystopian novel Lord of the Flies (1954).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Daniel Defoe (c.1660 &amp;ndash; 24 April 1731), born Daniel Foe, was an English trader, writer, journalist, pamphleteer, and spy, most famous for his novel Robinson Crusoe, published in 1719.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Henry De Vere Stacpoole (9 April 1863 &amp;ndash; 12 April 1951) was an Irish author. His best known work is the 1908 romance novel The Blue Lagoon, which has been adapted into movies on five occasions.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Robert Louis Balfour Stevenson (13 November 1850 &amp;ndash; 3 December 1894) was a Scottish novelist, poet, essayist, and travel writer. His most famous works are Treasure Island, Kidnapped, and Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Jonathan Swift (30 November 1667 &amp;ndash; 19 October 1745) was an Anglo-Irish satirist, essayist, political pamphleteer (first for the Whigs, then for the Tories), poet and cleric who became Dean of St Patrick&amp;#39;s Cathedral, Dublin.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Johann David Wyss (May 28, 1743 - January 11, 1818) was a Swiss author, best remembered for The Swiss Family Robinson (Der schweizerische Robinson).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Translator William Henry Giles Kingston (28 February 1814 &amp;ndash; 5 August 1880), often credited as W. H. G. Kingston, was an English writer of boys&amp;#39; adventure novels." />
