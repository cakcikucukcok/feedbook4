  <title>Jesse and the Magic Boots - Janina Ward</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Jesse finishes the school year and travels to his grandfathers ranch for what he thought was going to be his routine summer vacation.   Jesse began to wonder what his grandfather meant when he said, If only you had been in my shoes  passing through his grandpas bedroom he pauses to slip his feet into and old worn out pair of grandpas cowboy boots.   Jesse becomes very dizzy and passes out on the bed only to awaken the following morning lying next to a juniper tree out on the range.  The only thing he sees for miles is a horse, saddled and ready to be ridden.  Jesses head still foggy, he mounts the horse and lets it lead the way.   The countryside begins to look familiar and soon he finds himself at the old homesteadonly it had burned to the ground years before!  Upon investigating Jesse finds his great-great grandmother and grandfather only they have also been dead for years.  He soon realizes that he has gone back in time over seventy years and everyone thinks that he is his grandpa Fred.  Jesse has no choice but to do his best to blend in until he can find a way back home.   He learns many things including how to work and brand the cattle.   Jesse goes along as the family takes a wagon trip to the town of Prescott.  Jesse has many close encounters and interesting discoveries as the summer wears on, finally he sees visions in the night urging him to leave soon!   Very adventurous reading for young adults as well as those young at heart.  A stimulating trip into the old west complete with many historic photos to stimulate the imagination!  A must read for anyone that has ever wondered what ranch life was like in our wonderful Arizona history." />
