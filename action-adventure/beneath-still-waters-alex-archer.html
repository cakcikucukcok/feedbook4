  <title>Beneath Still Waters - Alex Archer</title>
      <meta name="description" content="
        &lt;p&gt;A wrecked German bomber…key to the secrets of the Third Reich?&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;All it took was one phone call and TV show host and archaeologist Annja Creed is in mortal danger. Her producer Doug Morrell has been abducted by a greedy treasure hunter who&#39;s seeking the lost raubgold, or looted gold of Nazi Germany. The terms are simple: retrieve the bounty and Doug lives. Fail, and he dies…&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Now Annja and her friends must find a missing German fighter plane that was shot down over the Alps in 1945. According to legend, the aircraft not only holds a shipment of gold the Nazis had stolen, but also carried the last letters of the führer himself. Letters that point to a more startling treasure buried underwater halfway around the world. But Annja isn&#39;t interested in treasure, or even unearthing historic relics. Annja has one agenda: get Doug out alive…even if it means drawing her sword from its otherworldly sheath. Even if it means death.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Because once greed drives a man to violence, nothing will stop him…&lt;/p&gt;
