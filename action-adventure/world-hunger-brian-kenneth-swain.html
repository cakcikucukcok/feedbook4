  <title>World Hunger - Brian Kenneth Swain</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Vanguard Corporation, an agricultural company led by a greedy and mercurial CEO, has developed a new line of genetically modified seed products. Designed to significantly increase crop yields and resist drought, pests, and disease in the hopes of reducing hunger in Third World countries, the seeds should also earn huge profits for the firm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vanguards testing in Belarus, Colombia, and India initially goes well, but midway through the crops development, reports begin to emerge of bizarre insect observations linked to incidents of domestic animal slaughter, and eventually, the death of several people. The high-growth genetic enhancements engineered into the seeds have been transferred into the insects through their ingestion of the test crops. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The strains of these super insects are much larger, more aggressive, and increasingly resistant to pesticides and disease than their natural counterparts. As the insects become more plentiful and widespread, Vanguard desperately combats them while dealing with the media, environmentalists, the government, and other distractions. Meanwhile, scientists, entomologists, and field operatives frantically work together to eradicate the new species and deal with the fallout of mankinds apathy toward environmental meddling.&lt;/p&gt;" />
