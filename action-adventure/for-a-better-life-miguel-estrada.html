  <title>For a Better Life - Miguel Estrada</title>
      <meta name="description" content="English is not the native language of the author, Miguel Estrada.
 Reason why he felt the need to write in simple, easy reading, English language,
 this mix of fiction / non-fiction, romantic, adventurous, book/novel.    
    He bases the fiction part of his book in one of his many love songs hes written.  
    Besides adding a little humor, he also explores how abandonment can sometimes haunt even the most successful among us.   
    In the non-fiction part, he likes to share with the world all the struggles and adversities he endured growing up as a multi racial child in a small village of the Atlantic Coast of his native Panama, in Central America.   And all the difficulties he went through as he hitchhiked his way from his country to The U.S, not knowing for sure where he was going, let alone the English language.
    He also speaks of the government corruption that goes on in his country and many other third world countries.  Which compelled him to leave home in search of a better life for him and his family.  He also emphasizes a great deal of gratitude, throughout his book.
  But most of all, he emphasizes gratitude through the whole book." />
