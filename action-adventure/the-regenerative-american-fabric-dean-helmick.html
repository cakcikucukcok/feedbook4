  <title>The Regenerative American Fabric - Dean Helmick</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This story is written for all those who believe Americas best days still lie ahead. Follow the Walbert family as successive generations of Americans navigate through triumphs and challengesfrom the Great Depression through the modern-day global war on terror. 
As members of the World War II generation, John and Margaret Walbert used the advantages of life in a small Montana town to raise their children and prepare them for the future. Despite Johns best efforts, the relationship with his son Billy crumbled. To salvage the deteriorating father-son relationship, the familys minster, Father Alex, used Montanas great outdoors as a leverage point to reconnect father and son. Many of the things Billy learned with his dad and Father Alex served him well as he connected with his own son Luke during Americas fight against global terror. 
This is an uplifting story about how one family successfully passed Americas torch of freedom from one generation to the next. It illustrates how the American fabric is truly unique in its ability to continually regenerate." />
