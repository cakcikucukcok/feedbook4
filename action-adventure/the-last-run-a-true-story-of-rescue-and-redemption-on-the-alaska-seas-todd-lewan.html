  <title>The Last Run: A True Story of Rescue and Redemption on the Alaska Seas - Todd Lewan</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;It was a desperate mission that made front-page headlines and captured the attention of millions of readers around the world. In January 1998, in the dead of an Alaskan winter, a cataclysmic Arctic storm with hurricane-force winds and towering seas forced five fishermen to abandon their vessel in the Gulf of Alaska and left them adrift in thirty-eight-degree water with no lifeboat. Their would-be rescuers were 150 miles away at the Coast Guard station, with the nearby airport shut down by an avalanche.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Last Run&lt;/strong&gt; is the epic tale of the wreck of the oldest registered fishing schooner in Alaska, a hellish Arctic tempest, and the three teams of aviators in helicopters who withstood 140-mph gusts and hovered alongside waves that were ten stories high. But what makes this more than a true-life page-turner is its portrait of untamed Alaska and the unflappable spirit of people who forge a different kind of life on America&#39;s last frontier, the &quot;end of the roaders&quot; who are drawn to, or flee to, Alaska to seek a final destiny.&lt;/p&gt;" />
