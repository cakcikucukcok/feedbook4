  <title>The Cuban Connection - Donna Marie Robie</title>
      <meta name="description" content="THE MAN: Has Juan Martianos taken the phrase, &quot;What can you do for your country?&quot; to the extreme? How does a patriotic, Cuban sugar cane plantation owner end up in America as a high-ranking comrade in the A.C.P., and just how far will he go for the love of his country?&lt;/p&gt;
THE COUNTRY: Beginning with marauding pirates, fierce Spanish conquistadors, greedy American capitalists, corrupt tyrants and Communists-at what price does the &quot;Jewel of the Antilles,&quot; a beautiful, vibrant, but hostile country, whose motto is &quot;Homeland or Death,&quot; get robbed time, after time, of its freedom?&lt;/p&gt;
THE OPERATION: Masterminded by a man who is himself an orphan, how does an American-based orphanage, housing Cuban refugee boys, perform acts of treason against the powerful U.S.?&lt;/p&gt;
THE CHILDREN: In a country whose advertised slogan is &quot;Nada de muy importante de nino,&quot;-why must children pay for their fathers&#39; sins? Meet Sara Martin, the beautiful daughter who is about to become entangled in the tumultuous, parallel relationship between Cuba and the United States." />
