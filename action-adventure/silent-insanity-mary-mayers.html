  <title>Silent Insanity - Mary Mayers</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;In Toronto, Hannah meets Michael Anderson, a United States Federal Prosecutor from Seattle. They fall into a whirlwind romance that sweeps Hannah off to Seattle as his wife. &lt;P&gt;Michael takes an unplanned leave of absence from the Prosecutor&#39;s office after City Officials and Law Enforcement Personnel are exposed for dealing in drug trafficking and money laundering.&lt;P&gt;On the spur of the moment, Michael rushes off to Fresno where his $250 million business venture is buried knee deep in toxic soil, leaving Hannah all alone and pregnant. She finds herself being terrorized to the edge of insanity, not knowing by who and why until she meets Harry Perkins, an FBI Agent. He convinces her that her loving husband is secretly involved in drug smuggling and is the man behind the terror. By this time, people have mysteriously died and Hannah&#39;s best friend has disappeared.&lt;P&gt;When Michael returns home, he must defend his position while faced by Hannah holding a loaded gun, her mind struggling to hang onto reality.&lt;P&gt;Hannah&#39;s dilemma - Should she listen to the FBI Agent and shoot? Or, should she listen to her heart and trust him?&lt;/P&gt;" />
