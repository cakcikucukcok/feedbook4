  <title>The Golden Griffin - Joe Conceicao</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Burmese Griffin is a historical novel that moves from the present to medieval Myanmar. It was in the 16th Century that Portuguese fighters became a powerful influence over rulers in Myanmars Rakhine region. The name of one leader which stood out among these Portuguese buccaneers was that of Felipe de Brito. He had amassed treasure in the form of jewellery and jade, as well as priceless ancient icons. He was executed by a victorious Myanmar King by being impaled on a spear, for his blasphemous activity. One of which was to steal a huge sacred bell from Myanmars most sacred Pagoda! What happened to de Britos  treasure?
The scene moves to the present day. Tony Carvalhos misadventures in life are depicted to show his navet. But it is his wife, Jeanne de Mello, who is chosen to probe the whereabouts of the hidden treasure. For it is discovered that she   was a descendant of Felipe de Brito. Myanmar experts, with an experience of the latest of knowledge of psychiatry, would combine with Buddhist exponents of meditation, to induce Jeanne to enter into a dream state. Jeanne would, in such condition, be enabled to reach out to her ancestor. She would thus learn where the treasure had been secreted.
Events did not turn out exactly as planned. But the denouement was a destructive surprise for criminal elements in and from Singapore as well as partially satisfying astonishment for the Generals in Myanmar." />
