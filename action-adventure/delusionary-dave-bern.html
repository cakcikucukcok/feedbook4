  <title>Delusionary - Dave Bern</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p align=justify&gt;Ever wonder what you would do if you were struck down, knocked unconscious and when you awoke, discovered you had no recollection of your past life? Your name, family, occupation, as well as your entire past appear wiped out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align=justify&gt;Alone and befuddled you have no clues as to who you are and all you have in your pocket is a crumpled ten dollar bill. Eventually strangers come along and give you a ride. They take you into their world with their friends and then onto another state to a construction job site where they are scheduled to work.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p align=justify&gt;What about the family, friends, and job you left behind? Their lives are entangled with the police and their frustrations are immense. Your past family survives and through the years they start a new family. Delusionary is the story that will lead you into this maze through the years and unfold the journey both families undertake.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align=justify&gt;This might happen to you&lt;/p&gt;" />
