  <title>Nemesis Syndrome - Walt Branam</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Tom and Terry Wolfe have agreed to help the FBI finally bring Vernon Crassman to justice. The evil billionaire has become a bitter, hateful man living in constant pain and agony due to the horrendous injuries he suffered during his last confrontation with the Wolfes. His injuries deprive him of sleep, so his nights are spent plotting revenge against his enemies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Crassman intends to end the troublesome couples lives in a very slow and painful manner. To implement the first part of his plan, the sinister and deadly villain kidnaps Terry. The purpose, of course, is to entice Tom to come find his wife on Crassmans turf. But Tom has been forbidden by the current administration to enter the sanctuary where Crassman hides.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tom is forced to secretly assemble his own private team and illegally infiltrate a hostile country, free his wife, and bring Crassman to final justice. In pursuing this quest, the team travels to exotic locations and pits themselves against the greatest dangers they have ever faced. Not everyone will survive, but once again, the Wolfe pair proves itself a force to be reckoned with.&lt;/p&gt;" />
