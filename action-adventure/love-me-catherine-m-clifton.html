  <title>Love Me - Catherine M. Clifton</title>
      <meta name="description" content="From the outside, Rhonda Brown appears to be a normal, straight-A college student in Tallahassee, Florida.  In reality, she&#39;s a drug dealer, fashioning cocaine into high-priced and highly sought after dolls.  Justifying her crimes, she believes she was forced into this lifestyle after the death of her parents; after all, she needs the money to support her and her older sister, Caroline.
But Rhonda&#39;s patience with Caroline, who is battling her own demons, is coming to an end.  Anything to do with Caroline is a lose-lose situation, and Rhonda is ready to get out.  Just as she plans to leave, Caroline hints there is more to her sad life story than drugs, prostitution, and self-loathing.  Unwilling to let go, Rhonda initiates her own investigation into Caroline&#39;s past-and what she uncovers hits her and everyone around her like a whirlwind.
Rhonda soon discovers the story she has always known about her life is actually nothing but a lie.  Surrounded by drugs, lies, and a long list of betrayals, Rhonda must come to terms with the decisions she has made, and the journey she takes to get there will change her life forever." />
