  <title>The Gladiator - K. R. Brown</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Eighteen-year-old Amelia Bennett has been training her entire life to become a full-fledged member of the Future Leaders of America (FLA), an organization centered in Montana that trains students how to be good leaders. Unlike most of the trainees in the program, however, Amelia and her twin brother, Jayden, were born with special powers, helping them to advance quickly.&lt;p&gt;
Just as Amelia achieves her goal of joining the FLA, her world is shattered by the rise of a supervillain with similar powers, called the Heart Breaker, who devastates the organization out of revenge. In order to save the FLA, Amelia, Jayden, and their fellow trainee Will must set out on a cross-country adventure in order to learn more about the evil villains plot. As the Heart Breakers forces wreak havoc across the nation, Amelia and Jayden are forced to repeatedly delay their mission in order to fight back, causing them to rise to fame and earn the nicknames the Gladiator and the Hypnotist. Over time, the trio begins to learn more about the inner workings and secrets of the FLA and their own possibly dark role in the Heart Breakers plan.&lt;p&gt;
In this science fiction novel for young adults, a young woman uses her abilities to protect the people she loves and stand up for what she believes ineven though she isnt sure what to believe." />
