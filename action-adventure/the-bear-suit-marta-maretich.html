  <title>The Bear Suit - Marta Maretich</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Rollo is tired of humans. Their cities are dirty, and their gizmos are dumb. He knows mankind is wrecking the planet. Rollo’s dream is to escape to the Sierra Nevada Mountains where he can live alone and be free of other people.
There’s just one problem with his scheme: Rollo’s hungry human stomach.
No matter how much food he carries in his backpack, he always runs out. Inevitably, Rollo has to come back to the “messed-up, man-made world” or starve.
All this changes when Rollo finds an old, dusty, bear suit in a costume shop. He’s got a plan! But what seems like the perfect solution at first will bring unexpected results and change Rollo’s life forever—in ways he could never have imagined." />
