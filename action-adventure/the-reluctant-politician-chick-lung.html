  <title>The Reluctant Politician - Chick Lung</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The book begins with the kidnapping of Tony Denton&#39;s sixteen year old niece at a car wash and his involvement with the police as they try to locate her. Things start going wrong when police officers are pulled from the kidnapping case to work as decoys on a sting in the red light district, arresting prostitutes and their &quot;johns&quot;. Tony losses it as he rants and raves against management of the police force in his hometown.
     When people tell Tony to stop griping and do something about it he reluctantly runs for sheriff, and to his surprise he wins the office. His only promise on the campaign trail had been that he would not allow any of his officers to be involved in arresting prostitutes or their &quot;johns&#39;s&quot;, nor would he allow an officer to arrest anyone using drugs, which causes an uproar within the relgious community.
     Tony is so successful at taking his police officers away from these two areas and putting them to work solving the brutual murders and rapes that take place in his town that within the first two years the number of all major crimes in the town take a major nose dive. Even the papers in larger cities take notice and begin writing accounts of the small town sheriff that has a new method of fighting crimes.
     Soon Tony is being asked to run for higher office and this starts the remarkable story of the reluctant politician who changes the system, but as is always the case with the old saying, &quot;be careful what you wish for, it might come true&quot;, in Tony&#39;s case he pulls the nation down a slippery slope faster and faster to destruction." />
