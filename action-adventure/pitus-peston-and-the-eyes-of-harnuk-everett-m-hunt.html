  <title>Pitus Peston and the Eyes of Harnuk - Everett M. Hunt</title>
      <meta name="description" content="PITUS PESTON AND THE EYES OF HARNUK is the second episode in the
PEREGRINATIONS OF PITUS PESTON.
Imagine a young man who lived two hundred years ago, whose destiny seemed to be
to work the small family farm along the upper Hudson but whose intellect soared
far above his times and station. This young man dared to dream a blasphemous
dream of travel to worlds and peoples among the stars. Now imagine that he
discovered not only a means of fulfi lling his dream, but found himself in a quest to
fi nd a source of knowledge rivaling that of the Almighty Himself.
Pitus Peston who solved the riddle hidden in a wampum sash of the location of
a derelict alien ship atop a butte in what is now Monument Valley, is journeying
with his companion Calnoon Atoye Itah, a native of Oman, to this world on the
opposite arm of the Milky Way. Atoye, eager to end his long exile and return home
hopes to reward his friend Pitus with astounding scenes of his highly advanced
civilization.
When they reach their distant goal, they fi nd not the wonders of an advanced
civilization but the ruins of war, but a new objective avails itself in the search for
Loma&#39;s Cube, the seat of accumulated knowledge spanning the eons of the last era
before the last Big Bang swallowed it up in the last Big Crunch. They are not alone
in this quest. A rival from the planet Haldan, the other faction in what became
known as The Thirty-Minutes War, seeks the cube for its secrets of propulsion and
weaponry to make possible a new empire engulfi ng ultimately the whole galaxy." />
