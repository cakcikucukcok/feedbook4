  <title>Puget Chase - Tim Barney</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Davis Jefferson, known to his friends as Deej, lives on Bainbridge Island in Puget Sound off the coast of Washington. Hes a good natured, well-meaning guy with tons of friends. He wishes the best for everyone, which is why hes friendly when newcomer Deirdre arrives in town with her young son Jimmy, all the way from Manhattan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, Deirdre has a dark secret. She didnt move for a change of scenery; she moved to escape a dangerous past. Shes hoping to run from regret and find freedom in her new home, but the past has a way of coming back. Deej just happens to be in the right (or wrong) place at the right time and becomes embroiled in Deirdres troubles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The hunt for revenge is on. Deej and Deirdre have to dodge kidnappers and murderers in a world of misdeeds and gambling. Luckily, the small Puget Sound community bands together to protect their own, so ordinary folks and a troupe of war veterans team up to fight some angry mobsters in the hopes of good conquering all thats evil.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A compelling action-intensive thriller that examines the idea which mankind ultimately seeks and needs--to be seen and understood and for others to take us as we are. This riveting tale highlights the fight between good and evil and the gray area that lies between as Barneys characters struggle for the things that matter most to them--family, honoring thy self, and love.&lt;/p&gt;
