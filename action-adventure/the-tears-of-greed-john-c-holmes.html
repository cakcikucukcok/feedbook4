  <title>The Tears of Greed - John C. Holmes</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The opening chapters introduce the criminal elements whose atrocities have an impact throughout Kenya, Uganda, and South Africa. In South Africa, the reader meets a staunch conservationist family, the Smits, and their contributions to the eventual resolution of many criminal dockets in South Africa. A serious attack at a taxi rank in Durban leaves a member of the ruling political party dead, and the South African Police Services become involved with the case which is soon found to have strong links to Kenya. This murderous ex-mercenary is connected to various crimes in South Africa, and it is discovered that he is a main supplier of contraband and controls a poaching ring and a smuggling outfit operating in Ulundi which is adjacent to the Imfolozi/Hluhluwe Game reserve. The Kenyan Law enforcement agency is found to be corrupt with the exception of the assistant commissioner of police and his newly formed branch. This division starts investigating past unresolved cases and soon smashes a criminal syndicate. The South Africans are involved and a crack antipoaching team is involved to the end of a serious poaching expedition." />
