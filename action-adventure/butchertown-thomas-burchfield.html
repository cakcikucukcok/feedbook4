  <title>Butchertown - Thomas Burchfield</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Paul Bacon&lt;em&gt;, &lt;/em&gt;ex-Navy boxer and fun-loving, Jazz-Age fashion plate, moved to 1920s California for the endless sunshine, oranges, and bright, white beaches. But all he finds is loneliness and misery in the chilly, fog-choked canyons of San Francisco.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One night, homesick and miserable, he meets, and falls for, Molly Carver, a mysterious beauty who lures him on a romantic weekend escapade across the Bay to her hometown of Evansville. There, she promises, he will find the California promised by the travel brochures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Molly&amp;rsquo;s promise turns out to be camouflage for a dangerous game. Evansville is no paradise but a whirling sewer of slaughterhouses, oil refineries, factories and dens of Prohibition iniquity. After stumbling across the brutal murder of Molly&amp;rsquo;s brother, Paul must fight for his life while caught in the crossfire of a bloody gang war over the town&amp;rsquo;s teeming vice rackets. and playing diplomat-at-gunpoint between the two warring factions. If he wants to get out alive, he&amp;rsquo;d better find the path to peace between two groups who know little of it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They don&amp;rsquo;t call it &amp;ldquo;Butchertown&amp;rdquo; for nothing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Set in the early years of Prohibition and the Roaring 20s, &lt;em&gt;Butchertown &lt;/em&gt;is a bullet-packed tale populated by scheming ambitious bootleggers, trigger-happy gangsters, devious molls, and even a pair of fanatic Prohibitionists--one of them an old flame of Paul&amp;rsquo;s&amp;mdash;raging to force their ideals on a fallen unwilling world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Butchertown&lt;/em&gt; is also the story of a softboiled guy trapped in a hardboiled world, the hair-raising adventure of a callow but decent young man as he desperately tries to forge a sensible peace out of an insensible situation. As Paul Bacon is pulled deeper into Butchertown&amp;rsquo;s bloody whirlpool, down to the secrets lurking at its heart, he also comes to wonder if the new world of the twentieth century is one people can live in.&lt;/p&gt;" />
