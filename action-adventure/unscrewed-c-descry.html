  <title>Unscrewed! - C. Descry</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Annie has a mountain of misinformation to conquer as she stumbles into life and learns to deal with her physical and spiritual self.
She is thrust into marriage and parenthood in a time when women can&#39;t trust the advice of their mothers-any older women. Her baby boomer generation has been freed by the pill. She must define herself as the first of a new breed of women. 
Sex is an invasion. Love an obligation. Parenthood a guilt-trip. She fights for her children&#39;s education and learns the appalling truth about public education. 
Annie bares her soul and takes us on a voyage through life&#39;s quests. You&#39;ll love this book because you have shared personally or as a mate-the same search for meaning." />
