      <meta name="description" content="The scientist Jessica Salles didn&#39;t stop complaining, especially after her discovery was announced as the merit of her former teacher. It was not easy to admit that the science academy had ignored her. Only Father Victor, expulsed by Cornelio from the USP laboratories, had shown interest in her research. They became friends until Victor was attacked, almost losing his life. Police had linked the beating to other murders. But why had he survived? Suddenly Jessica&#39;s life was upside down. Victor had given her a mission: to travel to El Salvador, meet the ARL research centre, and find scientist Eduardo Miller, who would reveal to her the whole truth about the prophecies. But before Miller could give her explanations, nature had shown its fury... Now she needed to reach the legendary Mayan temple and help the chosen one in his mission. The future of all mankind is in her hands. If she fails, everyone will die!&lt;br/&gt;" />
