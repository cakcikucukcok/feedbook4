  <title>Lives on Hiatus - Jill Owen</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Morgan Cole is as egotistical as they come. A successful businessman obsessed with power, Cole is accustomed to using whatever methods he likes to get what he wants. But as middle age and disillusionment begin to close in on him, Cole needs a way out. He finds his salvation in a revolutionary new company, KORE Industries, which offers to perform a body switch on the businessman. Cole&#39;s mind and memories will be put into a younger body of his choosing, and a highly intelligent robot will be placed into his old body to keep up the appearance that Cole never left. To complete the body switch, KORE Industries chooses a revolutionary Computerized Soul by the name of Jared to occupy Cole&#39;s body while Cole is away. Cole vanishes into a life of anonymity, while Jared is left to wrestle with Cole&#39;s unraveling life. Despite Jared&#39;s best efforts, complications arise when his conscience conflicts with the callous lifestyle he is supposed to lead. As everything begins to spin out of control, Jared is faced with an impossible decision: to play things safe and ignore the consequences, or to risk his own existence in a wild gamble to set things right again." />
