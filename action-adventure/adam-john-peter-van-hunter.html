  <title>Adam John Peter - Van Hunter</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Yes, this is a journey! Adam, one of my grandsons, is the main character. He travels through time and space on a mystical tour of suffering and great joy. Life is not always easy for Adam. There are difficulties he must overcome. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you read and become part of this voyage, you too might recognize trials you must endure. Being a Christian is not easy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a real sense, this is a story of my reversion back to the faith. As a survivor of a very serious bout of acute lymphoblastic leukemia, I know the harsh reality of suffering. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the middle of it all, I realized that God was talking to me. He gave me the life-giving gift of cancer. It was a spiritual wake-up call. I thank God for it every day in my prayers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God works in mysterious ways. Keep your ears and your heart open. He is speaking to you at this very moment. Dont turn away. Come to know His great mercy and love He has for you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;May God bless and keep you.&lt;/p&gt;" />
