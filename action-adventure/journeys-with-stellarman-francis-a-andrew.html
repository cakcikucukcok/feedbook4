  <title>Journeys with Stellarman - Francis A. Andrew</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Astronomy has so often been seen as &#39;the poor man of science;&#39; that misperception however, is thankfully being dispelled as the great strides in scientific discoveries have served to engender an awareness of the close interlinkage between astronomical and terrestrial phenomena. One cannot understand the origin and nature of the Universe without knowledge of the advances currently being made in the field of sub-atomic physics - most especially with regard to the quest for the now not-so-elusive Higgs-Boson particle. Likewise, observation and study of the Universe allows scientists to work within the largest laboratory ever constructed - a laboratory given by nature and at zero cost, yet which provides the means for the study of sub-atomic phenomena at energies beyond what even the best of terrestrial laboratories can produce. It is within this context that Francis Andrew has written &quot;Journeys With Stellarman&quot; with the hope of encouraging the next generation of scientists not to eschew what can only turn out to be a highly rewarding lifetime&#39;s career in the astronomical sciences. 
Siddhant Bahuguna, India 
---------- 
Francis Andrew has written a truly unique form of book which blends science fiction with the factual data of the astronomical sciences. Its rich mix of fact and fantasy within a literary stylistic form of school-boy humour ensures that it entertains as much as it educates. I see no reason why this book should not be the means by which children are brought to a realisation that astronomy is truly a worthwhile career to pursue and a vocation that is equal to any other which one may care to name.
