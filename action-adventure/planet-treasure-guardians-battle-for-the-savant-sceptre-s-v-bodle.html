  <title>Planet Treasure Guardians : Battle for the Savant Sceptre - S.V. Bodle</title>
      <meta name="description" content="THRILLING FANTASY ready to captivate and inspire you. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Discover treacherous trouble and exhilarating escapades as you explore unknown worlds in this engrossing series. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
A  magical seed pod delivers strong power and gains more attention than Ladek and Robbie expect. Ladeks sister, Skyla and her friend Ashleigh join them on an exciting treasure hunt which evolves into a dangerous race to save Earth from a deadly conqueror or perish under their rule. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Confronting the Tanyaska Ladek is overpowered in a struggle for life which leads to his condemnation for a crime he didnt commit. With the quest in jeopardy and their parents trust destroyed, the friends must find a way to save the quest and overcome their fears while proving Ladeks innocence. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Masquerading as a science teacher, Mrs Scryvun and her bullying minion devise a ruthless trap for Ladek to weaken Earths defence, &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Ladek and his friends will need the help of a guide, Zonule, the planet treasures, and their quick wits, if they are going to secure the Savant Sceptre. But can Ladek gain his freedom and rally the guardians together in time to save the planet from disaster? &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
From escaping certain death, to facing their past and future, the four friends form a bond and discover the value of loyalty, trust, and family." />
