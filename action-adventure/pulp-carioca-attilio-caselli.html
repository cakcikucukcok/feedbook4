  <title>Pulp Carioca - Attilio Caselli</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Set within the chaotic and sensual background of Rio de Janeiro, the story describes the lives of several shocking, amazing and funny characters from different social classes, from the extremely shabby to the most opulent and rich, as they cross paths and confront themselves with life&#39;s miseries and glories.
Starting with the daring adventures of Du, the cocky favela boy who gets into bed with the beautiful Elza, mistress of the very dangerous Majò, and who will pay the consequences of his choice in a tragic and grotesque way. From Du we go on to the last day of Diego, a questionable politician and businessman who together with his team is planning, completely careless of laws and ethical rules, his election to the Brazilian presidency. And then Constanza, Diego&#39;s young and sophisticated wife, who spends her empty life full of anguish, smoking pot all day trying to forget her depression and who, because of this addiction, will end up in a police station where she will be forced to escape jumping out of a window and will fall down, without being seen by anyone, right on top of a cart full of rubber belonging to João Baptista dos Santos da Silva, a simple homeless man who earns his life collecting scrap material in the streets of Rio and who later discovers Constanza lying unconscious in the middle of his cart and thinks that she is Iemanjà, the goddess of the Sea, to whom he is very devoted. We will also meet Ricardo Machado, one of the few honest and loyal policemen in all of Rio, whose life is turned radically upside down by a desperate passion that will change him forever. And finally we will get to know Vanderley and Cleverson, two sextons of the Botafogo Cemetery in search of sordid adventures.
Fragments of lives that will all be joined together at the end during a triple funeral ceremony, leaving the reader with a reflection about the meaning of life." />
