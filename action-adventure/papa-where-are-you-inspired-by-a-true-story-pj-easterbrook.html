  <title>Papa, Where Are You?: inspired by a true story - PJ Easterbrook</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Betty and Julie are so excited to visit their grandmother&amp;rsquo;s large Victorian home while they await their Mama&amp;rsquo;s delivery of her third child. Life as they know it comes to an abrupt end, however, when Mama dies in childbirth. The baby girl survives and all three children remain at Grandmother&amp;rsquo;s house for a time until Papa can make provisions and decisions. After a year, a neighbor moves away with Papa and the older sisters. Eventually the sisters in 1926, alienated from their father, are placed in the Park Ridge School for Girls, with the neighbor lady portraying herself as a widow and their mother. Although promising to come back when she gets settled, two years pass. The girls settle in and keep their secrets as instructed. Eventually, the sisters become wards of the State of Illinois. Social workers and juvenile authorities are called in. Finally, the truth comes out. Once the legalities are settled and Papa has been looked for, to no avail, the girls are reunited with their Mama&amp;rsquo;s family. It&amp;rsquo;s a story of faith, resilience, and strength of two little girls.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;" />
