  <title>A Long Way Back - Mike Holst</title>
      <meta name="description" content="In the grip of a raging thunderstorm Arnie Bottelmiller, his small son Timmy, and his fiance Julie are forced down and crash land on an island in the wilderness area of Northern Minnesota. Arnie is badly injured and immobile. He and Julie, who is also injured but able to function, wait for rescue for a few days and then finally realize their only chance for survival is for Julie, Timmy and Jake the dog, to walk out. A trek of over eighty miles of sometimes impenetrable forest, with nothing more than the clothing on their backs, a fishing pole, a crude map and a lighter with very little fluid left. They have a strange and unnerving encounter with a wild timber wolf who proves to be their friend and not their enemy. A lot of emotions come out in the story, with family and friends holding vigils behind the scenes, unaware of Julie, Timmy and Jakes courageous fight for survival." />
