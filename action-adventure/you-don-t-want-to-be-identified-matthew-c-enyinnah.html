The first motive is that psychological fear that their informations will be distorted for another use . It may also be due to the acceptance  of  a giulty conscience , that originated  from some failure in self engagements , even in the absence  of  blames from others .

However , as  you go through the book , you will observe that the girl on the  front page Chwdi , really picked a boyfriend , called Zimz, who was not aware of the fact, because she reported to have had impediment , embarrassment and  trouble on the telephone number given to her by him
, for   a  period of  two years , by another lady , known as
Mrphngi , a neighbour to Zimz , who initially agreed to share her  fixed phone in the apartment with him . But at the beginning of the report , the lady denied the reality of such issue on the telephone , not withstanding that a post card was published to that effect. Eventually, the lady got unmask and successively confess the truth , as there was also another testimony in fovour of  the impediment and embarrassment that Chwdi had by then . The lady did plead to remain unknown over  what she has done or said on the issue, as she regret most of  the actions that she had already taken .

At the same time she was useful with her love , visits and informations , but latter quit from the relationship that she established with him  . When Mrphongi heard about  her final departure from Zimzs room , she tried to entice him into love making at 02, 00 after midnight , while expressing envy about Chwdi , but was rejected by him and she revenge with the request that he vacate the room he occupied in the apartment .
