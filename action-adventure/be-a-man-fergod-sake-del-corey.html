  <title>Be a Man Fergod Sake - Del Corey</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Ted Byrum decides to join the army and become a paratrooper.  Little did this 18 year old suspect the military world could be as cruel and demanding as he found it.  Not only was the leadership harsh, but the other recruits were people who would challenge his character, sometimes forcing and often helping him, to make decisions he was surprised he would ever take.
Ted&#39;s  father, a tough man that he looked up to, ordered him to &quot;Be a Man, Fergod Sake,&quot; and these words stuck with this young man entering a larger world than he&#39;d ever experienced.  So when, in basic training, this new private is pushed and bullied by a big tough guy named Timothy Murphy, that&#39;s his first challenge to &quot;be a man.&quot;
Meanwhile, when Ted learns of an attempted suicide of his father at home, it shakes up many of his beliefs and expectations.
This is followed by many cruelties and demands of the military, through 16 weeks of basic. and three weeks of jump school, where he encounters unnecessary beatings and deaths.  How Ted reacts to these and many other events all go to influence his becoming a Man." />
