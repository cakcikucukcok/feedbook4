  <title>Chamber of the Dragon&#39;s Soul - Thomas Everill</title>
      <meta name="description" content="What if everything you ever knew was a lie?   
                                                     Your whole life conjured by another? 
                                                 Would you know the truth if you saw it?
                                                      Could you believe the impossible? 
                                               Embrace a world just beyond your dreams
                                                        A place of mystery &amp; wonder..
John and Tom were lost in a world Tom felt was never their own.  Their peaceful secluded lives would become chaos in a flash of memories long buried in the mind of a child on the verge of an awakening.  Across the void, Lynkara must reach out to her brothers and bring them to an unimaginable homecoming on the eve of annihilation by the darkest powers her world has ever known. Together with a band of new found friends they must search out and acquire the twelve SWORDS OF POWER bestowed to the ruling families of all the countries on their world by the Creator himself. A few brave souls will join the quest to save themselves and their world from the coming darkness. However, Lord Camas of Jahanna refuses to give up his power and forges an unlikely alliance with Prince Reven of Amador. For a deadly price he will unleash his monstrous hordes upon the rest of the world. Together they will rage an unending war that will encompass the face of Astridia in chaos and bloodshed for years to come. With the uneasy alliance in place Lord Camas calls on the Dark magics of old and the Ancient dragon TOPHET, whose very name means Death. He was conjured by the black warlock Kemmal in the bowels of Hell itself to conquer the entire world." />
