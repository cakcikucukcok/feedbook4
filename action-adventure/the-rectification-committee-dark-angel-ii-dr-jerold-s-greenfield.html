  <title>The Rectification Committee: Dark Angel Ii - Dr. Jerold S. Greenfield</title>
      <meta name="description" content="In this book, Jarred has become the Chairman of the Rectification Committee. Jarred knew when he selected the Committee&#39;s members that the men had to be special, brave, and revengeful. These men came together to reach their ultimate goal: to bend the outcome of humanity. However, when Jarred unexpectedly morphs into a hybrid personality with supernatural powers that he didn&#39;t have in the first book, he is faced with difficult challenges. These powers and being the Chairman of the Rectification Committee have Jarred constantly struggling with the good and evil of his powers. But Jarred comes to find out that he&#39;s not the only one that have these unique powers. The book reflects his constant agony with his &quot;powers&#39; dilemma. The powers could not help Jarred or the Committee attain its goal for humanity. Instead, after the Committee&#39;s mission to Syria, the powers backfire terribly and Jarred is sadden by the events that unfolded. All Jarred wanted was to move closer to the fragrance of Christ and away from the stench of death. Through these difficult times, Jarred always found himself asking &quot;Why me, Lord? Why me?&quot; And God always responded, &quot;Don&#39;t worry about that now, Jarred.&quot;" />
