  <title>Red House - Kent Killmer</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Right-wing conservative and card-carrying member of the Silent Majority, Francis Scott Key is the shirttail relative of the national anthems author. A former SEAL and current venture capitalist in Menlo Park, California, Scotty becomes involved with Ali Woo, a beautiful NSA agent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scotty becomes suspicious when a Berkley grad who developed a way to revolutionize mining goes missing, and localized earthquakes in Canada and Mexico kill their prime minister and president. He teams up with a Royal Canadian Mountie to discover if these natural disasters are truly natural. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shortly after the deaths of the Mexican and Canadian officials, a cataclysmic 8.8 earthquake takes 242,000 lives in California. Are these events linked? A guessing game ensues as to the real entity pulling US President Rasheeds strings. What is the true motivation to rack up debt to the point of the countrys ruination? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From San Francisco to D.C., Vancouver, and Cozumel, Mexico, &lt;i&gt;Red House&lt;/i&gt; explores in humorously irreverent, gritty detail, the tipping points between treachery, incompetence and ideology against the backdrop of a rich international tapestry of intrigue. Is corruption or narcissistic megalomania driving the bus hurtling the US towards bankruptcy?&lt;/p&gt;" />
