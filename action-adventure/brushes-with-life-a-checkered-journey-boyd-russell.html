  <title>Brushes with Life-A Checkered Journey - Boyd Russell</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Is a persons essence shaped by self determination and direction oris it the amalgamation of the persons, places and events that shape the whole? In Brushes With Life  A Checkered Journey we are permitted to stand to the side of a mans life and watch the journey. In the end we can decide for ourselves which drives the processor, is it a contentious marriage of both.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;&lt;I&gt;Brushes With Life  A Checkered Journey&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;  introduces Shaun McKenzie, an entrepreneur on the other side of middle age, and chronicles his passage from childhood in Burma (Myanmar) to middle age in America. He is, for better or worse, a take-no-prisoners individual, a double-edged sword in our contemporary world. He moves easily and confidently through it, but is frequently the agent of flinty sparks which illuminate his relationships. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
The answer to our question requires the introduction of a cast of indelible characters, contributing influences to Shauns personal and professional life.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Among them are: &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;i&gt;John Ericson,&lt;/i&gt; a business antagonist, whose hostile intentions collide with Shaun&#39;s capitalistic flair and philosophy. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Mary McKenzie,&lt;/i&gt; his mother, a Northern Irish colleen, the rear guard of the family and the genteel force behind Shauns self reliance and determination  quiet, stronga lion in sheeps clothing. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Malcolm McKenzie,&lt;/i&gt; Shauns enigmatic father. He is a proud, distinctive man, a member of British intelligence in Burma during World War II. The separations marking their relationship leave Shaun stained by guilt and self-denial.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Maggie OConnell,&lt;/I&gt; Shauns Auntie Mame she challenges life, its participants, and existing protocols with equal portions of disregard and aplomb. Her assault on the dental profession gives new meaning to &lt;b&gt;painless&lt;/b&gt; dentistry.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Master Ne Win,&lt;/i&gt; Shauns childhood Martial Arts instructor. His ancient teachings combined with a flare for the impish mark Shaun with a yardstick for living. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Mickey Mason,&lt;/i&gt; a student to Shauns Pygmalion. She trades her employee status for intimate equality. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Jean Crimmins,&lt;/i&gt; a college lover. Shaun returns years later, attempting to heal the joint lesions left by his arrogance and conceit, but going back exacts an unexpected toll. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;" />
