  <title>Imprints of a Gazelle - Geoff Brooker</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Part travelogue, part thriller, and a story of maturing emotional relationships, Imprints of a Gazelle is the story of an unhappily married English couple who go to Morocco hoping to save their marriage whilst trying to aid an Algerian friend whose sister has eloped with a Bedouin. As they find themselves increasingly drawn into the dangerous and harsh reality of the desert, their marriage begins to unwind. Will they both reach safety, and will their marriage still be intact as they are hunted by the police whilst being chased through the desert by a psychopath? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This book will appeal to those who enjoy an exciting adventure story, those who enjoy travel books and those that are interested in relationships and interactions between men and women. Its theme is very much that of the study of a marriage and explores the value of being honest and open in relationships and letting partners know who you really are. &lt;/p&gt;" />
