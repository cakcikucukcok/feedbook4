  <title>Flagstaff Hill - James Enright</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Tommy O&#39;Hanlon is a promising high school cross-country runner. When a devastating chain of events is set in motion, Tommy is suddenly forced to deal with the deaths of both his parents. Tommy quickly comes to terms with his mother&#39;s accidental death, but his father&#39;s mysterious demise, in Glacier National Park, haunts him for years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Tommy decides to transfer to a rival high school to put at least one part of his painful past behind him, his troubles are only compounded. Through his unfortunate acquaintance with Lee Carter, a fellow runner, Tommy manages to make some strong enemies who patiently await the right time to exact their revenge. With the help of a wily cross-country coach and an understanding girlfriend, Tommy begins to train physically and mentally for the state cross-country championships, with results that only serve to fuel the rage of Carter-and his powerful father.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When it seems that he has finally gotten his life back on track, Tommy and his brother Bill begin training for the Olympic Trials Marathon. Tommy is unexpectedly implicated in the theft and subsequent use of performance-enhancing drugs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Will Tommy ever be able to overcome his tragic past?" />
