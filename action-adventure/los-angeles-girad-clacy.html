In the year 2020, the city of Los Angeles is targeted by a terrorist bearing the name Botan. For years, Botans people have infiltrated local, state and federal governments.  Botan had his chemical plants make ammonium nitrate, a Class A explosive. Add that to the fact that Botan had purchased abandoned mines in the California area that crosses the San Andreas Fault line. Botan threatens the western United States with a threat letter stating that if his demands are not met, catastrophic consequences will result. Let Girad Clacy take you on an action-packed excursion into law enforcement officers worst nightmare combating a terrorist on their own doorsteps." />
