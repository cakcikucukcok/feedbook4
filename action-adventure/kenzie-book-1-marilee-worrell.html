  <title>Kenzie Book 1 - Marilee Worrell</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Kenzie St. Clair has been trained since childhood to be the ultimate government operative. She performs her missions with uncanny skill, strength, and efficiency. She never fails. However, the price for this efficiency is that she has also been trained to suppress all emotion. As a result, there is no skill beyond Kenzie, except for the ability to have and express feelings.
Jeff Dwyer is a widower with five sons. He is a multibillionaire and the owner of the corporations Dwyer Industries and Sentry Technology. He runs this corporation as a cover for his other company, Global Relief, which secretly assists victims of natural disasters. Since the death of his wife over ten years ago, his entire life has been dedicated to his work.
By pure chance, one of Kenzies missions brings her to the heart of Global Relief where she and Jeff meet. Encountering Jeff stirs up feelings in Kenzie that she cannot understand or even identify. Jeffs feelings for Kenzie are instant and obvious, but he is unsure how to proceed with someone like Kenzie.
While Jeff and Kenzie learn to trust each other, and learn just how far their feelings for each other can go, they also have yet to learn that they have a common enemy. Cam Rowan is wealthy, powerful, and ruthless. He uses money and people to achieve his goals. Although he has dealt with Kenzie before, and would not hesitate to eliminate her if she gets in his way, his target right now is Global Relief.
Kenzie must now protect the lives of both herself and the Dwyers, while at the same time she faces a struggle within her own mind that could make her choose between her career as an operative and a possible future with a family." />
