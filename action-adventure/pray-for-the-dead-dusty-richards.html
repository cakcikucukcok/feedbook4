  <title>Pray for the Dead - Dusty Richards</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&quot;Dusty Richards writes&amp;#8230;with the flavor of the real West.&quot; --Elmer Kelton&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The American frontier comes alive in this blazing saga of Chet Byrnes and his family empire by Western Heritage and Spur award-winning author Dusty Richards&amp;#8230;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Between The Living And The Dead&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Byrnes family has fought fiercely for its ranching empire. And with success comes the fate of empires: The Brynes have taken in far-flung family members, hired hands and folks looking for another chance at life.&amp;#160;The Byrnes clan has taken their fair share of hurt, too, taking on outlaws too deadly and powerful for the law. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When a stage is robbed of a fortune in gold, the Byrnes boys set off on a wild race through the wilderness. But who are the men they are chasing? And where have they stashed the gold? In a harsh, unforgiving land, the Byrnes men face a mystery of gold and death--that could explode like a bomb in their hands... &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&quot;Dusty takes readers into the real west at full gallop.&quot; --&lt;i&gt;New York Times &lt;/i&gt; bestselling author Jodi Thomas" />
