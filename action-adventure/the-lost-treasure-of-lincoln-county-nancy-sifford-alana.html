  <title>The Lost Treasure of Lincoln County - Nancy Sifford Alana</title>
      <meta name="description" content="A Great American Adventure  The Lost Treasure of Lincoln County is a childrens historical fiction for older children and adults that promotes pride in America.  The spirit of patriotism is weaved throughout the adventures of two boys, Jonas and Dale, who find an old wooden box that contains a treasure map.  With the help of a local historian, the boys find the treasure.  The contents of the treasure teach the boys about the Siefert/Sifford family who immigrated to America in 1753 from Germany.  The story takes place in Lincolnton, North Carolina, in 1958 and ends when the boys return from the Viet Nam War in the early 1970s.
     The novel teaches about the history of the American flag, how to fold a flag, and why a flag is positioned at half-staff.  This novel promotes respect for our military men and women both in the present and in the past.
     A section at the end of the book helps the reader know if the information in the book is fact or fiction.  The Great Pennsylvania Wagon Road, the U. S. Mint in Charlotte, NC, the Lincolnton flood of 1916, and the Battle at Ramsour&#39;s Mill are mentioned in the story.  
     The book contains a family tree that begins with Joachim Siefert and ends with John F. Sifford and other family history information." />
