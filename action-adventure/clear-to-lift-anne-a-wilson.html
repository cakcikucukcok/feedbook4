  <title>Clear to Lift - Anne A. Wilson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Full of action and adventure, dangerous and heart-stopping rescues, blizzards and floods, family secrets and second chances, &lt;i&gt;Clear to Lift&lt;/i&gt; by Anne A. Wilson is a thrilling woman&#39;s journey as she finds confidence, truth, love, and herself against the majestic backdrop of the Sierra Nevada. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Navy helicopter pilot Lt. Alison Malone has been assigned to a search and rescue team based at Naval Air Station Fallon, Nevada, near the rugged peaks of the Sierra Nevada, and far from her former elite H-60 squadron. A rule follower by nature, Alison is exasperated and outraged every time she flies with her mission commander, &quot;Boomer&quot; Marks, for whom military procedures are merely a suggestion. Alison is desperate to be transferred out of the boonies, where careers stagnate, and back to her life and fiancé in San Diego.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alison&#39;s defenses start to slip when she meets mountain guide Will Cavanaugh during a particularly dicey mission. Will introduces her to a wild, beautiful world of adventure that she has never known before. Stranded on a mountain during a sudden dangerous blizzard, Alison questions every truth she thought she knew about herself. When Will braves the storm to save her life, she must confront the fact that she has been living a lie. But is it too late to change course?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the Publisher&#39;s request, this title is being sold without Digital Rights Management Software (DRM) applied.&lt;/p&gt;" />
