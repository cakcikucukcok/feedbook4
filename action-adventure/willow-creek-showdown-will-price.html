  <title>Willow Creek Showdown - Will Price</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P ALIGN=&quot;JUSTIFY&quot;&gt;Hawk knew all about death and trouble, and thats why he was a loner.  He had a quick smile, a fast gun and a horse that had sense enough to turn its rear to the wind in a storm.  He was a smart horse and that was more that he could say for some humans he had met lately.  They all seemed to have one thought on their minds and that was attending his funeral and if a popularity poll was taken, it looks like he would have to hire pallbearers.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P ALIGN=&quot;JUSTIFY&quot;&gt;In 1863, Bloody Bill Anderson and his outlaws stopped a westbound train just outside Centralia, Missouri. They stole the strongbox, which contained three thousand dollars, and executed twenty-five Union Soldiers.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P ALIGN=&quot;JUSTIFY&quot;&gt;Hawk remembered his two brothers who were killed that day.  As a small boy he tried in vain to comfort his mother who died a few months later of a broken heart.  It was that day in the churchyard that he swore on his mothers grave that he would get revenge.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P ALIGN=&quot;JUSTIFY&quot;&gt;Now his time had come and the trail of these killers had lead him to Frank James and Bob Ford and a question he may not live long enough to answer.  Why was it that everyone who knew about the agreement between the Ford Brothers and the James Brothers, committed suicide, died mysteriously, or was murdered?&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P ALIGN=&quot;JUSTIFY&quot;&gt;Hawk knew he would have to find the answer to that question or die trying.&lt;/P&gt;
