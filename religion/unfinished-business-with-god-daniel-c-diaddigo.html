  <title>Unfinished Business…  with God - Daniel C. Diaddigo</title>
      <meta name="description" content="If God exists, where is he in all of this pain? This is one of the most pressing questions in life. If you wish a biblical perspective on this question, I recommend Dans book. 
&lt;p&gt;Walt Henrichsen, author and mentor to men 
&lt;p&gt;This book will inspire, encourage and challenge you on your journey. 
&lt;p&gt;David H. Wills, President National Christian Foundation 
&lt;p&gt;Dan uses his personal journey and engaging stories to sort through lifes most challenging moments. In the process, he exposes our conflict with God and our opportunity for healing. 
&lt;p&gt;Ron Dun, co-CEO of Alliance Flooring
&lt;p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This story has a Center and its not me. Im a fringe player in a larger drama that changed the lives of a handful of people forever. 
&lt;p&gt;Stories like this happen every day; so in a sense, this story is not unique - but it is personal. 
&lt;p&gt;Very personal. 
&lt;p&gt;Tragedy is always personal to someone. 
&lt;p&gt;Thats why I wrote this book. 
&lt;p&gt;Ive done my best here to give you a window into one mans thoughts toward God during a season when God didnt make sense. It is my prayer for you that these pages will serve you well in your own journey, and that God would somehow reach through the words to draw you to Himself. 
&lt;p&gt;You may not find in this book the answers to your questions, but you will find permission to process your pain out loud and encouragement to finish your business with God.
