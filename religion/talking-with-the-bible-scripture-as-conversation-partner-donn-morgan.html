  <title>Talking with the Bible: Scripture as Conversation Partner - Donn Morgan</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The Bible is full of sound and fury-just like the world that looks to it for answers. It is also a powerful resource for understanding and moving beyond conflict. Talking with the Bible helps readers understand how and why we have conversations with the Bible in our communities of faith. There is no one way to talk with the Bible and no one way the Bible talks to us. Rather, there are a number of differing, sometimes contradictory ways in which we understand the Bible in conversation and as a dialogue partner. Through studying scripture, together and alone, we can become more sensitive and adept at listening to and understanding one another.  The accompanying study guide contains a series of texts and questions intended to provoke thought and discussion about talking with the Bible." />

Over the years I've responded to what the Bible says by writing in margins, underlining verses, and taking notes, but Donn Morgan takes the idea of conversing with God's word to a whole new level.<br /><b><i>Talking with the Bible: Scripture as Conversation Partner ...</i></b> | Talking with the Bible is a prerequisite for integrating the Bible into our lives. Most of us have heard a voice of scripture. Sometimes it is a part of positive experiences associated with concepts and language like "love" or "wisdom" or "salvation," or even "judgment" or "sin" (especially if the concepts seem appropriate for those with whom we disagree).<br /><p><h3 align="left">Download Ebook|PDF|Epub of <a href=>Talking with the Bible: Scripture as Conversation Partner - Donn Morgan</a> </h3></p><hr/>
