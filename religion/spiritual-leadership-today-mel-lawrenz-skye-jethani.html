  <title>Spiritual Leadership Today - Mel Lawrenz, Skye Jethani</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&quot;If you are in a position of positive influence, if you exercise leadership in any way, your faith in God gives you a power&amp;mdash;a hidden power&amp;mdash;that will allow you to make an enduring difference in the lives of other people and organizations. But how does that power work?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;So says Mel Lawrenz in this fresh look at leadership which offers practical and biblical guidance to believers who want to have a deep influence and who want to know: What is the proper use of authority and power? Where do good ideas come from? How can we deal with failure? What does God expect of us?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;Drawing from more than thirty years of experience in pastoral ministry, Lawrenz writes for Christians in any position of influence. This book provides a new baseline for 21st century Christian leadership, addressing issues such as:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;bull; building integrity&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;bull; seizing opportunities&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;bull; exploring new horizons&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;bull; speaking into crises&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;bull; receiving power&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;bull; accepting authority&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;bull; promoting truth&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;bull; managing expectations&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;bull; dealing with criticism&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;Using real-life examples, key Scripture passages, and history, Lawrenz shows that when believers align their responsibility to lead with the teaching of Jesus and the work of God&amp;rsquo;s Spirit, their spiritual influence will have integrity and enduring effectiveness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&quot;Lawrenz gives us hope that the leadership pendulum which has swung from &#39;over- spiritualized&#39; to &#39;de-spiritualized&#39; in recent generations may have finally come to rest where it always belonged&amp;mdash;upon Jesus Christ.&quot; - Skye Jethani, Senior Editor, Leadership Journal, from the foreword&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&quot;It is exciting to think about believers at every level of society rising to a new call to exercise powerful spiritual influence. In his newest book Mel Lawrenz has given us all a new baseline for leadership that is personal, wise, and spiritual. It spans the generations and reaches across cultures. Just think what will happen if believers in positions of influence tie into the wisdom and the power that comes from God in order to bring restoration in our broken world!&amp;rdquo; - Mark Batterson, Lead Pastor, National Community Church in Washington, D.C.&lt;/p&gt;" />
