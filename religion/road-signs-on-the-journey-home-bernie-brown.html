  <title>Road Signs on the Journey Home - Bernie Brown</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;This is an intriguing and inspiring collection of devotionals based on messages gleaned from signs along the roads we travel. It can be meaningful to adults, fascinating to children, and even helpful to youth learning to drive. Each message is supported by words of wisdom from the ancient Book of Proverbs. If we will just slow down and observe, even something as seemingly mundane as a road sign can convey a powerful lesson. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mr. Brown, in the future, I would appreciate it if you would pay attention to them (road signs) and act accordingly. As he handed me the ticket, he said, Have a good day.  &lt;br&gt;
&lt;i&gt;North Carolina State Trooper&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; My goodness, Bernie, this is amazing. Never thought of this  but it is simple and profound. We can see road signs differently after reading your devotionals. The pictures are wonderful, too  and Proverbs come alive in a new way.  &lt;br&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Lucy Adams, Author and Cofounder of the Western NC Christian Writers Fellowship&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Our city, like others, devotes a tremendous amount of resources toward placing directional and informational signs along its streets for guidance and to insure the publics safety. It is amazing how Bernie Brown has extracted additional meaning from many of these road signs to assist each of us on our individual lifes journey. This fascinating little book will not only inspire you but will assist you in passing your spiritual drivers license test. &lt;br&gt;
