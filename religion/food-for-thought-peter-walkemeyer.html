  <title>Food for Thought - Peter Walkemeyer</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Food for Thought is a collection of studies or devotions designed to feed the believer and give them something to think about. It takes the reader on a journey through the scriptures, touching on many aspects of the Christian Life. Food for Thought aims to motivate and call forth the best qualities in the reader; to challenge them to a deeper devotion to Christ, greater faith and a life of moral excellence.
Food for Thought Book One contains ninety individual studies that can be used as daily devotions, connect group studies, or personal study guides. The studies are designed to feed the reader the Word and stimulate their thinking so that they spend time meditating in the Word, digesting it and gaining their own revelation.
Each daily study uses the basic structure (SOAP): scripture, observation, application, and prayer. In this manner, the reader gets to read a passage or several passages of scripture. They are provided with some commentary on the scripture they have read, the application of the scripture for daily living is expounded, and there is a Word-based prayer that can be used and meditated on during the day." />
