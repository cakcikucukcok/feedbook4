  <title>Sex, Lies, and the Truth: Developing a Christian Ethic in a Post-Christian Society - Linda L. Belleville</title>
      <meta name="description" content="We are in the midst of a rapidly changing sexual scene. Casual sex between consenting adults scarcely gets a second look, marriage is increasingly viewed as an at-will contract, attitudes toward same-sex relationships have done an about-face, and the family has been redefined in ways that challenge how we effectively minister to those inside and the church. If we as believers value our call to be the salt and light of society, then we must begin to think biblically and strategically about how to engage our sexually volatile culture. Sex, Lies, and the Truth aims to help Christians in all walks of life do just that: It addresses the question of how to develop a Christian ethic in an increasingly post-Christian society by becoming biblically informed and culturally conversant with a topic that promises to be one of the foremost challenges the church will face in the coming years." />
