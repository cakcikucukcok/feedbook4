  <title>Imaging the Story: Rediscovering the Visual and Poetic Contours of Salvation - Karen Case-Green, Gill Cudmore Sakakini</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&quot;Tell all the Truth but tell it slant.&quot; (Emily Dickinson) This course follows the contours of the salvation story through the lens of the arts. Putting visual art and poetry in conversation with the Bible, it seeks to engage the imagination. Rather than analyzing the narrative, the reader is invited to behold it and respond to it through &quot;making&quot;--either verbally or visually. At times, the church has treated the imagination like an embarrassing relative. Yet the Bible is image-rich, drawing widely on the imagination, and we are each made in the image of the creator God. It is time to bring the imagination out of the corner! &quot;For we are God&#39;s handiwork, created in Christ Jesus to do good works, which God prepared in advance for us to do.&quot; (Eph 2:10 NIV) Whether following it as a group or reading it alone, this course book will appeal to anyone with an interest in the salvation story and the arts. It is particularly for those who feel permission is needed to pick up a paintbrush--or any other creative medium--just for the love of it." />
