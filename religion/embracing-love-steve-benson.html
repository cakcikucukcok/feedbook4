  <title>Embracing Love - Steve Benson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Have you felt confused and isolated in relationships?&lt;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Have you felt lost in conflicted relational chaos?&lt;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do you feel an emotional disconnection between you, others, and God?&lt;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If so, keep reading  &lt;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Embracing Love invites us to explore what it means to love others well, live beyond fear, and embrace an authentic life. Through the authors personal story and those of others, we will understand the intricacies of giving and receiving love. This book is for those who are tired of hiding, willing to risk being exposed, and desiring to be transformed by Gods embracing love. Embracing Love dares you to discover the other side of just living in loveless, chaotic, and disconnected relationships.&lt;p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;I heartily recommend Embracing Love to you. Steves content immediately connects with my world. I was informed by his insight and comforted by his grace as he opened these subjects.&lt;p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;	Rev. Dr. Mike Moses, lead pastor of Lake Forest Church and board member and adjunct faculty at Gordon Conwell Theological Seminary&lt;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Steve Benson leaves no stone unturned, and you will marvel at how deeply he makes you look into your soul as you begin the process of seeing yourself, your spouse, and God in a complete and loving light. Embracing Love is a book that opens you up to giving as well as receiving lifes greatest giftlove.&lt;p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;	Coach Mike Sherman, former Green Bay Packers head coach&lt;p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Embracing Love is full of insightful discoveries of relational problem solving through a biblical filter. It had my attention from the beginning to the end.&lt;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;	John Schlitt, singer, songwriter, and lead vocalist for the Christian rock band Petra&lt;/p&gt;" />
