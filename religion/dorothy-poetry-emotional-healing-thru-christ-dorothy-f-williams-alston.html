I wanted to just yell, but who would hear me? Poetry was my way of letting others who were suffering as I knowing that no matter that God requests what you have or dont have, you need to press on.I had twelve weak evil spirits inside. Now my confidential blood lamb runs victory daily.
My book helped me afraid, trembled, and annoyed and fearless reassurance lifted my spirits. Helpful are firm and worthy goals, beliefs and wishes those achievement wet and day seasons. Moreover, I wanted realize some times if I answerability the reasons for mistakes. I do inner pain is inside my book and reading over all over again.

What you are about to read is my story, and through it I hope you will accept that there is only one creator. And his spirit and energy lives within us all." />
