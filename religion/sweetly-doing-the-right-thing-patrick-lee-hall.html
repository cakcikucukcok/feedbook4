We start the learning process by reading the words of God from the Holy Scriptures.  But, sometimes when we read them we dont understand them as clearly as we should.  This is where we should acquire helps How shall they hear without a preacher?  A preacher rightly divides the word of truth using simple language and simple lessons.

Read about the leadership of Moses, and Joshuas courage.  Read about the righteousness of Noah that saved mankind through the Grace of God.  Read about Abrahams servant and his faith and understanding and how he was able to draw out a spring-full of blessings.  Read and learn about the teachings of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ and about the acceptance of a widows offering.  Find out just who you are accountable to and why.  Feel the love of God and the compassion of Christ and tell your friends about it.  Discover what occupation you should be doing, and why we work.  Listen and hear God speaking to you and how you will become successful.  Learn how to be an encourager like Jonathan.  Read about how respect is won through honesty.  Understand what you should do when faced with a hopeless situation concerning your health.  Gather strength and learn to sing psalms, when there is no strength left inside of you.  Build solid foundations and find rest in the wilderness.  Discover why we help the poor and the  needy and finally this book will teach you to fear God and praise Him.  All of these righteous things will be taught to you from characters and stories, and passages of scripture and no doubt about it, you too, will be sweetly doing the right thing, even in Heaven someday." />
