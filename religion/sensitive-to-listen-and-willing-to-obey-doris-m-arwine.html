  <title>Sensitive to Listen and Willing to Obey - Doris M. Arwine</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;God uses people daily to communicate His fragrance and message to us. Too often we dont check to see what aroma or impression we are leaving for others to see, hear, or smell. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After visiting someones home or before checking out of a motel, or when moving, we double check to make sure we havent left anything behind. Even criminals check to make sure they havent left any clues at the crime scene to identify them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A story reminded me of this. A robber thought he had committed the perfect crime. He assumed he left no clues behind. But he didn&#39;t count on someone remembering how he smelled. The smell he left behind was what helped convict him. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, we leave something everywhere we go. Stuart Holden reminded a young man moving from a boarding house of this fact when the young man said, he was just double checking to make sure he wasn&#39;t leaving anything behind. Theres one thing you will leave behind, young man, your influence.&lt;/p&gt;" />
