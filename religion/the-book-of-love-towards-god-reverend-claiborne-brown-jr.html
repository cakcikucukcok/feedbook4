  <title>The Book of Love Towards God - Reverend Claiborne Brown Jr.</title>
      <meta name="description" content="One day, while watching a television show that featured the Rapper DMX, Reverend Claiborne Brown heard him quote a poem: These are hands of a man that steals; these are hands of a man that kills; these are the hands of a man that does; now fold them, the hands of a man that was. The poem DMX quoted revealed how he lived his life on the streets, but Reverend Brown prayed and asked the Lord to bless him with a poem that would bless the world. And so the Lord blessed him with a poem called Second Chance Prayer:
&lt;center&gt;&lt;i&gt;Lord, as I kneel down to pray; 
I asked the Lord today,
To give me a second chance to make it all the way.
I know I have lied, and spoke many untruths,
But, Lord give me a second chance 
to make it up to you.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;i&gt;The Book of Love towards God&lt;/i&gt; presents a series of poems by Rev. Brown inspired by the Bible, intended to enlighten and uplift with the Holy Spirits divine power." />
