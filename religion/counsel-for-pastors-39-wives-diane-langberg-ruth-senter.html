  <title>Counsel for Pastors&#39; Wives - Diane Langberg, Ruth Senter</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;Dr. Diane Langberg, a licensed psychologist, offers sympathetic and realistic answers to fourteen questions from pastors&#39; wives, questions that are often asked. In answering the questions Dr. Langberg addresses not only the particular women who asked them, but also those who are looking in over the shoulders of these women. Some of the answers are simpler than others. All of the answers require acts of faith, renewed patience, and wisdom that must come from God. With these divine resources come healing and possible solutions. Counsel for Pastors&#39; Wives is a good prescription for people who want to be helped and healed and for people who want to help the healing. It is not merely for pastor&#39;s wives, it is for concerned laypeople as well.&lt;/P&gt;" />
