  <title>New Horizon in Male-Female Relationships - David Samuel Green, Sandra E. McDermott</title>
      <meta name="description" content="New Horizon in Male-Female Relationships attempts to break new ground in the discourse on gender equality, love, happiness, and marriage. Author David Samuel Green succeeds admirably and wastes no time in tracing the evolution of human relationships. But he also puts forward new theories regarding the state of relations between males and females across the globe, including married couples.  What Green&#39;s new book further accomplishes lies in its no-holds-barred exploration of matters of the heart. Specifically, the author examines methods we can employ to eliminate problems that tend to hamper our relationships, and shows us how best to get the most out of our unions, with emphasis on how product thinking and egalitarianism assist remarkably.  Besides offering solutions for troubled marriages and other relationships, the book also extols several concepts that go hand in hand with love and happiness. At the same time, it becomes clear that if we want our unions and partnerships to work, we have to bring the right attitude to the table. After all, as we learn, the ingredients for a successful relationship must include compassion, forgiveness, and understanding." />
