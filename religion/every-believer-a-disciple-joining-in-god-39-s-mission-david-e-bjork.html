  <title>Every Believer a Disciple!: Joining in God&#39;s Mission - David E. Bjork</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The growth of Christianity in recent decades has been remarkable, but has it been growth with depth? Are our communities of faith, our churches, creating and nurturing deeply committed followers of Jesus? This book was born out of the realization that churches throughout the world, despite their numerous evangelization and spiritual development activities, are struggling to produce true disciples of Jesus.  How can we explain why so many of us in our churches are so unlike Jesus in the way we think and act? What can we change in our understanding and practices to facilitate life transformation and spiritual multiplication? And as Christians what are we called to do? In answering these questions the author proposes an alternative ecclesial and missional paradigm, that will enable us to better equip and mobilize believers in the mission that Christ gave to his disciples and gives to us all, to make disciples!" />
