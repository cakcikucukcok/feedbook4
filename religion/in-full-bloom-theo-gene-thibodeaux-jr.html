  <title>In Full Bloom - Theo Gene Thibodeaux Jr.</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;We hold close to our hearts many things, for some it is our religious practice, I encourage all to practice with such an intensity and focus that one day they will no longer have to practice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Christian churches teach the ultimate reward of heavenwhere one spends eternity in the presence of Godcan be procured by righteous actions preformed while living here on earth. Its the concept of being a good boy or girl, and you will be rewarded in the sweet bye and bye. Yet in the Bible, Christ speaks of the kingdom of God being at hand and that the presence of God is within. If these words are true, why are we so discombobulated by the process of life itself?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Author Theo Gene Thibodeaux Jr. sought to answer that question and to experience God directly in his lifetime. In Full Bloom is the story of his journey to find the answer in an orthodox system, namely the Catholic Church, the church he was born into. Each chapter of this often-humorous and strikingly personal story shares glimpses into the authors rediscovery of himself. Learn how after years of study, fasting, church attendance, and prayer, Thibodeaux was rewarded with Christ consciousness, a state of absolute rest, where there are no thoughts and one is able to act without being influenced by action. It is a life in full bloom.&lt;/p&gt;" />
