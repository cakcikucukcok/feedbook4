  <title>The Righteous Judgment of God: Aspects of Judgment in Paul&#39;s Letters - John R. Coulson, Michael Bird</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This book seeks to fill a gap on the important topic of God&#39;s judgment. It is written for Christians who desire to have a biblical worldview that helps them to live faithfully for Jesus Christ. It investigates what the apostle Paul has to say in his letters about God&#39;s judgment. The worldview that emerges is one that must not be ignored: of judgment as fundamental to our human life as Adam&#39;s descendants, of God&#39;s judgment at work in the world today, and of the final judgment as the certain future for every person. At the center is the decisive judgment of our sin in Christ at the cross, which is God&#39;s answer to our judgment problem. For each of these four aspects of judgment, key questions are considered, with the central question being, &quot;How do we live in the light of this truth?&quot;" />
