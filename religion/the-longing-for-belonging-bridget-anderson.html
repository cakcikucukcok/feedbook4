No matter the reason you are feeling alone, Bridgets story will impart immense hope into your spirit. After being relentlessly and patiently pursued by a mysterious God she spent much of her life avoiding, Bridget heard the soul-soothing truth she shares on these pages: the longing for belonging can only be filled when you know the one you belong to. &lt;br /&gt;
In this lighthearted, thought-provoking account, the reader will come to know what God is saying to each of us: I was there then. I am here now.&lt;/p&gt;" />
