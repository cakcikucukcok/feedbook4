  <title>But That&#39;s Not What It Says! - Roger Talley</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Preachers and evangelists all have a story to tell.    Atheists, of course, will reject the story, since it is founded on a belief they do not share:  the existence of a powerful, personal God.  Still, some of those will want to engage in conversation. This book provides them with some useful points of contrast to the usual evangelist narrative: if you are going to make claims about the Bible, make them about the whole Bible, not just the parts you want to talk about.    Skeptics, whether secular or religious (as in, from a different Christian denomination) may want to test the assertions and logic of the evangelist&#39;s narrative, and offer alternatives to it.  This book intends to help you with that.    In short, this book is about taking the Bible at its word:  &quot;Do not despise the words of prophets, but test everything; hold fast to what is good; abstain from every form of evil.&quot;  (1 Thessalonians 5:20-22)" />
