  <title>The Revelatory Text: Interpreting the New Testament as Sacred Scripture, Second Edition - Sandra  M. Schneiders</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this new edition of her major study of the New Testament, Sandra Schneiders proposes a comprehensive hermeneutical theory for New Testament interpretation, which takes full account of the Bible as both sacred Scripture and as a historical-literary classic. Designed to spur reflection on the role of Scripture as revelatory text in the life of the Church and in the lives of individual believers, &lt;i&gt;The Revelatory Text&lt;/i&gt; shows that an integral hermeneutical theory can ground a transformational hermeneutical praxis to make the biblical text available as a faith resource to the oppressed as well as to the privileged.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Schneiders investigates the meaning of the theological claim that the Bible is the Word of God&quot; and the &quot;Church&#39;s book,&quot; along with the implications of these claims for biblical interpretation. She then examines the historical, literary, and religious-spiritual dimensions of the New Testament, highlighting the implications for interpretation theory and methodology, and concludes by putting her theory to the test in a feminist interpretation of John 4.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The author argues that the comprehensive object of biblical interpretation is not merely information but transformation. She suggests that an adequate hermeneutical theory must include a wide range of exegetical and critical methods within a theologically and philosophically adequate understanding of Scripture as sacred text. She writes specifically to educated believers who wonder how sound biblical criticism can be incorporated into a faith- filled reading of the New Testament; biblical scholars who struggle with the question of whether or how faith can function legitimately in biblical scholarship; and those whose task it is to teach and preach the faith that looks to the New Testament as source and norm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chapters are &quot;The Problem and Project of New Testament Interpretation,&quot; &quot;The New Testament as Word of God,&quot; &quot;The New Testament as the Church&#39;s Book,&quot; &quot;The World Behind the Test: History, Imagination, and the Revelatory Text,&quot; &quot;The World of the Text: Witness, Language, and the Revelatory Text,&quot; &quot;The World Before the Text: Meaning, Appropriation, and the Revelatory Text,&quot; and &quot;A Case Study: Feminist Interpretation of John 4:1- 42.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;i&gt;Sandra M. Schneiders, IHM, is professor of New Testament studies and Christian spirituality at the Jesuit School of Theology and the Graduate Theological Union in Berkeley, California.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&quot;&lt;/div&gt;" />
