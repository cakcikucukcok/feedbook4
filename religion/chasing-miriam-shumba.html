      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Chasing: A Novel&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Miriam has written another unforgettable story that takes you from Zimbabwe to the United States.( Parade Magazine)&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The third novel from Miriam Shumba, whose two other novels have been known to keep people up all night reading comes her new, incredibly tantalizing novel that Dr. Stem has called, &amp;quot;A heart-felt, wise, honest, and tender book&amp;quot;. Chasing is an inspirational fiction about the meaning of life. If you want a story that leaves you unchanged, unbothered, then this is not for you. You will be simultaneously challenged and entertained as you delve deeply into the lives of Blake Pieri and Chenai Muvhumi, two strangers from different parts of the world who are thrown together by events beyond their control. Blake Pieri thought he had his life under control until his world begins to fall apart. His wife is killed in a car accident. Two years later, his teenage daughter resents him and he has no time for his son as he tries to save his company from unscrupulous business practices and wrong choices. Blake&amp;#39;s mother intervenes from afar and finds help in the form of a young student who is also escaping from tragedy in her home country of Zimbabwe. Immediately, Blake is suspicious of this foreigner and is determined to discredit her beliefs even as his curiosity about her God is awoken. Can Blake give in to the gentle probing of the spirit or is he content to remain on the road to destruction with no end in sight (with only heartbreak and loss at the end? Have the resentments and sense of abandonment frozen him forever? As the clashes between Chenai and Blake resonate throughout the book, it is now a matter of racing against time as he has to choose the right war, the one for his company or the battle of the soul.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;" />
