  <title>The Prerequisite for Wisdom: the Fear of the Lord - Charles S. Waller</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p align=&quot;left&quot;&gt;The text before you is an effort by the author to identify the reasons why counseling fails. He judged through his experience that too many counselees were simply walking away from counseling. They stated there had been no growth, or change, only dissatisfaction with their &quot;life in Christ.&quot; Thus, there seemed to be a &quot;missing&quot; ingredient. Following a study of the principal themes of Proverbs the author become certain about what was lacking. He determined that his clients were working without The Fear of the Lord.&quot; Their approach lacked a sincere reverence for God and few desired to make Him preeminent. Thus failure was certain. &quot;The Fear of the Lord&quot; is the means by which wisdom, knowledge and understanding is bestowed; humility is gained and true charity becomes the practice of the Believers life. Not until one truly makes God preeminent does real, biblical change: sanctification, satisfaction and true joy, become possible.&lt;/p&gt;" />
