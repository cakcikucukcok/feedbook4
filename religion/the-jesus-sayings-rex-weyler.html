  <title>The Jesus Sayings - Rex Weyler</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Jesus never said he was the son of God, he made no mention of the devil, and he didn&#39;t instruct his followers to wait for their reward in the eternal afterlife. Today, many people are shocked by these sober conclusions of modern biblical scholarship. So what did Jesus teach?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Social historian Rex Weyler uncovers the mystery surrounding the historical Jesus, whose voice and words have been distorted by centuries of revision. By examining the research of international Bible scholars and some 200 competing ancient sources, including the recent discovery of the extraordinary Gospels of Thomas and Mary, Weyler recreates the life of Jesus and his legacy, from the Roman Empire to our present age, and offers a fresh and provocative view of Jesus&#39; message and his mission.&lt;/p&gt;" />
