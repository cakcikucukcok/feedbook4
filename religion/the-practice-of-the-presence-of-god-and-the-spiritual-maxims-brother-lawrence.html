  <title>The Practice of the Presence of God and The Spiritual Maxims - Brother Lawrence</title>
      <meta name="description" content="“The Practice of the Presence of God” is a compilation of letters and records of conversations with 17th-century Carmelite monk Brother Lawrence compiled by his contemporary, Father Joseph de Beaufort. An influential work of Christian spirituality “The Practice” describes Brother Lawrence’s philosophy that a relationship with God is more important than the service and work done in God’s name. Brother Lawrence focuses on seeing the love of God, his presence, in all aspects of daily life. In this short work an attempt is made to explain Lawrence’s method of acquiring this presence of God. According to Brother Lawrence it is only in acquiring this presence that one truly can have a relationship with God. Also included in this work is “The Spiritual Maxims”, a collection of thoughts intended to give daily inspiration and guidance towards living a more spiritual life. Together these classic works of Christian devotion give great insight into the life and spiritual philosophy of Brother Lawrence." />
