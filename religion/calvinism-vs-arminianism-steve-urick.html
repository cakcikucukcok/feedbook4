  <title>Calvinism Vs. Arminianism - Steve Urick</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Within Protestant Christianity there has been a great debate going on for over 400 years between what is know as Calvinism and Arminianism. This disagreement has caused much division between many Christians and churches, with no end in sight. Furthermore, many in each camp refuse to concede the possibility that any point of their theology is wrong. 
Calvinism vs. Arminianism examines these two soteriological (study of salvation) systems in light of the Bible by using literal-grammatical methods of interpretation and scripture comparison. It rejects the notion that God&#39;s Word can contradict itself, thus cannot be understood by Christians at certain points. 
If you are wondering what each view teaches, or are confused by either one, this concise book will help answer your questions and clear up any confusion you might have. It may even help to bring about a greater unity amongst Christians, based on the Word of God." />
