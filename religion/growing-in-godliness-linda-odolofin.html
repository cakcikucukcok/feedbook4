  <title>Growing in Godliness - Linda Odolofin.</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Growing in Godliness: Journeying with Christ is an inspirational book that will help Christians, as well as anyone else, to know Jesus Christ more and establish a personal relationship with Him. This book hopes to help people understand how to grow in godliness and help them in their everyday lives with Christ. This book contains situations from my life and how I was (and still am) able to overcome them with God holding my hand throughout lifes journeys and storms.
I pray this book inspires you! I know how difficult it can be walking this journey, it is a narrow path, it can be hard but lets concentrate on the end result, it leads to life (Matthew 7:13). Things (as in ungodliness, addictions, struggles etc.) may seem hard to stop or get out of, even impossible, but once the Holy Spirit comes upon you, the things of the world you used to love, you will love no more! But we must repent and trust in Jesus Christ! Ask God for His wonderful spirit to live and dwell inside of you. I pray for us all that we will become who God created us to be, to please Him, as we go through life with Him." />
