  <title>Commentary on the Torah - Richard Elliott Friedman</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;In this groundbreaking and insightful new commentary, one of the world&#39;s leading biblical scholars unveils the unity and continuity of the Torah for the modern reader. Richard Elliott Friedman, the bestselling author of &lt;em&gt;Who Wrote the Bible?,&lt;/em&gt; integrates the most recent discoveries in biblical archaeology and research with the fruits of years of experience studying and teaching the Bible to illuminate the straightforward meaning of the text -- &quot;to shed new light on the Torah and, more important, to open windows through which it sheds its light on us.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While other commentaries are generally collections of comments by a number of scholars, this is a unified commentary on the Torah by a single scholar, the most unified by a Jewish scholar in centuries. It includes the original Hebrew text, a new translation, and an authoritative, accessibly written interpretation and analysis of each passage that remains focused on the meaning of the Torah as a whole, showing how its separate books are united into one cohesive, all-encompassing sacred literary masterpiece. This landmark work is destined to take its place as a classic in the libraries of lay readers and scholars alike, as we seek to understand the significance of the scriptural texts for our lives today, and for years to come.&lt;/p&gt;" />
