  <title>Because He Loves Me - Elyse M. Fitzpatrick</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Simply speaking, love changes people. Christians, then, by definition, should exhibit the greatest transformation of all because, rightly understood and cherished, God&#39;s love makes them increasingly more like the One who has lavished his love on them.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This truth is meant to tell believers who they are, their purpose and destiny, and how to faithfully persevere in their struggles against all opposition. But sometimes people lose sight of this. &lt;cite&gt;Because He Loves Me&lt;/cite&gt; restores that vision, reminding Christians of their true identity as beloved children of God-adopted by the Father, espoused to the Son, and empowered by the Holy Spirit.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Christianity is not a self-improvement program but a transferring of identity and growth, accomplished in history through Christ and in our daily lives through his Spirit. This book explores and celebrates these truths in an unforgettable way. Study questions and invitations for deeper discovery conclude each chapter.&lt;/p&gt;" />
