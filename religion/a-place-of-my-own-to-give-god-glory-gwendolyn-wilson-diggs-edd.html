  <title>A Place of My Own to Give God Glory - Gwendolyn Wilson Diggs EdD</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Years ago, devout Christian Gwendolyn Wilson Diggs thought shed been forgotten by God. While waiting in line for a life purpose, she felt skipped over. Others members of her musically inclined family sang or played instruments, yet she did nothing. Then, during a particularly dark period, she sat down and screamed, God, what do you want me to do? His response: Spread my Word and proclaim the gospel of Christ.
Diggss &lt;i&gt;A Place of My Own to Give God Glory&lt;/i&gt; offers forty devotions, each illuminated by scripture and inspired by God. By putting God first and seeking His face, Diggs discovered her true purpose; since then, she has been filled with the joy and peace of Christ, and she seeks to spread His Word to the whole world. She artfully combines life experiences with scripture, turning each devotion into applicable lessons for your Christian walk, with included journal sections for personal reflection.
Proverbs tells us, In all thy ways acknowledge Him, and He shall direct thy paths. God is waiting for you to walk at His side. These daily devotions will encourage you to view your difficulties from a Christian perspective. All of your questioning will reveal your purpose. God does hear you, and He wants you to hear His voice. All it takes is daily devotion to Him, and never forget the most important thing in life: Give God Glory!" />
