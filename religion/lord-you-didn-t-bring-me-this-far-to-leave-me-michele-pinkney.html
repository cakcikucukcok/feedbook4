  <title>Lord, You Didn’T Bring Me This Far to Leave Me!!! - Michele Pinkney</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The purpose of this book is to experience and gain revelation concerning the faithfulness of God and the power of his Holy Spirit once we get into the word of God and set time aside
with prayer, fasting, with praise and worship. We must understand that God has a purpose and a plan for our lives, but in order to know what that is, we must get to know him and allow the worries of our lives to be turned over to God and allow the Holy Spirit to come in and comfort us,
and the blood of Jesus to cleanse us from our sins. .
&lt;p&gt;This book allows us to know that we are in a time where we are crying out to God concerning
our health, wealth and relationships these areas of our life is being attacked by the enemy, and
sometimes it may seem as if God is not responding to our cries. The Holy Spirit is a part of our
lives and he is there to intercede for us when we do not know what to say concerning our live issues.
Praying in our heavenly language daily and meditating on the word of God is a way that God can
and will answer us when we call upon him. When we are feeling left alone with sickness and disease
plaguing our body, and there seems to be no relief in sight for us. God is our relief and the answer
to the sickness and disease, health, wealth, and relationship issues that we face, through the blood
of Jesus. We must spend time in the word of God in order to build up our knowledge of Jesus and
his promises to those that believe in him. The word of God will give us revelation concerning what
is required in order for us to be healed, delivered, and to be set free from sins and all other issues
that are affecting our lives, family, and health.
&lt;p&gt;Jesus promised us that greater works we should do. In order for us to know our inheritance through
the blood of Jesus and obtain results we must know and have a relationship with the Holy Spirit
which means speaking in our heavenly language at all times.
&lt;p&gt;Jesus loves us and his promises are sure, tap into the realm of the supernatural through prayer in
the Holy Spirit." />
