  <title>Books Written in Stone: Volume 2 - J. Marc. Merrill</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Like the Great Pyramid, mysteries surround the other pyramids as well as other features found at the Giza plateau in Egypt. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Why does the second pyramid have two entrances, both off center, while the single entrance to the third pyramid is centered? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; What was the purpose of the two lower chambers in the second pyramid?  Moreover, why was the sarcophagus in this pyramid made to be wider than the passages that lead to the upper chamber?  In a related matter, why were the bones of a bull placed in the sarcophagus?  And why was the sarcophagus sunk into the floor up to its lid? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; At the third pyramid, why were parts of a body dating to the Christian period wrapped in a coarse yellow woolen cloth and buried beneath three feet of rubbish in the upper chamber? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Why in the third pyramid was the lower vaulted chamber designed so that it would absorb both sound and light? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Out on the plateau, what was the purpose of the so-called trial passages? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; On the south side of the Great Pyramid, why was an ancient boat dismantled and buried in a pit east of that pyramids north-south axis?  And what was stored in the other pit west of the axis? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Do the four so-called air shafts in the Great Pyramid link the three major pyramids together?  And how are the compartments above the Kings Chamber related to the end time? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;David Furlong, author of The Keys to the Temple, says the whole of the Giza complex was based on a coherent design intended to portray a spiritual theme (page 89).  Volume 2 of Books Written in Stone: Enoch the Seer, the Pyramids of Giza, and the Last Days provides the evidence to support this thesis. &lt;/p&gt;" />
