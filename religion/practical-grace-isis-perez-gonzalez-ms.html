  <title>Practical Grace - Isis Perez-Gonzalez Ms</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Grace is a word so commonly used yet so misunderstood. Every human being was saved by this unmerited favor called grace, but not all know it.  In this ground breaking book, Isis Perez-Gonzalez - who is not a pastor or religious educator, but rather a mental health professional - takes biblical references, counseling strategies and her testimony to create a book about activating grace from the point of view of a believer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;em&gt;Practical Grace: Through the Eyes of a Believer&lt;/em&gt;, Isis  teaches you how to connect with the real you which is spirit.  She explains, You are one with God. You need to activate the Spirit inside of you as you would a GPS. The GPS system in your car can take you where you want to go, but if you do not activate it, it will not work. You have to put the address in the system and trust that you are on the right path.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;With a no-nonsense approach she teaches you that you hold the key to your relationship with God.  She shows you that if you are hearing and reading the Word but you are not applying it into your daily life, you are rejecting the precious gift of grace that God has given you.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;In this book Isis PG explains how you can:&lt;/p&gt;
activate grace daily;
invite the Holy Spirit through breath;  
release victimization, control and resentments; and
be free of judgments
&lt;p&gt;She reveals practical strategies on how to become a masterful Christian.&lt;/p&gt;" />
