  <title>Sermons from the Fount - Dr Tommy Mthembu</title>
      <meta name="description" content="CHAPTER 1
In the very first chapter a discussion is opened and titled: open the eyes of my heart Lord. This sets up the main running theme of the book that Gods guidance, direction and path be every believers aim and focus. God is shown as the final arbiter in all of mans affairs. We are encouraged to seek the revealed truth in our lives. Our prayer and wish should be that God directs all our ways. The story of the prophet Elisha under attack is used to illustrate Gods providence for his children. Because Elishas spiritual eyes are open, he is not filled with fear and panic in light of his enemies but is reassured of Gods protective shield over his life. God surrounds his children with his love. God is a warrior and fights our battles.
CHAPTER 2
Nothing is too hard for the Lord. Sarah and Abraham had been married for a long time and had no children. They even tried to help God in this regard but their attempt was remiss. Our faith in God helps us to get results that are otherwise impossible. Sarah was rich, had a large household, servants, and animals and all but lacked one thing, a son she could call her own. This became a source of misery and ridicule for her. As rich as she was, when people looked at her they just remembered her shortcoming and constantly reminded her about it. Her faith gave birth to strength and power. Through the faithfulness of God and her practicing faith principles she bore a son when all hope was lost. Read her story to build your faith and see your trust in God soar.
CHAPTER 3
The book of James admonishes Christians to be glad when they face tough testing situations. This results in patience, a requisite believers virtue. Temptations and trials may leave us broken, dejected and discouraged. We may be broken but not valueless, because God sees value in us however our status; as he is in the business of transforming our lives. God is able to spring to life and quicken our spirit even after adverse experiences. The life of Paul the apostle is used to illustrate that we can endure all sorts of persecution to remain in focus, on the right path and remain resolute in our faith. Like a diamond we can withstand pressure in order to let our light shine through.
CHAPTER 4
God is powerful far beyond our imagination or comprehension; there is no limit to what He can do. Its only when we come to Him that we can reach our fullest potential. God also possess all wisdom. This is why it is not prudent to put ones trust in the help of man. Gods wisdom does not fail. The story of Noah teaches us that through Gods wisdom he, an unlearned and unqualified engineer; built, maintained, sailed and saved humanity and all animals all at once. Can you begin to marvel at the plumbing and ablution feat this must have been! Everything we are capable of counts for nothing if the source is not God. He has the power to change the times and the seasons of our lives. He can change your time of mourning into a time of joy. God is all-powerful; everything on earth is under His control. 
CHAPTER 5
Sometimes the troubles and tribulations that follow us cant seem to have an end. They leave us feeling forsaken. We may remove our eyes from God and focus on them. An account of how the children of Israel were faced with their enemy on countless occasions but finally prevailed is given. Gods leading through Moses and Aaron is expounded. Against Pharaoh they had an indomitable, ferocious, stubborn adversary. Time after time even after relenting, he would be oppressively behind the children of Israel. I show in this account that no matter how many our enemies, no matter how well armed, no matter our humble unprotected lowly position, God fights our battles for us. We know we can prevail through him. 
CHAPTER 6
The book of Ezra depicts a picture of a people who were heavily discouraged. It speaks of people who were told they would never finish what God had commissioned them to do. Zerubbabel is the leader at th" />
