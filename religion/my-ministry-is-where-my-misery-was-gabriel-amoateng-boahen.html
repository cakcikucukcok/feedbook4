  <title>My Ministry Is Where My Misery Was - Gabriel Amoateng-Boahen</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The aim of this book is to help every believer and minister of the Gospel to boldly speak about their painful past with the intent to positively impact lives through their respective testimonies and ministries that were born out of their past miseries. Thus, &amp;quot;My Ministry Is Where My Misery Was.&amp;quot; Some of us are conscious of the genesis of our calling and the correlation between our painful past and present ministry, some may not. However, through these difficulties of life came our present ministries. There are many of such ministries out there, probably including yours. The ministry of Tim Ryan to whom I dedicated this book to, is one of such ministries that has touched my life in many ways. Tim shares his personal testimony of liberation from addiction with many today. us, his present ministry was his past misery. The book further discussed how we respond to God&amp;#39;s call, the challenges associated with the call and how to overcome them and thrive in ministry. &amp;quot;But as for you, you meant evil against me; but God meant it for good, in order to bring it about as it is this day, to save many people alive&amp;quot; (Gen. 50:20, NKJV). Joseph&amp;#39;s past misery became his ministry that liberated an entire nation to the glory of God.&lt;/p&gt;" />
