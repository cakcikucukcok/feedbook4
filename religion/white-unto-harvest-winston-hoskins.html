  <title>White Unto Harvest - Winston Hoskins</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;A book written to instruct and inform Christians about the Power that we have resident in us. Jesus tells the disciples in Luke: 10; l9, Behold, I give unto you Power to tread on serpents and scorpions, and over all the power of the enemy: and nothing shall by any means hurt you.
&lt;p&gt;
This generation has failed to teach what the Bible tells us. Because we are worried about what the world has to say: (we want to be politically correct). And as a result this generation has very little knowledge of what the Word has to teach us.
&lt;p&gt;
This book gives the reader the Biblical Facts about those who should be rulers over us and what The Word has to say about rulers, isnt what the politicians want you to believe. When those in charge over us are ungodly men then the laws that they make are to help them keep their positions, their agenda, and their authority.
&lt;p&gt;
I believe that you will enjoy reading this book. And you will want all of your friends and associates to read it also. &lt;p&gt;" />
