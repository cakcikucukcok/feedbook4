  <title>Souls of the Asylum - Berta Lockhart, Doug Lockhart</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Its 3:00 a.m. on a chilly March morning. You are curled deep within your bed and even deeper within the realm of sleep. Suddenly you are shaken from this peaceful moment by a loud voice that says very plainly, WAKE UP!
 As you lie very still willing your heart to slow to normal, you become aware of voices around you. Who are they? Who are they speaking to? Each voice determined to be heard, each one wanting to give an account. All of their stories are very different except for one common thing: the endings all seem to be the same. You realize that you are in the middle of a conversation, somewhere between reality and sleep, somewhere between the physical and the non-physical. Is this a dream? Is part of this a dream and part of it real? If so, which is which? You begin to listen closer and to wake up. You have heard detailed information about the lives of individuals that lived over a hundred years ago, and all are speaking of their experiences in an Ohio lunatic asylum.
Then the conversation moves from past to present, and suddenly they are speaking to you! They begin to involve you in this conversation and ask for your help. Could you do what is asked of you? Could you make sense of this? 
Discover the people and their stories that have been independently verified as they unfold, and this story now becomes a quest. Find out how an Ohio blacksmith and his family accept this challenge and begin an unforgettable journey between the present and the past." />
