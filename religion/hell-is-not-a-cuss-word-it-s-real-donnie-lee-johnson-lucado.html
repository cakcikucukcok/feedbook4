  <title>Hell Is Not a Cuss Word: It’S Real! - Donnie Lee Johnson Lucado</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;We spend trillions of dollars seeking to explore space, discover new worlds, and learn about extraterrestrials, but the one world which is more relevant to our lives than any other is hell. Why? Because if its real, nobody wants to go there!  &lt;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What if you had died, gone to hell, and God in His love and mercy, allowed you to come back and tell about it? This was Donnie Lees experience.  &lt;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many have reported to have near-death experiences or have died and have gone to heaven. Whether it was the real place or a faade, we love to hear their story. But hell is one place which remains a mystery to most. What is hell like?  Is it as terrible, as many say, or is it a party place? Who goes there? How good does one have to be to avoid hell? What wonders are there to see? Pleasant or unpleasant, we are still curious.  We want details, details, details! Don has the answers to these and many more questions in this firsthand account.&lt;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you suspect that hell is not a nice place and youd like to avoid it if at all possible, this book may hold the answer for you!  
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Youll know for sure that hell is not a cuss word: its real!&lt;p&gt;" />
