  <title>You Are Cherished - Folasade Osuntuyi</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This book is a must for all. I gladly recommend it. It will bring health to your body and peace and joy to your soul. Your spirit will be nourished by reading this book. Jeremiah 31:3 says, The Lord has appeared of old to me saying, Yes I have loved you with an everlasting love, therefore with loving kindness I have drawn you. God is supreme, and his supremacy should and must be acknowledged by those he created. Jeremiah 29:11 says, For I know the thoughts that I think toward you, says the Lord, thoughts of peace and not of evil, to give you a future and a hope. What a gracious and loving God he is! He creates life and only he has the power to control life. He gives and he takes. While still alive, allow God in his supremacy and divinity or divine nature to take absolute control of your being and life. You didnt create yourself, he did, and he is able to sustain you in all aspects of your life. Jeremiah 30:17 says, For I will restore health to you and heal you of your wounds, says the Lord, because they called you an outcast saying this is Zion no one seeks her. Romans 5:8 says, But God demonstrates his own love toward us, in that while we were still sinners, Christ died for us. Gods plans toward you, his creation, are enormous and resounding. He proves it with the backing of all the promises given in the Holy Scriptures for us to read, claim, and proclaim it because they are words of life and brings prosperity. You Are Cherished is the book to have, to give, and to cherish for generations to come. God bless you as you read. Amen." />
