  <title>Are You Not the God in Heaven - A Word to Encourage</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&quot;A Word to Encourage
is a ministry tool for the Christian. It is a collection of greeting books and cards written to address
common concerns to uplift the reader. They can be used as a follow up tool to teach, encourage,
and caution. The writings are dramatized presentations or paraphrased teachings which render an
interpretation of the Word of God.
A book can be sent to the receiver periodically to water the seed of the Holy Spirit, or plant the seed
into the new believers heart. The writings can also be used with your prayers, to reel Christ into the
heart of an unbeliever who is struggling with lifes challenges. And finally the writings can be used
to console and reassure the brother or sister in Christ as God purifies their faith through illnesses,
death, or other hurtful events that occur in life.&quot;" />
