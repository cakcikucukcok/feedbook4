  <title>Counsel for Couples - Jonathan D.  Holmes, Alistair Begg</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;You aren&#39;t a licensed marriage and family therapist. You didn&#39;t do a doctoral dissertation on pastoral counseling. You&#39;re simply God&#39;s person caring for God&#39;s people in the local church. And the marriages in your church need help.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many pastors feel ill-equipped to handle the challenges that arise when a couple is going through marital difficulties. They feel lost and inadequate. What do you say? What counsel do you offer? Should I say anything or just listen? Do I schedule a follow-up appointment? Do I ask questions? What questions?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you are or have been in this situation before, this book offers you a practical guide to get started with the first sessions and then offers specific guidance on nine of the most common topics that come up in marriage counseling. Author and pastor Jonathan Holmes offers a solid, biblical theology and methodology to help you navigate through the world of marriage counseling with the fundamental conviction that God&#39;s word is powerful enough to address the deepest of marital issues, and robust enough to handle whatever might come your way. In each chapter, you&#39;ll meet a new couple dealing with a different issue, much like the people in your church, office, and neighborhood. Through the book you&#39;ll also hear advice from several respected voices in the biblical counseling community.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whether you&#39;re a novice or already knowledgeable, &lt;em&gt;Counsel for Couples&lt;/em&gt; provides theologically sound and biblically practical tools to help you as you help couples in need.&lt;/p&gt;" />
