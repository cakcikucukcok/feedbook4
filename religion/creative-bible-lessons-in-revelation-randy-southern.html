  <title>Creative Bible Lessons in Revelation - Randy Southern</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Was the book of Revelation penned by the crazy uncle in the family of Bible writers?You try to convince yourself that the apostle john is just another New Testament writer–kindly, gentle, loving. You know…normal.But he’s just so weird! Most of the time you have no idea what John is talking about in his revelation. When you must interact with his wild, otherworldly book, you escape as soon as you can to familiar, saner Bible texts. Like Matthew’s Gospel or one of Paul’s letters–after all, they straight-up tell you what Jesus did and what you should do!Yet Creative Bible Lessons in Revelation will quickly convince you and your students that St. John wasn’t so much a crazy guy as he was a visionary, inspirational, and worshipful guy! And you don’t have to subscribe to any pre- or post-eschatology theory in order to learn all sorts of good stuff from the apostle.So while these 12 sessions–complete and ready-to-teach–won’t help your students identify who the antichrist is or give them the coordinates of Armageddon’s opening salvos, they will, however, acquaint your youth group with the mysterious nature of Revelation, then demonstrate how these apocalyptic principles actually provide practical application for us today.Here’s what’s inside every session:-Detailed overviews for clear, convenient prepping.-Intriguing activities and games-with-a-point that introduce that session’s topic.-Hardcore Bible studies and provocative questions that trigger dialogue in both large and small groups.-Application exercises that translate John’s visions into practical, attainable actions and attitudes for students’ daily lives.Plus, you’ll get these bonuses:-Let’s Get Theological–lite intros to the various interpretations of the reactions to the events Revelation predicts-More More More–helpful supplements to activities and discussions-Worthy of Worship–top-drawer suggestions for turning ordinary youth meetings into extraordinary times of praising God.Questions about the future lurk in everyone’s minds–especially in the minds of teenagers. Now is your chance to explore the book of Revelation with your students–to glimpse at the never-ending worship to come, to grab hold of God’s promises and his mercy, and to bring some ease to troubled hearts." />
