  <title>Human Spirituality and Happiness - Lok Sang Ho</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;This is a collection consisting largely of poems and Lok- Sang&#39;s translation of the Daodejing, the Xin Xin Ming, and the Heart Sutra, plus a number of short passages grouped under the title of The Essence of Spirituality from A to Z. The book brings together the teachings from the west and from the east about how to live a rich, fulfilling life. Carrying the subtitle &quot;a tribute to Life&quot;, the author promotes his &quot;happiness formula&quot; LIFE, consisting of Love, Insight, Fortitude, and Engagement, pleading with readers that Life is the only resource we have and that we all need to do the best we can to ensure that its potential can be realized. That is the surest and the only way to gain happiness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Professor Liah Greenfeld, Boston University:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Today, when history takes one of its true great turns ....Lok Sang Ho&#39;s book appears particularly timely.... It is a book of poetry not only because it contains masterful original renditions of the Song of the Truthful Mind, the Heart Sutra, and most remarkably, the Daodejing of Laozi, but essentially because it seems to feel its way to enlightenment with words, using words as a search-light, rather than a recording medium of ideas and impressions.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Drew Weiss, Clinical Psychiatrist, Carleton College:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;As I read verse 57(of the Daodejing) again, I am reminded of my culture, the clever gadgets in most people&#39;s hands today afford access to the world&#39;s many great wisdoms and to information essential to becoming a fully engaged member of society. Yet much of what people week and share is rubbish or worse and most seem completely unaware of themselves, the world, or the effects of their clever gadgets. This book is a treasure.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;" />
