  <title>Warfare and Waves: Calvinists and Charismatics in the Church of England - Peter Herriot</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Why is the Church of England perceived by many as homophobic, misogynist, or just plain weird? Because two movements within it, the Calvinists and the Charismatics, have recently achieved a degree of influence disproportionate to their numerical strength. And how has this come about? Both movements are well organized and wealthy. The Calvinists have played the media and ecclesiastical politics games with skill and determination, while sternly identifying themselves as guardians of the one true Reformed doctrine, having no truck with &quot;the world.&quot; The Charismatics, on the other hand, have embraced many elements of late-modern culture but retain a premodern worldview. Peter Herriot argues that to recover from the opportunity costs and reputational damage that it has suffered at their hands, the Church of England must seize back the agenda from the Calvinists and face outwards rather than inwards. In its efforts to come to terms with globalization, the elephant in the Anglican crypt, the church&#39;s leadership will need to sideline the Calvinists and encourage the Charismatics with their recent increased social involvement. Written by a social psychologist, this book is full of detailed case studies that give a vivid insight into the organizational structures and subcultures of these two very different evangelical movements." />
