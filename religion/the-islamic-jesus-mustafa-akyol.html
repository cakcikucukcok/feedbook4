  <title>The Islamic Jesus - Mustafa Akyol</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&quot;A welcome expansion of the fragile territory known as common ground.&quot; --&lt;i&gt;The New York Times&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Reza Aslan&#39;s bestseller &lt;i&gt;Zealot&lt;/i&gt; came out in 2013, there was criticism that he hadn&#39;t addressed his Muslim faith while writing the origin story of Christianity. In fact, Ross Douthat of &lt;i&gt;The&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; wrote that &quot;if Aslan had actually written in defense of the Islamic view of Jesus, that would have been something provocative and new.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mustafa Akyol&#39;s &lt;i&gt;The Islamic Jesus&lt;/i&gt; is that book.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Islamic Jesus&lt;/i&gt; reveals startling new truths about Islam in the context of the first Muslims and the early origins of Christianity. Muslims and the first Christians--the Jewish followers of Jesus--saw Jesus as not divine but rather as a prophet and human Messiah and that salvation comes from faith &lt;i&gt;and&lt;/i&gt; good works, not merely as faith, as Christians would later emphasize. What Akyol seeks to reveal are how these core beliefs of Jewish Christianity, which got lost in history as a heresy, emerged in a new religion born in 7th Arabia: Islam.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Akyol exposes this extraordinary historical connection between Judaism, Jewish Christianity and Islam--a major mystery unexplored by academia. From Jesus&#39; Jewish followers to the Nazarenes and Ebionites to the Qu&#39;ran&#39;s stories of Mary and Jesus, &lt;i&gt;The Islamic Jesus&lt;/i&gt; will reveal links between religions that seem so contrary today. It will also call on Muslims to discover their own Jesus, at a time when they are troubled by their own Pharisees and Zealots.&lt;/p&gt;" />
