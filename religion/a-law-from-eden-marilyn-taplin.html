  <title>A Law from Eden - Marilyn Taplin</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Both John the Baptist and Jesus said, Behold, the kingdom of heaven is at hand. Yet we know that heaven will only come when sin ends. Therefore, humankind needs to know which sin removed us from the first paradise Eden. In &lt;em&gt;A Law from EdenSolving the Mystery of Original Sin&lt;/em&gt;, author Marilyn Taplin looks to the Bible to show that the true original sin is not pride or the seeking of knowledge about good and evil; rather, she shows that the true original sin is an act of sexual perversion. A misunderstanding of human sexuality has led to this morally wicked society, and biblical research shows how sexual acts originating in ancient pagan societies and now found in contemporary LGBT communities have distorted the way even those professing to be Christians view their own sexuality. Many believe that the world is moving in the wrong direction, and Jesus shows us how to reverse that direction and bring Eden to the earth once again. If those professing to be Christians learn the powerful truth about original sin and end this sexual act, then they will be able to help usher in the heaven on earth promised by God.&lt;/p&gt;" />
