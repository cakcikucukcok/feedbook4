  <title>Whiter Than Snow - Paul David Tripp</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;What do you do when you&#39;ve really blown it? Is sin really as dangerous and is grace really as powerful as the Bible says they are? Is there such a thing as a new beginning?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Sin and grace-these are the two themes of our lives. We all blow it and we all need to start over again. In Psalm 51, David tells his story of moral failure, personal awareness, grief, confession, repentance, commitment, and hope. And because David&#39;s story is every believer&#39;s story, Psalm 51 is every believer&#39;s psalm. It tells how we, as broken sinners, can be brutally honest with God and yet stand before him without fear.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Whiter Than Snow&lt;/cite&gt; unpacks this powerful little psalm in fifty-two meditations, reminding readers that by God&#39;s grace there is mercy for every wrong and grace for every new beginning. Designed for busy believers, these brief and engaging meditations are made practical by the reflection questions that conclude each chapter.&lt;/p&gt;" />
