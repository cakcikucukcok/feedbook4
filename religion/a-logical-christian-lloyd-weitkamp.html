  <title>A Logical Christian - Lloyd Weitkamp</title>
      <meta name="description" content="It all started about ten years ago when I wanted to renew my faith in God. Unsure of all the generated media, talking heads, and constant onslaught of commentary between various Christian and non-Christian groups, I decided to study the Bible and history on my terms. I wanted to know what the Bible actually taught and how Christianity has played out through history. I wanted to put at ease any doubts and concerns that I had regarding many of what I saw as alarming aspects and practices. It is my assumption that the teachings and guidelines of an Omnipotent Creator would have depth, logic, and refined wisdom. These teachings would transcend time and advance society through foresight and reasoning. The teachings of Jesus Christ would be as relevant today as they were then. His teachings would promote unity and understanding that is needed to develop a Christian society. These teachings and guidelines would be constructed to advance not only Christendom but the entire world through knowledge and understanding.
In these writing, I will try to show my understanding of Christianity. My perspective requires that logic and morals, and common sense must accommodate the teachings of Jesus Christ and Paul. I will try to do this by using not only scripture but by using our history and present social and economic conditions. In this I will try to show the correlation between how Jesus taught and his concept of Christianity and how to advance social and economic conditions. 
When you read the teachings of Jesus Christ in the New Testament, you will find the highest degree of moral values, ethics, and civility. 
Everything about the teachings in the New Testament is set up to propel Christians to work with love, compassion, understanding, empathy, and equality so that society can advance together. Being a Christian is a commitment of dedication to living a life defined by the love of Jesus Christ and his sacrifice to the well-being and salvation of every person who has ever lived. Christianity is a higher level of maturity and dedication of responsibility to living a life free of the destructive influences of this world. This is so that you can better use your time and resources to helping and guiding others that are in need.
That is what being a Christian is all about." />
