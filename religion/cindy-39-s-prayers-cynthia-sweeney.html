  <title>Cindy&#39;s Prayers - Cynthia Sweeney</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;When one hears the word, prayer, often times they turn and run the other way. Prayers can be stuffy and very formal. Sometimes even hard to understand. I was determined to keep my prayers anything BUT that!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Life can be very challenging, and many times we dont know which way to turn. My goal in writing this collection of prayers was to take some of these challenging times, and make them less trying. To be able to see a different point of view. A new way of understanding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I by no means have all the answers. But, by sharing some of my stories, I am hopeful that I can express my thoughts on life in general, and possibly be an inspiration to others. Please enjoy them. I enjoyed writing them. For myself, and now...for you.&lt;/p&gt;
&quot;Cindy&#39;s prayers have come home to me like a breath of fresh air. Her words have inspired me to strengthen my relationship with God.&quot;&lt;/br&gt;
