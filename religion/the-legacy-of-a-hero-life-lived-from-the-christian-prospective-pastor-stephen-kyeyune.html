  <title>The Legacy of a Hero; Life Lived from the Christian Prospective - Pastor Stephen Kyeyune</title>
      <meta name="description" content="True heroes are not born heroes but are made heroes. Ultimately, our struggles and accomplishments inspire others. Great people come and go but the legacy is left behind for people to emulate, talk about and remember. This book is about a man that impacted my life. We should learn to appreciate the fact that in the natural world, great beings and intelligent beings dont die but continue living with the legacy left behind. The greatest of all people is Jesus Christ. He came on earth with a vision and goal to die in order to redeem others. He did not win for His own sake but He made all of us winners. He is our real icon of faith, peace, love, hope, redemption, unity, compassion, transparency, reconciliation, forgiveness, empathy... name it. 
This book is not just a biography but it is written in a compelling way to encourage your faith. Like all my books, it is not necessarily profiled to appeal to your emotions. It is written for the seekers of meaning and creators of legacy. Those of you who have read my books, the serial anecdotes point to the character of a teacher. I am a teacher by calling and write with prior intention to teach. I am neither a celebrated poet nor professional entertainer. Great story tellers leave you exited and wanting but a teacher leaves you thinking. I believe that a preacher that invokes your reasoning is the prince of the pulpit." />
