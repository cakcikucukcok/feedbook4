  <title>Oh Yes! I Can - Thea A. Barnes</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The purpose of this book is to help bring the church back to the basic.  We need more teaching on repent, water baptize, being fill with the Holy Ghost, and what it take to live a holy  life.  Thank the Lord for teaching on prosperity for we need it, I need it, especially in time like these.  I just feel the church need more teaching on the basic.  I believe in order to really get bless financially you must put the Lord first in your life.  You need to seek first the kingdom of God and all of His righteousness and all the other things will be add to you.  
I believe the church need to concentrate on living a holy life and teach young saint how to repent,  and present their body as a living sacrifice, holy acceptable unto the Lord, which is our reasonable service.  The Bible say the good work God has begun within us He will perform it until the day of the Lord Jesus Christ.  I want the church to know what it take to Live holy." />
