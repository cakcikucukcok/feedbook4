  <title>Learning Evangelism from Jesus - Jerram Barrs</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Studying Jesus&#39; conversations with diverse people in his day, Jerram Barrs draws lessons and principles for attractively communicating the gospel to unbelievers in our day.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Living in a culture that is opposed to Christianity tempts God&#39;s people to conform, to retreat, to be silent. But Jesus showed the way to live faithfully before an unbelieving world.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;As the greatest evangelist, Jesus exemplified how to attract people to the gospel. He modeled how to initiate spiritual conversations full of grace and truth. Christian evangelism, then, both in theory and practice, must be shaped by his pattern.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Seeking to articulate the passions and principles present in Christ&#39;s life and words, longtime L&#39;Abri staff member Jerram Barrs has studied Jesus&#39; diverse encounters with people throughout the Gospels. Each chapter of &lt;em&gt;Learning Evangelism from Jesus&lt;/em&gt; recounts one of those stories, draws useful lessons for readers&#39; lives and communication of the gospel, and concludes with questions for further reflection and application. This highly practical book will guide Christians in how to live before unbelievers and how to love them into the kingdom, just as Jesus did.&lt;/p&gt;" />
