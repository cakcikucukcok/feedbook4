  <title>A Journey to the High Places: Hannah Hurnard&#39;s Spirituality and the Song of Songs - Christopher Felix Bezzina, Charlò  Camilleri</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Since his existence the human being has explored various ways in his quest for God. Part of this search is related to humanity&#39;s yearning for true harmony and joy in the world. Christian spirituality, as a unique spirituality one encounters today, imparts various ways one can respond to this longing. One of these ways is through allegorical narratives. Specifically, this study analyzes the spirituality of Hannah Hurnard (1905-1990) by intertextually perusing her most famous allegorical narrative Hinds&#39; Feet on High Places.    A Journey to the High Places is divided into four chapters. In chapter 1 the allegorical narrative is subjectively considered in all its aspects and the central themes are expressed without any reference to other secondary connections. Chapter 2 analyzes the allegorical narrative by relating this narrative with other material that Hannah Hurnard published. These other narratives provide the tools which Hannah employed in the composition of this allegorical narrative. Thus, chapter 2 presents an intertexual analysis between her other publications and Hinds&#39; Feet on High Places. Likewise, chapter 3 presents another intertextual analysis between the many biblical abstracts and their relation to the narrative, in the hope of showing her biblical interpretations. Several spiritual themes that emerged from the preceding chapters are discussed in chapter 4, presenting a consistent spirituality. In presenting the themes one notes that the strong points and weaknesses of Hannah&#39;s spirituality are related to other Christian spiritual traditions. In order to conduct a comprehensive study the introductory section of this study deals with the significance of allegory and spirituality." />
