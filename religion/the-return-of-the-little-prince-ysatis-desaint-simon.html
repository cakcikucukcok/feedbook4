mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;&#39;&gt;My book, &lt;i&gt;The Return of &lt;span
class=GramE&gt;The&lt;/span&gt; Little Prince&lt;/i&gt;, is a sequel to the marvelous and
whimsical story of my uncle Antoine De Saint-&lt;span class=SpellE&gt;Exupery&lt;/span&gt;,
&lt;i&gt;The Little Prince&lt;/i&gt;, where myth and poetry mix with reality and speak to
us of the eternal in such an innocent manner.&lt;span style=&#39;mso-spacerun:yes&#39;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;Both his story and mine are true.&lt;span style=&#39;mso-spacerun:yes&#39;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;They are real stories of a quest to find that invisible spark of life
which gives meaning to all there is.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=MsoNormal style=&#39;text-align:justify&#39;&gt;&lt;span style=&#39;font-family:Arial;
mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;&#39;&gt;I learned the story from within, it was my
aunt Consuelo De Saint-&lt;span class=SpellE&gt;Exupery&lt;/span&gt;, an extraordinary
person and the inspiration of Saint-Ex, the Rose of his story, who taught me to
read, not only French in &lt;i&gt;The Little Prince&lt;/i&gt;, but the essence of it as
well.&lt;span style=&#39;mso-spacerun:yes&#39;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;She talked to me about Saint-Ex,
his dream world, of his airplane flights, of his moonstruck reveries, his
airplane falls and the spirit that helped him survive them!&lt;span
style=&#39;mso-spacerun:yes&#39;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;Everything in that book was an integral part
of what later happened to me and helped me to find that secret that now
illumines my life. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=MsoNormal style=&#39;text-align:justify&#39;&gt;&lt;span style=&#39;font-family:Arial;
mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;&#39;&gt;I &lt;span class=GramE&gt;remember.&lt;/span&gt; . .
when I was a little girl, maybe six years old, I learned to read. . . know. . .
and love the Little Prince.&lt;span style=&#39;mso-spacerun:yes&#39;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;Later on, I
learned that many others also did; it was, I believe, the bedside book of James
Dean.&lt;span style=&#39;mso-spacerun:yes&#39;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;I never knew him personally, but I
read in an interview of a movie magazine that he said &lt;i&gt;The Little Prince&lt;/i&gt;
was his &lt;span class=GramE&gt;Bible.&lt;/span&gt; . . and I wondered if what drew him to
it was the same thing that I loved about it?&lt;span style=&#39;mso-spacerun:yes&#39;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;What I loved best was the invisible hidden in between such simple words
and its childlike drawings, for concealed behind the fairytale there was a road
map to a true spiritual experience. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=MsoNormal style=&#39;text-align:justify&#39;&gt;&lt;span style=&#39;font-family:Arial;
mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;&#39;&gt;Whenever I read the last page of my
uncle&#39;s book, I was moved by his sadness and felt a sense of urgency within me
to find that lonely star landscape.&lt;span style=&#39;mso-spacerun:yes&#39;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;So,
I promised myself that one day I would find the Little Prince and let Saint-Ex
know that he was back.&lt;span style=&#39;mso-spacerun:yes&#39;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;Consequently,
since early in life, I learned to close my eyes, open my heart and&lt;span
class=GramE&gt;. .&lt;/span&gt; . &lt;span class=GramE&gt;began&lt;/span&gt; my quest.&lt;span
style=&#39;mso-spacerun:yes&#39;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;This tale is the fruit of my search.&lt;span
style=&#39;mso-spacerun:yes&#39;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;It has a happy ending as all good fairy tales
have, for it happened that one day. . . when I least expected it. . . I found
the Little Prince!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=MsoNormal style=&#39;text-align:justify&#39;&gt;&lt;span style=&#39;font-family:Arial;
mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;&#39;&gt;Thus, I wrote this book, both as a direct
answer to my uncle&#39;s plea, to share the good news with all those who love &lt;i&gt;The
Little Prince&lt;/i&gt; and as an invitation to quest to all those who long to find
their reality.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=MsoNormal style=&#39;text-align:justify&#39;&gt;&lt;span style=&#39;font-family:Arial;
mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;&#39;&gt;I have followed the same format of my
uncle&#39;s book and also utilized the same style of drawings, wrapping my own
story of how I searched and found the Little Prince with as much similarity as
possible to that of his book, for a very good reason: &lt;span
style=&#39;mso-spacerun:yes&#39;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;I couldn&#39;t have done it in any other way, for
I have loved &lt;i&gt;The Little Prince&lt;/i&gt; since I was a child.&lt;span
style=&#39;mso-spacerun:yes&#39;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;My reason has been one of love, not
arrogance, so please exempt me from the harshness of comparison if you are
inclined to do so.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
