  <title>Unchained Mind - Ricardo G. Williams</title>
      <meta name="description" content="I took a three-year break from work to explore the topic of peace, love, and success. I spent the time analyzing my thoughts and the effects my thoughts had on my emotional state of mind. The things I found out were quite intriguing. I came to the realization that many of us are not living to our full potential. We live with a measured joy. We keep our happiness in check. Our smiles are met with a restriction from our breath, which makes it short-lived. We seldom breathe fully because our breath is interrupted by the depth of our thoughts. We never really let go fully. We are bound by layers of chains that have entangled our thinkingchains from an uncertain future, chains of work, chains of relationships, chains of our finances, too many chains to mention. My time away from work gave me the opportunity to explore how to break the chains. I admit that even a broken chain is not permanently broken but can be easily reunited if old habits are not changed. My book focuses on the actions we can take to break chains and keep them broken. My book explores how our thoughts control our destiny. It teaches thought control and the importance of silence. It teaches how to overcome fear, anger, negative thoughts, stress, and hatred. You will learn how to nurture your emotions, embrace moments, and the importance of spiritual peace. I will teach you how to live in thankfulness, with compassion, while activating love." />
