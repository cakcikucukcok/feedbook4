  <title>Love &amp; Gospel Music - Timothy Blaine</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Warn me? I dont understand. You&#39;ve got to warn people before they come to your church?
     Well, actually its something that I make a point of telling all my gay friends before I invite them there, he said. Once, I made the mistake of inviting several of my friends from The Circus to the church to hear me sing in a special Easter service. The preacher took one look at my friends in all of their Easter glitter and sparkle and changed the sermon from &#39;The Resurrection of The Christ&#39; to &#39;The Sins of Sodom and Gomorrah.&#39;&quot;
&#39;Love &amp; Gospel Music&#39; is a love story both spiritual and natural. The story centers around young Dwayne Brown as he comes of age, and then falls in love with a man destined for greatness. With supernatural favor and guidance, the two men build a musical empire. 
But not everyone is thrilled with their success." />
