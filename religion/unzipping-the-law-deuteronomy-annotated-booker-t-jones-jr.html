  <title>Unzipping the Law Deuteronomy Annotated - Booker T Jones Jr</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Hello, my name is Booker T Jones, Jr. I’m the Author of the “Unzipping the Law” Series.
The Annotated series consists of four bible books; Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, and Deuteronomy. They are produced by the Unzipco Publishing Company.
The Unzipping the Law series cover the Saga of the sons of Israel’s last days of Egyptian bondage to their event filled arrival at the borders of the “Promised Land”.
This set of Laws were not given to the sons of Lot, Ishmael, Esau, or King David. They were given to the sons of Jacob called Israel ONLY!
Deuteronomy begins in the fortieth year on the first day of the eleventh month after Israel’s departure from Egypt.
The Wilderness years have come to a close and Moses speaks to the sons of Israel, according to all that the Lord had commanded him to give to them.
He undertook to expound where they, the sons of Israel have been and what lies before them. The blessings if they kept His commandments and the curses of disobedience." />
