  <title>Born to Sweet Delight - John Barry Forsyth</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;A sweet young boy looks down upon a frog. It is a moment of delight for himin life, nature, and everything that speaks to him of goodness and truth. He cares not that his shoes are old and worn out. He is released from whatever it is of poverty or contradiction that he must face. His destiny has been defined for him; his life is affirmed. Fate will not overcome him.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Certain patriarchs and matriarchs, poets and sages, lovers and apostles, slaves and hymn writers, and prisoners and pilgrims make their contribution to this volume. Their lives were taken up with journeys of faith and passages of profound significance for them and many others. They struggled bravely against oppression and refused to surrender. They were ordinary men and women of complex emotion and conflicting thought. Yet their movement was always forward to a welcoming God, the one who had always been with them in some way or another. In whatever circumstance they found themselves, they had an enduring smile in their hearts if not on their faces. They affirmed life and defied fate.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Within these pages, you will find encouragement for your faith, biblical exposition from the Old Testament scriptures with reference points to the New Testament, stories of journey and song, sagas of struggle and resolution, chronicles of courage and caring, and histories of divine interventionall of them measured against an infinite glory and the weigh scales of delight.&lt;/p&gt;" />
