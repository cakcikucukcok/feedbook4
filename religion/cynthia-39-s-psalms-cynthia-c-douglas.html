  <title>Cynthia&#39;s Psalms - Cynthia C. Douglas</title>
      <meta name="description" content="CYNTHIA&#39;S PSALMS  is a journal of love notes and poems inspired during a season of fasting and prayer in preparation for Cynthia&#39;s consecration into the fivefold ministry. 
 Each day (for 40 days) after spending quiet time ( at least an hour) in His Presence, she wrote a love note to God emphasizing:
 Love
 Passion 
 Intimacy 
 His Lovingkindness
 His Majesty
 His Sovereignty
 His  Royalty
 His Kingship   
 His Kingdom
There were times when His passionate Loving Presence  overshadowed her so strongly that she could not seem to write fast enough ,getting the words from her heart, through the pen, onto the paper.
  Cynthia&#39;s ultimate desire is to be just as David was,
&quot; A woman after God&#39;s own heart.&quot; Loving Him with all of her heart, mind and soul, brimming over with passion, hungering and thirsting for more and more intimacy with The King!" />
