  <title>The Biblical Gospel - Reid Hensarling</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;This book explores the only sure solution to the ongoing problems of our world-the biblical gospel of Jesus Christ. A variety of viewpoints are presented from our religious, political, and economic spectrums, but only the absolute truth of the gospel of Christ has the message that ultimately answers the most pressing questions and serious concerns of the human soul. The book is concerned with encouraging and helping church leaders bring spiritual renewal to their people through the biblical gospel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chapter one explains what the gospel is and the importance of the Bible and shows how a limited number of biblical figures were used by the Lord to bring spiritual renewal to their people. Chapter two describes the profound transformation that the proclamation of the gospel had upon sixteenth-century England. The pernicious dangers of our current postmodern culture are examined in chapter three, along with the only effective solution-the proclamation and reception of the biblical gospel. Chapter four proposes a model for growth and transformation in Christ through the renewal of the clergy and laity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The book concludes that mankind&#39;s only hope for eternal security and truth is found in the gospel of Jesus Christ, as presented through the pages of the Bible. The book illustrates that regardless of time, place, or nationality, the gospel declaration alone has the power to change human beings from lives of sin and rebellion against God and one another to lives filled with love and devotion to Jesus Christ and others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This book is designed to draw significant attention and interest to the churches&#39; obligation and critical calling by God to present the Holy Scriptures in a loving and truthful way to congregations that will bring lasting change to the body of Christ. Only the gospel has the ability to renew and transform people from a life of sin and rebellion against God to a life of love, devotion, and service to Christ. Lives start to change and people begin to think, live, and act more like Christ. The promises and truths of the gospel bring to the believer eternal security, lasting peace, and unspeakable joy. What an extraordinary additive to everyday living!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The faithful pastor is entrusted with God&#39;s Word to preach and teach absolute truth, which upon reception by the people brings repentance, forgiveness, salvation, and freedom. Ministers who are obedient to the gospel bring tremendous blessing and hope to their flocks. God&#39;s people are transformed and renewed and the kingdom of God is extended into a world desperately needing love and truth.&lt;/p&gt;" />
