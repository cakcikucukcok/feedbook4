  <title>Revelation: Removing the Prophetic Veil Bible Lesson 9 - K L Rich</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Revelation is one of the most controversial books of the Bible. Some people love its prophetic writings, while others reject its end time connotation. John, an apostle of Christ, was given this prophetic word to give to the seven churches of Asia Minor. A blessing was pronounced over all who reads and understand it. In this 9th Lesson, you will get a view into John&#39;s vision as he tells about the pouring of the seven bowls of God&#39;s wrath, which will fall upon the world prior to Jesus&#39; return and Babylon the Great, who will meet her ultimate demise. May God bless you as you read and understand this next lesson. May He open your heart to what He has to say to the Body of Christ." />
