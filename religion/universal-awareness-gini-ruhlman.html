  <title>Universal Awareness - Gini Ruhlman</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;In her latest work, Universal Awareness: Insights for Igniting the Power Within Us, author Gini Ruhlman reveals how our mindsets and belief systems are molded from the things we see, hear, or have been taught.  She encourages us to distinguish our truths from fact and how imperative it is for us to seek direction for our personal lives rather than allow others to do it for us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ruhlman addresses fear and control and the damaging consequences they have on us.  We are empowered with the ability to create positive or negative results in life.  With Wisdom and unconditional love, we can learn to use that power to grow, inspire, avoid conflicts and create peace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finding our truth and living it defines our greatest challenge, marking our critical, invigorating turning point to embrace a truly meaningful life.  Gini Ruhlman takes on this substantial task recounting insights drawn from her direct spiritual encounters and heartfelt and deeply moving journey.  Explaining to her readers in clear terms how to discover this breakthrough for themselves.  Gini  motivates her readers to embrace the positive, transformative, and joyful possibilities for a meaningful life as they discover their true path.  I highly recommend this important, refreshing, and gratifying read.&lt;/p&gt;
