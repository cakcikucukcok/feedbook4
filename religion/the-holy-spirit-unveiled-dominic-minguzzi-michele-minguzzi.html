  <title>The Holy Spirit Unveiled - Dominic Minguzzi, Michele Minguzzi</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The Brides Veil has been lifted&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mankind has been made to find and unlock the power of Gods Holy Spirit.  The body is a living time machine, and the Holy Spirit is the key to it.  We are going to find that key together and then be transported into the future of God time.  The Holy Spirit will then unveil the many secrets that mankind has hidden from himself.  The woman who has been ordered to keep silent in the church will finally speak!  It will be the Mona Lisa speaking to us through the Holy Spirit of Leonardo da Vinci.  The world has been trying to unlock her secrets for centuries but has only come up with false teachings.  It is the Holy Spirit of Jesus Christ that will be revealing her secrets to the world.  See for yourself how this book was written in the future, with the spirit of the living God, to be brought back into the past!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The secrets of a woman/ what the woman has been trying to say&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mona Lisas true reflection/Gods best-kept secret&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mirror of deception/ the reflection that Satan doesnt want you to see&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instruction manual to this amazing body/batteries not included&lt;/p&gt;
