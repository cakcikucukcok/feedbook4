  <title>Pearl on Mount Zion - Gabriel Pidomson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Understand the Ten Commandments, their summation, and the new commandment of Jesus in plain language! 
God continues to teach in new ways and often gives several twists to the same words and teachings in order to enable His children understand Him. The Ten Commandments were not intended to punish; they were given to enable the children of God to live a more fruitful life. However, our lack of understanding wrapped the ten precepts of life in complexities that made it difficult for us to thread the path of life. In response, God sent his only begotten son, Jesus, to unwrap their meaning and untangle us from the shackles of the law. 
Pearl on Mount Zion (PoMZ) unpacks the Ten Commandments, the summation, and the new commandment given by Jesus Christ. It traces the origin of sin and unpacks each commandment in plain language. The style adopted by Gabriel Pidomson enables the reader to deal with and appreciate why these laws are captured under the law of love (divided into the love of God and the love for ones neighbour) and how they transform into the new commandment given by Jesus in John 13:34.
The book is packed with covenant truths, supported with 809 references from various versions of the bible, depositories, sermons, pastoral letters and other scholarly sources that are not only informative and spiritually nourishing, but also interesting. It should be read with the understanding that human knowledge of Gods ways and commandments can only scratch the outskirts of the ways of God (Job 26:14), and we cannot understand the thunder of His power. In this context, the book is an inspired effort at the outskirts of Gods love, wisdom, meaning, and personality. As our dear friend, brother, creator, and saviour rightly said, I still have many things to say to you, but you cannot bear them now. When the Spirit of Truth comes, he will guide you into all the truth (John 16:12)." />
