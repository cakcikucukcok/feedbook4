  <title>Healing Thoughts - Marjorie Daun Timberlake-Linton</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Misfortune has no color, shape or form. Life happens and tragedies abound; relationships fail; people lose their fortunes; and people get sick and die. No matter who you are, as long as you are physically alive you will experience challenges, but the presence of God is within us as a mighty healing force and perfection in all things. The I within cannot be sick, limited, or afraid. The I within us cannot die. It is eternal. It is the living Spirit of God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Healing Thoughts, author Marjorie Daun Timberlake-Linton shares that when there is a conscious realization of the presence and power of God within, we can handle any situation that confronts us. It is the answer to every need, every desire, and all heartache. In moments of sickness and disease, doubts and anxiety, God is the answer. There is therefore nothing to heal or demonstrate, only the presence of God to be revealed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Timberlake Linton, an ordained minister, presents advice and suggests ways of embracing Gods healing including faith, rest, prayer, surrender and thanksgiving. Using a variety of personal anecdotes she covers such subjects as dealing with health challenges, stress and fear. At the end of each chapter, she offers a call to action and lists steps you can take to facilitate healing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Filled with encouragement and inspiration Healing Thoughts urges you to maintain a meaningful relationship with God, step out in faith, trust Gods promises that all things are possible, do what you can humanly do, and leave the rest to God.&lt;/p&gt;" />
