  <title>The Storm - Frederick Buechner</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The &lt;em&gt;Boston Globe&lt;/em&gt; calls Frederick Buechner &quot;one of our finest writers.&quot; &lt;em&gt;USA Today&lt;/em&gt; says he&#39;s &quot;one of our most original storytellers.&quot; Now this acclaimed author gives us his most beguiling novel yet--a magical tale of love, betrayal, and redemption inspired by Shakespeare&#39;s &lt;em&gt;The Tempest&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On wealthy Plantation Island in South Florida, an old man waits, Kenzie Maxwell is a writer, a raconteur, a rascal, an altruist, a mystic--a charismatic figure who enjoys life with his rich third wife but muses daily on the sins of his past. Two decades ago, Kenzie had to leave New York because of a scandal. He&#39;d been a volunteer at a runawat shelter, and he&#39;d fallen in love with a seventeen-year-old girl--a girl who died while giving birth to Kenzie&#39;s daughter. His older brother, Dalton, a lawyer and board member at the shelter, decided to quell the rumors by releasing Kenzie&#39;s note of apology to the press. Kenzie&#39;s reputation--and the girl&#39;s--were destroyed. He has never forgiven his brother.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now it&#39;s the eve of Kenzie&#39;s seventieth birthday, and a storm is brewing. His beloved daughter, Bree--the child of the scandal--is coming down from New York for his birthday party. But his brother Dalton is coming down, too, to do some legal work for the island&#39;s ill-tempered matriarch. Aided and abetted by Dalton&#39;s happy-go-lucky stepson, a loutish gardener, a New Age windsurfer, a bumbling bishop, and a bona fide tempest, Kenzie must somehow contrive to reconcile with his brother--and make peace with his past.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Infused with humanity, and informed by faith. &lt;em&gt;The Storm&lt;/em&gt; is Frederick Buechner&#39;s most captivating novel since &lt;em&gt;Godric&lt;/em&gt;--a richly satisfying contemporary story of fragmented families and love&#39;s many mysteries that will move you, makeyou laugh, and fill you with wonder.&lt;/p&gt;" />
