  <title>Why the Black Church Has Failed - Nathaniel Wilson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Unique as it is, the black church of America appears to be confused. If the church really has elevated the culture, experience, and tradition of its people above the truth of the Word of God, then now is the time to observe, study, and ultimately transform the black church into all it can be. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Nathaniel Wilson draws on his personal experiences as the son of a pastor and active member of the black church for his entire life to present a challenge to others to revisit basic biblical ideas, teachings, and philosophies and confront the truth of biblical spirituality. While examining how the black church has unwittingly taken popular clichs and elevated them above the scripture, Wilson encourages churchgoers to allow the spirit of God to take the scripture and let him teach uswhich has been Gods design from the beginning. With honesty, faith, and positivity, Wilson also shares observations on how to improve the current state of black churches. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Why the Black Church Has Failed shares a practical assessment that challenges churchgoers to think about the scriptures and how their own church relates to certain biblical truths.&lt;/p&gt;" />
