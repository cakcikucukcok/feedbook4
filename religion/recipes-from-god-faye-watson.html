  <title>Recipes from God - Faye Watson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;
    Ever sit on the arm of the throne? Ever had a french fry picnic with the Father? Are you ready to be lifted up?
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
    &lt;br/&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
    This thought-provoking book will lead you on a spiritual journey, a journey of joy and devotion. You will encounter recipes to feed the body and recipes to
    feed the soul. You will encounter Jesus and prayerfully work out your relationship with Him through object lessons presented in a quaint, easy-reading,
    loving manner.
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
    &lt;br/&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
    You will learn as you experience the joy of a grandmother spending time with her grandchildren. Come along now, time for you to sit on the arm of the
    throne, time to go on a french fry picnic, time to be lifted up, time to get ready for what lies ahead.
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
    Imagine a woman who loves her husband, loves her children, loves her grandchildren, and, more importantly, loves the Lord with all her heart and soul.
    These are the ingredients that make up Faye Watson. Reading her book, Recipes from God, will force you to rethink your priorities and remind us that its
    the simple things we do in life that matter most to God!
&lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;br/&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
    Faye has managed to write a sweet, tender book full of a grandmothers love of her grandchildren, yet also a book filled with love for others. This is a
    book that reaches out to draw the Christian to a closer walk with his Savior but also reaches out to the one who is unsaved to lead his heart to Christ.
&lt;/div&gt;
