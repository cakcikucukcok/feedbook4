  <title>Relish the Splendor of His Glory - Princess Adenike Akorede</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Revelation is a product of divine visitation and inspiration which eventually transforms and humbles us in His presence. Do you yearn for a change in your life? Are you tired      of life of shame, rejection, depression, dejection, lack, want and going round in circle?                You need a touch of God: you need Gods divine visitation. Realizing that you can not be divinely inspired out of your education or your degrees; it can only be by His grace.
Therefore, from divine inspiration comes the revelation of His Word which results into transformation. I believe that we can not receive anything unless it is given to us by the Almighty God: the Creator of the universe. This book is however written to avail people of the importance of accessing divine revelation of the Word of God to: DISCOVER GODS GLORIOUS PLAN FOR THEIR LIFE: LIVE IT, WALK IT AND ACTUALIZE IT.  It is a divinely inspired book with divine instructions to walk in the light of God to fulfill our destiny.
God has a plan and purpose for all His children, His plan is in their destiny and their destiny lies in their future. However, as Gods chosen vessels, we need to be under His influence: be filled with His wine, come under the intoxicating effect of the Word of God: and live under its influence. The wine of the Word brings you under the supernatural influence of the Word in your daily life. You become conscious of your status in life with a paradigm shift from your old to your new self. You become unstoppable, filled with the power to decide the happenings in your life. You are in command just like Jesus Christ: the Commander in Chief of the universe Himself. 
	Read Under the Influence to be divinely guided and  inspired
	Read the Bible to be wise
	Believe it to be safe
	Practice it to be holy
	Let it fill your memory, rule your heart and guide your feet. 
As you read this book, be ready to go far, beyond and above for you are now sitted with Christ in heavenly places. Amen." />
