  <title>One Accord - Cristina Manalo Vaughn, Felipe Cofreros, Ronald Jay Blassingame, Terrence Vaughn</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;RAVES ABOUT THE BOOK ONE ACCORD AN INSPIRATIONAL BOOK OF BIBLE PROMISES BY PROFESSIONAL EDUCATORS&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ONE ACCORD is practical but steeped on spiritual strength that should keep us going penned by Ronald Jay Blassingame Ph.D., Terrence Vaughn, Cristina Manalo Vaughn and Felipe Cofreros holds us in accord to loop up when the going gets rough and tough. Amidst the cares and vicissitudes of earthly life, we need a book that reminds us to transcend what is here and now. We need a book that speaks of inspiration to meaningful living. In looking up in hope and looking deep within us in faith, we are reminded that our sojourn from here to eternity is one of a unique travel spiced by travails that test the veracity of our humanity. We are not alone though. We are accompanied by Him who holds us by the hand. With the eyes of faith we can see through the dark; we can feel the joy of just being alive. A great book indeed that speaks from the fiber of our being both human and spiritual and the authors must be inspired by Him who calls us by our name.
