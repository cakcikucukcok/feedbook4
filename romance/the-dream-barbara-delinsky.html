  <title>The Dream - Barbara Delinsky</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The first novel in beloved bestselling author Barbara Delinsky&#39;s classic Crosslyn Rise trilogy &lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;about a family estate that&#39;s fallen into disrepair--and those who dream of bringing it back to life. Originally published in 1990,&lt;i&gt; The Dream&lt;/i&gt; is now available as an e-book for the first time.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;A house is not a home without love...&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For five generations, Crosslyn Rise has been the very heart of one of Massachusetts&#39;s finest families. But time and neglect have taken their toll...and now it&#39;s up to Jessica Crosslyn to do what it takes to restore its legacy. She will spare no effort nor expense to rebuild her ancestral home. But asking her to join forces with architect Carter Malloy is the one thing she cannot do. Jessica has known him since childhood--he was always a bully, and he was especially unkind to her--and she can&#39;t imagine working with him now. Unless Carter has truly changed...and Jessica can finally forgive him? Home: It&#39;s where the heart is. Can love be found there too?&lt;/p&gt;" />
