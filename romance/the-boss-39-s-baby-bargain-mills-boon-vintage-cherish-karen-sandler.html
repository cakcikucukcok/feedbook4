  <title>The Boss&#39;s Baby Bargain (Mills &amp; Boon Vintage Cherish) - Karen Sandler</title>

        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;AN IRRESISTIBLE PROPOSAL&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Allie Dickenson couldn&#39;t believe she was marrying her brooding boss, Lucas Taylor, the man she&#39;d been fantasizing about for the past year. But when he proposed a temporary union in exchange for helping her with her ailing father, she couldn&#39;t say no….&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;A FAMILY TO CALL HIS OWN&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Lucas desperately wanted a child, and marrying his loyal secretary would get his foot in the adoption agency&#39;s door. Although the jaded millionaire swore no woman could melt his steely defenses, he found himself powerfully drawn to his beautiful bride–and their sizzling night of passion resulted in a baby on the way! Could Lucas finally overcome his tormented past…or did he risk losing the love he&#39;d always longed for?&lt;/p&gt;
