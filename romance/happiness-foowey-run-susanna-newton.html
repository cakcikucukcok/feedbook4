  <title>Happiness Foowey....Run! - Susanna Newton</title>
      <meta name="description" content="What may seem to be a romance is not at all what this novel is actually about. This fictional book contains a little of everything, not so much for just the females any longer, Romance, mystery, comedy, deceit, adventure as this small framed woman becomes the night mare for this all American famous Bounty/PI who was first assigned to her case with twists and turns enough to make you sit on the edge of the seat wanting, needing to know whats next in this triangle of love/hate. Oh yes there are plenty of women who are known as Man eaters but this small town girl comes packing ready for each and every battle this handsome egotistical man brings, is she the victim or does she have something else in mind through out the series of this roller coaster ride of adventure that never seems to end. Susies journey down the road of heaven and hell continues finding Roberts brother Paul has a twin brother adding further turmoil and harm to this already hell filled life others thought to be a life of leisure. A few times Susie almost calls it quits but something was guiding her to find the truth that is not yet revealed, actually causing her to feel it was more of a duty to find the truth rather than just wanting this relationship to work. A true friend comes into the picture in this second novel of the Murray series helping provide strength but also provides the means to turn the mind games around during this journey of unjust circumstances. Can this friend be called an angel or is he just in it for the hell of it?" />
