  <title>One Night in Vegas (Entangled Lovestruck) - C. M. Stone</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Eliza DeMatteo returns to her hometown of Las Vegas on vacation knowing her matchmaking older brother is probably going to try and set her up with his best friend. But Eliza already knows plenty about sexy cowboy Christian Yerrick, the man who crushed her heart when they were kids. In fact, she&#39;s determined to avoid Chris completely...until she runs into his truck on the Las Vegas freeway. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chris has his own misgivings about seeing Eliza. His lingering feelings for her trigger all of his issues with relationships. Especially long-distance ones, which is the only kind of relationship they&#39;d ever have. Still, there&#39;s no reason they can&#39;t enjoy New Year&#39;s Eve together. But when the fireworks between them burn hotter than the Vegas Strip, Chris and Eliza know they only have one night to get it right. Because this time, what doesn&#39;t happen in Vegas could haunt them forever...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each book in the Gambling Hearts series is a standalone, full-length story that can be enjoyed out of order.&lt;br&gt;Series Order:&lt;br&gt;Book #1 One Night in Vegas&lt;br&gt;Book #2 How to Save a Surgeon&lt;/p&gt;" />
