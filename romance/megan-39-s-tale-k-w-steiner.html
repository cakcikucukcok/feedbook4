  <title>Megan&#39;s Tale - K.W. Steiner</title>
      <meta name="description" content="DESCRIPTION:&lt;br /&gt;
Megan makes a discovery about her young adult son that both angers and entices her. Having enjoyed the trappings of incest with her brother and his wife for many years, she is presented with an opportunity no mother should accept. Over the course of the holiday season, Megan learns the true meaning of mother-son bonding as they explore the world of incest together.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
EXCERPT:&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;You understand that we mustn&amp;#39;t be doing this,&amp;rdquo; she reminded her son in a faint voice, even as he moved nearer to her. &amp;ldquo;But if you&amp;rsquo;re willing, truly willing, to cross the line, then kneel for me, Patrick,&amp;rdquo; she told him. Entranced, Patrick followed his mother&amp;rsquo;s direction. He was now very near to her crotch, so close in fact that she could feel his warm breath on her slot. &amp;ldquo;Once we cross this line, Patrick, we can&amp;#39;t go back. It will never be like it was between us.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Patrick&amp;#39;s hands caress the outside of her thighs then, and he whispered, &amp;ldquo;I won&amp;#39;t want to go back, Mom.&amp;rdquo; He hesitated, his eyes fixed on her vagina just inches away, before his mouth descended onto her.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Ooohh, yeessss!&amp;rdquo; Megan moaned as her son&amp;#39;s warm mouth pressed into her heated pussy. &amp;ldquo;Yeessss!&amp;rdquo; she tossed her head back and groaned. She shuddered through a tremor as his tongue began to stroke up and down her slit. &amp;ldquo;Yeessss!&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Megan loved having her pussy licked, and for years her husband had treated her right. He had stopped after Arty had been born, and only ate her out when he was drunk and she pushed him into it. In her lifetime, Megan had been with a few guys who had gone down on her, but she had heard that men her age seemed to have given up eating out women, at least women her age. Before her son&amp;#39;s mouth had landed, it had been so long since a guy had licked her that she&amp;rsquo;d forgotten just how wonderful it felt. Her mind reeled as her pussy became the center of her sexual universe. Her ears buzzed as her son lapped hungrily upon her sexual flesh.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Ooohh, yes! Patrick, oh my god! That feels so good!&amp;rdquo; Megan had her hands on the back of his head and pulled him tighter to her pussy. His tongue wiggled against her vaginal opening, and then pushed up inside her. That set her off.&lt;br /&gt;
