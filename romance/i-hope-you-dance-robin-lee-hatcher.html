  <title>I Hope You Dance - Robin Lee Hatcher</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;They&amp;rsquo;ve helped orchestrate the perfect day for countless couples. Now twelve new couples will find themselves in the wedding spotlight in the second Year of Weddings novella collection.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Can two left feet lead to one perfect romance?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Grant Nichols is a genius in the kitchen and a klutz on the dance floor. But his friend&amp;rsquo;s wedding is shaping up to be a shindig the likes of which Kings Meadow has never seen&amp;mdash;including dancing. Lots of dancing. Then he learns that a local dance teacher, Skye Foster, is offering dance lessons for the wedding party. The lessons are free, so what does he have to lose?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A former rodeo queen, Skye Foster teaches children ballet and tap during the day, but with the popularity of ballroom dancing and her own love of Country Swing, she&amp;rsquo;s been teaching adults in the evenings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Grant comes from a family of ten siblings. He was the second oldest and believes he&#39;s had his fill of little rug rats. He&amp;rsquo;s happy with his bachelor state, despite the fact that he&amp;rsquo;s given up his ladies&amp;rsquo; man lifestyle. Even he admits to his wilder nature and has been trying to clean up his act, with God&#39;s help.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Skye, on the other hand, loves being around kids. She would love to find the right guy and settle down to have half a dozen children of her own.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Grant and Skye are no match on paper. But when they step onto the dance floor, they move to a love song all their own.&lt;/p&gt;" />
