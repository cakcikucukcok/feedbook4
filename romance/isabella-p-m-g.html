  <title>Isabella - P.M.G.</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;In pre-Civil War Georgia, a slave had no rights. Masters often took advantage of their female possessions. In the case of Ida, she was raped by Mr. Rhodes, the owner of the largest plantation in northern Georgia. This tryst brought about a child, but Rhodes made certain no one knew the child was his. He kept Ida quiet by sending young Isabella away to Richmond, Virginia, where, because of her mixed heritage, she was raised white.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At the age of eighteen, Isabella was thrown into the terrors of the Civil War. She worked as a nurse on the battlefield, taking care of wounded and dying men. Ronnie Braggs, Isabellas close friend, was always by her side through the tough times. They could have been a couple if Ronnie had been white, or if Isabella had known the truth about her family line. As it were, their relationship was forbiddenand very passionate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When their relationship changes from lust to love, it remains a secret. Isabella adores Ronnie, and she wishes they could be together forever; however, racism and war threaten to tear them apart as they hide their true feelings from family and friends. Will their love be discovered? Will the truth about Isabellas race surface and change everything? Or will the violence of war spell the end of their love, their lives, and all theyve fought to save?&lt;/p&gt;" />
