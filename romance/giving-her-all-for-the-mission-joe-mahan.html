  <title>Giving Her All for The Mission - Joe Mahan</title>
      <meta name="description" content="DESCRIPTION:&lt;br /&gt;
Maybe sending his daughter undercover as a porn star was a bad idea. Because at the moment? Ed Diamond couldn&amp;#39;t keep his dick under control. There was just something about that slutty schoolgirl outfit that his daughter was wearing...&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
EXCERPT:&lt;br /&gt;
Akira hated the outfit. The skirt barely covered her ass, hugging the curves of her cheeks, the fabric constantly slipping up between them. And the white shirt? That was even worse. The producers insisted that she tie it in a knot directly under her breasts. And they insisted, too, that she unbutton all but the bottom three buttons, so that her cleavage showed down to just above her nipples.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The tall white stockings and ultra-high-heeled shoes, the twin red bows in her hair and the pigtails? They completed the slutty schoolgirl look that the director of &amp;ldquo;Sarah Sells Cookies&amp;rdquo; was looking for.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Really?&amp;rdquo; Akira said, staring at herself in a full-length mirror. &amp;ldquo;Is this what guys really want?&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Laura, the set&amp;rsquo;s make-up artist, looked at Akira and smiled, patting the tip of Akira&amp;rsquo;s nose with a powder puff. &amp;ldquo;You kidding? I like it myself, and I&amp;rsquo;m not even a lesbian, at least not full-time. You&amp;rsquo;re fucking hot, girl.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Akira continued to stare at the full-length mirror. She had to admit &amp;ndash; at least in part &amp;ndash; that the make-up lady wasn&amp;rsquo;t entirely wrong. But Akira liked to think that this was more about her than it was the ridiculous outfit.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Her breasts? Well, Akira didn&amp;rsquo;t take credit for them. They were God-given. And, yes, they were impressive, even more so, Akira noticed, in the tight-fitting schoolgirl clothes she needed to wear on today&amp;rsquo;s assignment.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Baby, you&amp;rsquo;re a natural,&amp;rdquo; Laura said. &amp;ldquo;Can&amp;rsquo;t believe you haven&amp;rsquo;t done this before.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Akira looked down. Laura&amp;rsquo;s hand was resting lightly on her ass. Was this woman touching her on purpose? Or was it a stray hand? Surely, she&amp;rsquo;d seen plenty of porn stars before. Akira couldn&amp;rsquo;t be having any effect on her &amp;hellip; could she?&lt;br /&gt;
