  <title>Paul’s Vengeance - M.B. Linders</title>
      <meta name="description" content="DESCRIPTION:&lt;br /&gt;
A young man sacrifices himself to protect his family from a merciless business owner by being the owner&amp;#39;s cumdump.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
EXCERPT:&lt;br /&gt;
After lunch, we walked back to the front office and I got back into the background checks. After about 20 minutes, Emma popped her head into my office. She had a pensive look on her face. &amp;quot;He&amp;#39;s here, and he wants to see you. He doesn&amp;#39;t look like he&amp;#39;s in a good mood.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I rose from my desk, and started to walk out the door, but she stopped me. Handing me a little bottle, she said softly, &amp;quot;Go to the bathroom first and use this. I think you may need it.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I glanced down at the bottle she&amp;#39;d handed me, and saw that it was lubricant. My face blanched. &amp;quot;Uh, are you sure?&amp;quot; I asked, a tremble in my voice.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;I think so,&amp;quot; she answered. &amp;quot;Remember, you can do this. I have faith in you.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I almost walked into the men&amp;#39;s room before catching myself. It felt weird smearing the lubricant on my asshole. When Emma fucked me, she had coated her dick with the lube. I knew that Paul Douglas wouldn&amp;#39;t do that. Nervously, I left the bathroom and surreptitiously handed the bottle back to Emma. She could see my hand shaking as I did.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;You can do this,&amp;quot; she repeated. I nodded, trying to convince myself that I could do what I expected was about to happen.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I walked up to Paul&amp;#39;s door, and rapped on it hesitantly.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Come!&amp;quot; he replied, his voice harsher than usual. I stepped inside, and closed the door behind me.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Get those fucking clothes off and get over here,&amp;quot; he commanded. I undressed, hesitating when I was only wearing bra and panties.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Everything!&amp;quot; he almost yelled. I quickly got out of the bra and panties, then walked over to him.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
As I got closer, I saw that he had angry red furrows running down one cheek. &amp;quot;What happened to you?&amp;quot; I asked, slightly shocked.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Never you fucking mind,&amp;quot; he spat, grabbing my arm and spinning me around. He pushed me forward until my chest was resting on his desk. I clenched in fear as I heard his zipper come down and felt his dick against my ass. His hands found my hips, and he shoved himself into me.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
PAIN! INCREDIBLE PAIN!! He&amp;#39;d buried himself into me in one stroke, and the wave of pain that it caused was unbearable. The two times that I had Emma in me, she was slow and gentle and, while it hurt a little bit at first, it actually felt really good towards the end. Not so with Paul. He rammed himself balls-deep into me and began fucking me hard.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I tried to get away from him, but his grip on me was too tight. Babbling, I begged him to stop, begging him to use my mouth instead, anything that would stop the pain that was shrieking in my ass. Ignoring my pleas, he actually went harder and faster. My heels left the floor with every one of his thrusts." />
