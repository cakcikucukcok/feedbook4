  <title>Daddy, I&#39;m Ready For Your Cock! - Baby Angie</title>
      <meta name="description" content="DESCRIPTION:&lt;br /&gt;
A sweet, naive young girl discovers the hard way that deep down, all men are horny bastards! When she went to talk to daddy, she found out that dear old dad has 10 inches of fatherly advice he was going to give his princess. Uncut and unprotected!!!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
EXCERPT:&lt;br /&gt;
After ending the call, I sat and thought about men and why they act like babies when they can&amp;rsquo;t get sex. Just thinking about what Tommy did and where it would lead if I hadn&amp;rsquo;t stopped him made me sick.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I don&amp;rsquo;t claim to be a religious girl, but I do pride myself in being a moral person. The one thing I look for in a guy is integrity and the willingness to develop our relationship and hold off until marriage to have sex. As far as I am concerned, if they want sex so bad, then that means they really don&amp;rsquo;t care about me. There&amp;rsquo;s got to be more than just sex.&lt;br /&gt;
After fifteen minutes, I took out my phone and sent daddy a text, asking him what was taking him so long. As soon as I sent the text, I felt a hand on my shoulder.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Say, what&amp;rsquo;s a pretty girl like you doing out here by yourself?&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
A middle aged guy, with a suit and tie, stood over me, giving me an intense look which freaked me out.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;It&amp;rsquo;s none of your business and don&amp;rsquo;t touch me!&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
He chuckled. &amp;ldquo;Come on, you hookers can&amp;rsquo;t be making that much money to afford being rude to potential customers.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;What?&amp;rdquo; Did this douchebag call me a hooker?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Are you hard of hearing? Listen, I usually pay twenty for a blow job; cash. Let&amp;rsquo;s go to my car.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Listen asshole, my father&amp;rsquo;s coming to pick me up and I am not a hooker!&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Turning to see if anybody was nearby, the guy reached down and grabbed me by my hair and dragged me to his car. Before I could scream, another pair of hands stuffed a rag in my mouth and shoved a knife to my face. &amp;ldquo;Shut the fuck up if you know what&amp;rsquo;s good for you!&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Oh my, God, I was being kidnapped by two perverts.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Tossing me in the back seat of this white SUV, the first guy sat down next to me and took out a twenty dollar bill and shoved it down the front of my bra. &amp;ldquo;Let&amp;rsquo;s get the money out of the way first; I know how much you whores love cash.&amp;rdquo;" />
