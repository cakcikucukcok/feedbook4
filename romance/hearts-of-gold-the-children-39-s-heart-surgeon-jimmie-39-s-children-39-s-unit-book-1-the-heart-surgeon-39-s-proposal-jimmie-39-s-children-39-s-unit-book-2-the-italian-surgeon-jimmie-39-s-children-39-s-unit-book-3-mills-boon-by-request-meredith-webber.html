          &lt;strong&gt;The Children’s Heart Surgeon&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Top children’s surgeon Alex Attwood’s not been interested in women since the blonde stranger he kissed one night long ago and never found again. Yet the new manager, Annie Talbot, intrigues him; she has a different name from his mystery woman and dyes her hair brown, but one thing Annie can’t hide is her response to his kiss…&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;The Heart Surgeon’s Proposal &lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Maggie Walsh fell in love with handsome playboy Phil Park when they both joined the Children’s Cardiac Unit. But he never looked her way…until the night they fell into bed. Now Maggie is pregnant! But for all their sakes she won’t consent to a loveless marriage. No matter how passionately Phil tries to persuade her.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;The Italian Surgeon &lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Incredibly handsome Italian surgeon Luca Cavaletti only has eyes for Rachel Lerini. While Rachel is devoted to her job, Luca can sense that she’s suffering, but the closer he gets the more she runs away. This dedicated surgeon is determined to make Rachel smile and even love again…&lt;/p&gt;
