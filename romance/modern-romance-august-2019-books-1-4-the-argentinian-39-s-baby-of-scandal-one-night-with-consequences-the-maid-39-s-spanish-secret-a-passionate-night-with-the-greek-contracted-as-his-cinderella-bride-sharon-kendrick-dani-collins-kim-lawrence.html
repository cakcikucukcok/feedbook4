          &lt;strong&gt;The Argentinian’s baby of Scandal by Sharon Kendrick&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Housekeeper Tara Fitzpatrick is always as professional as possible. Until her billionaire boss, Lucas Conway, looks at her with a fiery intensity she just can’t resist. Only now Tara must tell this renowned bachelor that their night of passion had the most scandalous of consequences!&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Maid’s Spanish Secret by Dani Collins&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Sweet maid Poppy Harris shouldn’t have succumbed to Spanish aristocrat Rico Montero’s tantalizing seduction, but his touch was all consuming…and had a nine-month consequence! Poppy believes they could never be anything more. Until Rico appears on her doorstep demanding his hidden daughter—and Poppy!&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;A Passionate Night With the Greek by Kim Lawrence&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Greek tycoon Zach Gavros has one mission: to track down the long-lost granddaughter of the mentor who helped him rise from the streets of Athens to unrivalled success. But Zach quickly realises that Katina could be more trouble—and temptation—than anticipated!&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;Contracted as His Cinderella Bride by Heidi Rice&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;The perfect summer Ally Jones spent with gorgeous French billionaire Dominic LeGrand was unforgettable, despite her unrequited feelings. Now, Ally’s a struggling courier and is stunned when her latest delivery brings her to Dominic’s door. Yet, what’s even more shocking, is his proposal…!&lt;/p&gt;
