  <title>A Summer to Remember - Marilyn Pappano</title>
      <meta name="description" content="FIRST LOVE NEVER FADES . . .&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  It&#39;s been a long time since widow Fia Thomas felt the spark of physical attraction. But from the moment she meets Elliot Ross one stormy night, she yearns for a fresh start, for him to make her feel whole and well again. With his broad shoulders and a warm smile crinkling his dark eyes, he could finally offer her the solace she&#39;s been seeking. And she&#39;s willing to give him anything in return . . . except a promise that could break his heart.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  Now that Elliot is out of the Army, he&#39;s looking for a place to call home. Tallgrass was just a stop to stretch his legs, yet one look at Fia halts him in his tracks. In her sweet, sassy company, he finds the soul mate he never thought he&#39;d have. But Fia is holding something back-something that keeps her from making any plans. Elliot&#39;s new mission: gain Fia&#39;s trust...and convince her that summer&#39;s end can mean a new beginning." />
