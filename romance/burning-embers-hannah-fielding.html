  <title>Burning Embers - Hannah Fielding</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Coral Sinclair is a beautiful but naïve twenty-five-year-old photographer who has just lost her father. She&#39;s leaving the life she&#39;s known and traveling to Kenya to take ownership of her inheritance--the plantation that was her childhood home--Mpingo. On the voyage from England, Coral meets an enigmatic stranger to whom she has a mystifying attraction. She sees him again days later on the beach near Mpingo, but Coral&#39;s childhood nanny tells her the man is not to be trusted. It is rumored that Rafe de Monfort, owner of a neighboring plantation and a nightclub, is a notorious womanizer having an affair with her stepmother, which may have contributed to her father&#39;s death. Circumstance confirms Coral&#39;s worst suspicions, but when Rafe&#39;s life is in danger she is driven to make peace. A tentative romance blossoms amidst a meddling ex-fiancé, a jealous stepmother, a car accident, and the dangerous wilderness of Africa. Is Rafe just toying with a young woman&#39;s affections? Is the notorious womanizer only after Coral&#39;s inheritance? Or does Rafe&#39;s troubled past color his every move, making him more vulnerable than Coral could ever imagine? Set in 1970, this contemporary historical romance sends the seemingly doomed lovers down a destructive path wrought with greed, betrayal, revenge, passion, and love." />
