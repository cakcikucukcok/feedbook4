Betrayed and locked in a time vault, he has been sleeping for nearly two centuries when spunky historian Bree Kirkland inadvertently wakes him. She&#39;s more fearsome than the demon trying to kill him, and if he&#39;s not careful, she&#39;ll uncover the secrets his clan has bled and died to protect...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Could be the treasure she&#39;s been seeking all her life...&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Bree inherits an old treasure map, she discovers a warrior buried in her backyard. But the warrior isn&#39;t dead. Bree shocks Faelan with her modern dress and her boldness, and he infuriates Bree every time he tries to protect her.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With demons suddenly on the move, Bree discovers that Faelan&#39;s duty as protector is in his blood, and that her part in this fight was destined before she was born. But nothing is ever what it seems...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;An exciting, riveting read! Nothing&#39;s sexier than a timetraveling Highland warrior except one with the mission to save the world and the contemporary, courageous woman who lights his fire!
