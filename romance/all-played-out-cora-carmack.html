When he&amp;#8217;s not on the field, he excels at partying, girls, and more partying. As long as he keeps things light and easy, it&amp;#39;s impossible to get hurt... again. But something about the quiet, shy, sexy-as-hell Nell gets under his skin, and when he learns about her list, he makes it his mission to help her complete it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Torres is the definition of confident (And sexy. And wild), and he opens up a side of Nell that she&amp;#39;s never known. &amp;#160;But as they begin to check off each crazy, exciting,&amp;#160;&lt;em&gt;normal&lt;/em&gt;&amp;#160;item, Nell finds that her frivolous list leads to something more serious than she bargained for. And while Torres is used to taking risks on the field, he has to decide if he&amp;#39;s willing to take the chance when it&amp;#39;s more than just a game.&amp;#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Together they will have to decide if what they have is just part of the experiment or a chance at something real.&lt;/p&gt;" />
