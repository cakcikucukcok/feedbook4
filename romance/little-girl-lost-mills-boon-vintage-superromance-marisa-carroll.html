          &lt;strong&gt;Did Faith Carson steal his sister&#39;s baby?&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Hugh Damon is convinced that Faith&#39;s daughter is actually his sister Beth&#39;s missing baby. Just after Beth gave birth she was in a terrible car accident that caused her to lose her memory. Her newborn infant was never found.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Faith, widowed just before the birth, has told everyone she delivered her daughter at home during a devastating storm. Since she was alone, there&#39;s no one to confirm–or deny–her story. But there are too many coincidences to allow Hugh to believe her–as much as he finds himself wanting to.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;He has to admit that Faith is a great mother and that his teenage sister is in no shape to care for a child, but he still wants to know the truth. It&#39;s the only thing that might save his sister&#39;s sanity….&lt;/p&gt;
