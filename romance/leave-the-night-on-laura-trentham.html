  <title>Leave The Night On - Laura Trentham</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Love, betrayal, and sweet revenge--life in Cottonbloom is about to get a whole lot hotter in Laura Trentham&#39;s &lt;i&gt;Leave the Night On&lt;/i&gt; . . .&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Sutton Mize is known for lavishing attention on the customers who flock to her boutique on the wealthy side of her Mississippi town. So when she finds a lace thong in her fiancé&#39;s classic cherry-red Camaro, she knows just who she sold it to: her own best friend. In an instant, Sutton&#39;s whole world goes up in flames. . .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Wyatt Abbott has harbored a crush on Sutton since he was a young kid from the other side of the tracks. He witnessed Sutton&#39;s shocking discovery in the Camaro at his family-owned garage--and it made him angry. What kind of man could take lovely, gorgeous Sutton for granted? But then Sutton comes up with an idea: Why not give her betrothed a taste of his own medicine and pretend that she&#39;s got a lover of her own? Wyatt is more than happy to play the hot-and-heavy boyfriend. But what begins as a fictional affair soon develops into something more real, and more passionate, than either Sutton or Wyatt could have imagined. Could it be that true love has been waiting under the hood all along?&lt;/p&gt;" />
