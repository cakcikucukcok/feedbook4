  <title>The Seventh Night - Amanda Stevens</title>
      <meta name="description" content="It was a tropical paradise&amp;#133;that hid a relentless evil.&lt;Br&gt;&lt;Br&gt;Accountant Christine Greggory spends her days in the cool, logical realm of numbers. In her dreams, though, she’s tormented by blood-soaked visions of frenzied rituals and haunted by the undead. The terrors from her nightmares seep into her waking life when a mysterious message from her estranged father lures her to his Caribbean home.&lt;Br&gt;&lt;Br&gt;Christine’s father is missing, and Reid St. Pierre, her stepbrother, is the only person who can help her. But can she trust him? If his stepfather dies, Reid gains a fortune. And can she trust herself with him? The passion Reid stirs in Christine is as powerful as the Vodun drums that beat through the sweltering nights.&lt;Br&gt;&lt;Br&gt;Determined to track her father on her own, Christine finds herself in terrible danger. The closer she gets to the truth, the more convinced she becomes that Reid is behind her father’s disappearance&amp;#151;and that the man she’s fallen in love with is trying to kill her.&lt;Br&gt;&lt;Br&gt;Previously published." />
