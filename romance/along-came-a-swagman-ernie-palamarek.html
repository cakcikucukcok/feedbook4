  <title>Along Came a Swagman - Ernie Palamarek</title>
      <meta name="description" content="G&#39;day, Mate! The awesome Australian Outback is one of the beautiful but dangerous settings for this captivating tale of murky intrigue, murder and myths! Read this fascinating tale! It&#39;s a ripper, mate!&lt;BR&gt;
From out of the mists of Aboriginal Dreamtime, a startling discovery is made by a never-do-well Outback opal miner who hauls up a priceless archeological antiquity in a dented barrel of broken dreams. Paleontologists are astounded! One look at what he found is forever burned into the minds of those who see it, setting the stage for a devious web of deceit. Greed and lust change their lives forever! Millions of dollars are at stake!
&lt;P&gt;
Sally Fletcher, a tall strawberry-blonde Aussie who is a TV news reporter on Vancouver Island, is at a loss for words as her world comes crashing down upon her when someone starts systematically going after her, her grandfather, and her Canadian mother. It doesn&#39;t take a genius to figure out that her Australian father is next on somebody&#39;s list.
&lt;P&gt;
Rune Erikson is hot on the trail of a deadly trio of antiquity-stealing snakeheads who slither through the casinos Down Under! Rune wants to keep rolling sevens but the dice keep coming up snake-eyes!
Andy, an Outback swagman on a self-healing walkabout through the harsh conditions of the Outback, becomes embroiled in this adventure.
&lt;P&gt;
This fascinating third novel in a series features the somewhat-jaded but dashing Rune Erikson who rips through the Outback where hardships and timeless feats of courage are legend.
&lt;BR&gt;
Coloured by romance and eroticism, this intrigue lures Rune off his sailing ketch &lt;i&gt;Valhalla&lt;/i&gt; at Victoria&#39;s Fisherman&#39;s Wharf into the swirling myths and legends of Dreamtime in Australia&#39;s Outback." />
