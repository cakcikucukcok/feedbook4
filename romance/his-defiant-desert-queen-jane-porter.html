  	<div class="indent justify" style="visibility:hidden"><b><i>His Defiant Desert Queen - Jane Porter</i></b> | His Defiant Desert Queen by Jane Porter is such an enjoyable romance read to me. It flows of the pages and I loved the characters. It had a little different start than many other romance stories but after that I totally fell in love with the story. I loved all the well described scenes in the dessert and I was not disappointed.<br /><b><i>His Defiant Desert Queen by Jane Porter - Goodreads</i></b> | His Defiant Desert Queen. Necessity had taught Jemma Copeland to shut out distractions. She’d learned to ignore the things she didn’t want to think about, to enable her to do what needed to be done. So for the past two hours she’d ignored the scorching heat of the Sahara. The insistent, hollow ache in her stomach.<br /><b><i>His Defiant Desert Queen by Jane Porter</i></b> | The tension and the chemistry were amazing. Jane Porter did a wonderful job creating characters that were well thought out. The opulent Kasbah and the exotic desert setting were perfect. The story was well written and was filled with passion. I enjoyed His Defiant Desert Queen. I'm looking forward to the next book in The Disgraced Copelands series.<br /><p><h3 align="left">Download Ebook|PDF|Epub of <a href=>His Defiant Desert Queen - Jane Porter</a> </h3></p><hr/>
