      <meta name="description" content="&lt;b&gt;Have you ever thought some very dangerous thoughts?&amp;nbsp;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Ones that could destroy all life as you knew it?&lt;br /&gt;
In these six stories by three authors, they do just that. Of course, fiction is safer than real life, so it&amp;#39;s much easier to test things here. ...Or so we&amp;#39;ve been told.&lt;br /&gt;
In these stories are ideas that will captivate, and excite you to new thoughts and ideas of your own. Because the universe we live in is just a hair&amp;#39;s-breadth away from the fictional ones we create.&lt;br /&gt;
If history is any judge, these authors may be writing are things that will be in our own present any time now.&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;b&gt;Excerpt:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
(From &amp;quot;One Thought, Then Gone&amp;quot;)&lt;br /&gt;
I&amp;#39;D FIGURED IT ALL out by the first day as a high school sophomore. And I could care less. Because it wasn&amp;#39;t real. None of it.&lt;br /&gt;
Schooling was another trap built to &amp;quot;keep people safe.&amp;quot; And get them ready to have a job and accept the rat-race, wage-slave mentality.&lt;br /&gt;
Not that my parents or teachers or anyone else around could really understand what I was going through. They all just set it up as another &amp;quot;coming of age&amp;quot; drama that always played out. All the older siblings I inherited had made it through, somehow. In their own ways.&lt;br /&gt;
The trick was - I knew they were all part of the same trap.&lt;br /&gt;
I didn&amp;#39;t belong here, that I knew. And I was here to keep me safe from something far darker and more sinister than going on welfare, or being homeless, or doing illegal drugs and going to jail.&lt;br /&gt;
Something was out there much darker and more deadly than anything they could threaten me with. I could feel it in all my body from my bones to the lady parts that I was supposed to &amp;quot;think with&amp;quot; at this age.&lt;br /&gt;
I didn&amp;#39;t belong here.&lt;br /&gt;
And it became more and more obvious the more I tried to &amp;quot;fit in&amp;quot; by attempting to work out the customs and morality they all had. All the &amp;quot;now-you&amp;#39;re-supposed-to&amp;#39;s&amp;quot; that they probably filed in a non-existent loose leaf binder we were all issued when we were born.&lt;br /&gt;
The trick is that I wasn&amp;#39;t born. I had no memory of it. And all the things they told me I liked to do when I was a kid - I didn&amp;#39;t remember any of it. Because they were training me to just accept, just go along, just act on what they told me my memories were.&lt;br /&gt;
And they showed me &amp;quot;movies&amp;quot; of when I was younger. Filmed on something called &amp;quot;Super 8&amp;quot; and then later it was on &amp;quot;video tape.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
All made up to just reinforce the programming I&amp;#39;d been given along with this body.&lt;br /&gt;
Life wasn&amp;#39;t real. Life just sucked. Boyfriends, fashions, put-downs, come-ons, sports, band, gym, everything. Sucked.&lt;br /&gt;
Because it didn&amp;#39;t make sense. And the more sense I tried to make out of it, the worse it got.&lt;br /&gt;
Until I got a clue.&lt;br /&gt;
