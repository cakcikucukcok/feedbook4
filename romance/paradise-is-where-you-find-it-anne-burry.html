  <title>Paradise Is Where You Find It - Anne Burry</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Lillys life she decided had to change, her eighteen year marriage had come to an abrupt end when Carl had taken off with another woman.  Along with this, Lilly could no longer stomach the daily drudge of working in a job she hated in a city that left her empty and cold.
Her decision to move into the country to start a brand new life, took her into the realms of an existence she could never imagine.  Putting her finances into the local garden centre owned by a couple who had become her friends and were now retiring seemed simple enough and a way for her to follow her late mothers passion for growing orchids.   
Unwittingly this decision had pushed her quite literally into the arms of David Matthews a cool, confident man who was ruthless in business and in his pursuit of her.    She thought nothing of putting her trust in a man whos business was property but not only did he offer to help her deal with her purchase of the business he also took her to new heights of passion and lust that until then she had only  assumed was made up within the pages of a book.
What she hadnt anticipated was that through Davids ruthlessness she would become entangled into a dangerous web of hate, greed and a risk to her own life.  
In amongst all of the madness that had become Lillys life came the love of a man who had been so deeply hurt by the antics of David and his ex-wife Susan that it took the threat to Lillys life to show him that there remained some good in the world." />
