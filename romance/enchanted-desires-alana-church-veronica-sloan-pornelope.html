~~~~~ Excerpt ~~~~~&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;&amp;quot;He&amp;#39;s A Lesbian Now&amp;quot;&lt;/b&gt; - Brian and Jia have been best friends since they were children. Everyone says they&amp;#39;re perfect for each other. But the lovely Jia is a lesbian, and Brian...isn&amp;#39;t. Then one morning Brian wakes up to find himself in a brand new body! He isn&amp;#39;t Brian, but Brianna! Will he get his old body back? And with Jia starting to look at him in a whole new way, does he even want to?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;&amp;quot;The Woman Who Wasn&amp;#39;t&amp;quot;&lt;/b&gt; - Charlie Nelson is just walking down the street, minding his own business, when he&amp;#39;s suddenly killed in a brutal drive-by shooting...or is he? When he regains consciousness, he finds himself inhabiting a sexy teenage girl&amp;#39;s body. It can&amp;#39;t be true--he&amp;#39;s a strong, virile man! He doesn&amp;#39;t know a thing about being a woman--and he doesn&amp;#39;t want to learn! Then if that&amp;#39;s not bad enough, his lifelong best friend thinks he&amp;#39;s hot, and wants to pop his cherry. What else can possibly go wrong?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;&amp;quot;I Stole My Boss&amp;#39;s Body&amp;quot;&lt;/b&gt; - Sasha can&amp;#39;t stand her boss. Sure, Trent&amp;#39;s handsome as hell, but he&amp;#39;s got the manners of a pig! More than anything, she wishes she could put that arrogant, sexist egomaniac in his place. When her wish abruptly comes true, Sasha awakens to find herself in Trent&amp;#39;s body! Now she has all the power in the office and Trent must submit to her demands. And not only Trent, but Sasha&amp;#39;s slutty neighbor too..." />
