And all deliciously bad...&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Working undercover as part of an elite team of Rangers disguised as the Smokin&#39; ACES biker gang, Timothy Santos walks the thin line between law-enforcer and law-breaker. With one of his informants missing--and possibly dead--at the hands of vicious cartel leader El Brujo, Santos will do whatever it takes to find justice. Even if it means heading to Rio County to look up his former lover...who&#39;s not only the sheriff, but Santos&#39;s only lead.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Rose Renwick is not happy to see Santos. In the past, their chemistry had been explosive--raw, sensual, and unforgettable--but she&#39;d been burned. Now Santos is back in town, looking just as lethal and as irresistible as she remembered. But Santos wants something from her--and suddenly Rose&#39;s family is in danger and her town is under attack. The only way out is to trust the one man she swore never to trust again. Ante up...&lt;/p&gt;" />
