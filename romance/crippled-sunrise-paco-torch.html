  <title>Crippled Sunrise - Paco Torch</title>
      <meta name="description" content="It is 1957 when thirteen-year-old Frankie Paco Alexander meets his adoptive godfather, Don Mr. G DAmico, for the first time. Handicapped after a bout with spinal meningitis, Frankie is grateful to escape daily bullying and immerse himself in new friendships with Mr. Gs children. Mr. G treats Paco as one of his sons, especially after Paco trusts a foreboding feeling one day and saves Mr. G from certain death.
While Paco matures, Mr. G takes the boy under his wing and mentors him through lifes challenges. But when Paco finds love at age eighteen, he has no idea that Carols father is the godfather of another mob family. After he secretly marries her in Canada and she becomes pregnant, it seems Paco has finally found happiness. But when Mr. G arranges Carols murder, a grief-stricken Paco is transformed into a ruthless killer. Years later as the circle of life leads Paco to a confession with a childhood priest, he finds redemption and is led to unite factions of his Italian family into one of the worlds most powerful conglomerates.
Crippled Sunrise shares the saga of a young mans coming-of-age journey into manhood after he is adopted by a prominent godfather and discovers the good, bad, and ugly of the Mafia." />
