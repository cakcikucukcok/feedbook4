  <title>Synergy - Murray James</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Some people may think romance is dead. It isnt; it has just changed, along with the society we inhabit. Though this story would be viewed as a gay romance, that is not my main motivation in writing this book. It is intended to explore relationships in general. All relationships are different and unique. What is it that makes them work or not work? Synergy explores relationships through observations and comments via the many conversations and personal introspections and reflections of the two main characters.
The two central characters are an aging, very private, and semi-introverted Australian writer and a handsome young Spanish artist. Their personal histories, environments, family influences, and important life experiences are explored and discussed. What shaped these two people into who they now are? Why does their unlikely relationship seem to work so well? When by all reasonable logic, it most probably shouldnt.
This is the second volume in a trilogy. It continues on from the first published volume, Serendipity, where they meet on the Greek Island of Skopelos and are rapidly drawn together in a surprising and unforeseen set of circumstances.
Synergy follows their developing and deepening relationship as they travel extensively. First in Spain, where they marry; then to London, for an exhibition of the artists works; Australia; and finally sail from Spain back to their new villa on Skopelos. There is the occasional glitch and questioning concerning their relationship, but it ends quite positively as the two move into and set up their new villa overlooking the magnificent Aegean Sea. The continuation and evolution of their story and relationship in the third volume is alluded to in the last chapter. Each volume is written as a separate and complete story that may be read on their own or in sequence.
