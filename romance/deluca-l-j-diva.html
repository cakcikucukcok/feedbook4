  <title>DeLuca - L.J. Diva</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;The next instalment of L.J Diva&amp;rsquo;s Porn Star Brothers Series continues in DeLuca&amp;hellip;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Stephano DeLuca worked hard to become a world-famous bullfighter in his homeland of Spain. But after marrying Constance, and having their only child, Antonio, he also finds love in a surprising place, keeping it from his wife &lt;i&gt;and&lt;/i&gt; the bullfighting community.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Gay love is not appropriate in the &amp;rsquo;50s, let alone &amp;rsquo;60s and &amp;rsquo;70s, but Stephano finds a way, more so after his separation from Connie. While she finds passionate sex with a Greek Australian on Mykonos, he finds it with a multitude of lovers across the Mediterranean. Until one fling puts an end to his philandering ways &lt;i&gt;and&lt;/i&gt; his life.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Devastated, Connie cannot deal with the horrific legacy Stephano left behind and does the only thing she has any control over.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Antonio, unable to deal with his parent&amp;rsquo;s choices, does the only thing &lt;i&gt;he&lt;/i&gt; has control over, and leaves the DeLuca estate to his young son to inherit upon his 25th birthday, starting a new, &lt;i&gt;intimate&lt;/i&gt; legacy with a family the DeLuca&amp;rsquo;s know all too well&amp;hellip;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;i&gt;DeLuca&lt;/i&gt; is the fifth novel in the &lt;i&gt;Porn Star Brothers&lt;/i&gt; contemporary romance series featuring the sizzlingly sexy Spanish Colombian DeLuca family.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
If you like family sagas and decades-old dirty little secrets, then you&amp;rsquo;ll love L.J. Diva&amp;rsquo;s page-turning series.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Continue your love affair with &lt;i&gt;The Porn Star Brothers Series&lt;/i&gt; today!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
***These books contain swearing, sex, and a plotline. They&amp;rsquo;re for the over 18s only, but we all know those younger ones will sneak a peek.&lt;br /&gt;
