  <title>The Single Dad Next Door - Jessica Keller</title>
      <meta name="description" content="
        &lt;p&gt;Love Comes Home&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;All Maggie West has ever wanted is a family to call her own. But her new neighbor, single dad Kellen Ashby, is definitely &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; the man to make that dream come true. His daughters are sweet and silly, the kind of kids Maggie used to imagine having herself. But Kellen has just inherited the inn Maggie manages–her former family home–and the two butt heads at almost every turn. He&#39;s handsome, and clearly a devoted father, but with all the changes taking place, Maggie worries she may soon be jobless, homeless or both. At war with her emotions, Maggie will have to decide what truly matters–heart or home.&lt;/p&gt;
