  <title>Deceiver - Robin Lovett</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;The plan was to ruin a man&#39;s life. Not seduce the man&#39;s daughter.  But sometimes, the unlikeliest of people becomes the target. And sometimes revenge can make a man vulnerable in ways he didn&#39;t know existed...&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I&#39;m bored. Tired of my meaningless life. The garden parties, the white sundresses, and politely saying &quot;no&quot; to the sliver of cake--it&#39;s the life my mother and father wanted for me, worked tirelessly for me to have. And the monotony makes me reckless.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But when I go to Blake Vandershall&#39;s party, his dark, menacing eyes and his hard, unyielding stare make me want things that have never been offered to me before. He&#39;s the type who would ravish you in your father&#39;s law office. The kind who would lie without blinking an eye in order to get what he wants. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And the repressed bad girl in me wants to give him what he needs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; **&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Daisy Nowell is nothing to me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I don&#39;t care that underneath that blue-blood lifestyle, she&#39;s burning to be unleashed. My victim is her father--the one man who had the chance to save my mother from a brutal fate. The coward did nothing, and it&#39;s my turn to make his life a living hell. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He&#39;s about to lose his precious daughter to me, a man whose sole mission is to destroy him. I&#39;ll do anything, say anything, in order to tear this woman from her safe life as I hurtle down my path towards destruction. But I didn&#39;t count on her seeing through me. I didn&#39;t count on her tapping into my weaknesses, pushing my dark heart in ways I don&#39;t want. Ways I hate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I need to find a way to exact my vengeance and leave this all behind. Before this woman ruins me for good.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Stranger by Robin Lovett is a dark and intriguing story about the lengths one will go to find love. A page turner from the very beginning, this story makes you question, in the best of ways, what a romance is. A five star read!&quot; - &lt;i&gt;USA Today &lt;/i&gt;bestselling author Jenika Snow on &lt;i&gt;Stranger&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Wowza! I just couldn&#39;t put this down.&quot; - &lt;i&gt;The Jeep Diva &lt;/i&gt;on &lt;i&gt;Stranger&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&quot;&lt;i&gt;Stranger&lt;/i&gt; quite boldly goes where many romances don&#39;t go...about the blurred boundaries between depravity, pleasure and despair, and how freedom...can be found in the most unexpected places.&quot; - &lt;i&gt;Unstuck Pages &lt;/i&gt;on &lt;i&gt;Stranger&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is a series of standalones by Robin Lovett that can be read separately or in this order:&lt;br&gt;Book 1: Stranger, a dark stalker romance &lt;br&gt;Book 2: Deceiver, a dark revenge romance&lt;br&gt;Book 3: Keeper, a dark captive romance (coming 8/15)&lt;/p&gt;" />
