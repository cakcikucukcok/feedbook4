Now available for the first time as a complete book, this edition features sizzling new bonus material.&lt;br&gt;Jessica&#39;s life was in ruins...until she met &lt;i&gt;him&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;br&gt;Standing in the rain feeling lost in a new city, with no job and no prospects, she&#39;s about to give up. Until Dane Rainier pulls up in his limo and offers her a ride--and sweeps her into the life of her dreams. Now she has a high-powered job and is having the best sex of her life, exploring her submissive side under the masterful hand of a gorgeous billionaire.&lt;br&gt;But there&#39;s a part of her that&#39;s still holding back.

Now Storm is about to reappear and turn her whole world upside down. Both Dane and Storm make her body burn to be possessed, but will her indecisive heart cost her the love of both men?&lt;/p&gt;" />
