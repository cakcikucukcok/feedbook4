  <title>The Wrangler&#39;s Woman (Mills &amp; Boon Temptation) - Ruth Jean Dale</title>
      <meta name="description" content="
        &lt;p&gt;When the Keene triplets pulled up stakes and moved to Texas, they had no idea what they were getting into. The dude ranch they&#39;d inherited was a wreck, plus, the townsfolk were downright hostile toward &quot;that old reprobate Wil Keen&#39;s kin.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Dani Keene, &quot;the smart one,&quot; was determined to succeed regardless. All she needed were some brawny Texas hired hands to put things right. Only one man came forward–Jack Burke.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Jack was six feet of long, lean, sexy Texas cowboy and the answer to Dani&#39;s prayers–in more ways than one. Still, she couldn&#39;t help thinking he was just too good to be true….&lt;/p&gt;
