Using the pseudonym Eagle Eye to hide his identity, he is free to wield his finger pointing, no-holds-barred articles at leisure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jillian Jeffrey, teen fashion industry&amp;rsquo;s latest darling, has a heart for the less fortunate. Her goal is to raise enough money for fashion icon Anna Delany&amp;rsquo;s, Like No Other charity foundation. The donation will not only keep the charity afloat, but will place Jill in the running for a coveted position on LNO&amp;rsquo;s board of directors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a moment of weakness, at the charity gala, Jill reluctantly accepts a bet from her ex-boyfriend and uses a homeless man to raise twenty thousand dollars. Unknown to Jill, the homeless guy is the cynical, undercover journalist, and Jill has just become his latest expos&amp;eacute; target.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a twist of fate, Cameron is soon hired to shadow Jill as she volunteers with the charity. Shorthaired and clean-shaven, he looks nothing like the bearded, disheveled man Jill had encountered the night of the gala. During their time together, he not only discovers the noble reason behind the bet, but witnesses first hand his article&amp;rsquo;s negative impact on her business. Faced with the prospect of losing her, will Cameron come up with an antidote for Eagle Eye&amp;rsquo;s toxic expos&amp;eacute; before Jill loses everything she&amp;rsquo;s worked for?&lt;/p&gt;" />
