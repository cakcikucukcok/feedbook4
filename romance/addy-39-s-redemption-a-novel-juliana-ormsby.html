  <title>Addy&#39;s Redemption: A Novel - Juliana Ormsby</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Addison Blake is thoroughly convinced there is no gray area when it comes to luck - either you&#39;re born with it or you&#39;re not.  She frequently notices the happy, fortunate people and wonders why she was not destined to be one of them. Orphaned after a tragic accident killed her parents, Addy is left with no one to raise her except two maiden aunts, both humorless and fanatically devout Catholics. A bright star in Addy&#39;s life is a spunky schoolmate, Helena, of whom the aunts completely disapprove because Helena&#39;s mother is divorced. By pulling their niece away from all that they perceive to be sinful and tainted, the aunts map out Addy&#39;s future as a dutiful wife to Lionel, a man they are convinced will make the perfect Catholic husband.    &lt;br&gt;Rather than finding peace and comfort in Catholicism, Addy silently rages at what she perceives to be a sadistic, unfair God, who has left us to our own devices and allows horrific suffering for some people.  Highly intelligent and sensitive, Addy escapes from her grim reality into a rich world of fantasy.  Her tendency to daydream often gets her into trouble, particularly with her verbally and physically abusive &quot;perfect&quot; husband.  Little does the cruel, boorish Lionel know that he is the very reason Addy wants to escape. &lt;br&gt;After moving away at a young age, Helena, the once &quot;forbidden fruit&quot; returns to town for her mother&#39;s funeral. Now, Helena is wealthy and well-known. Addy never dreams that Helena would want to associate with her, but Lionel has ulterior motives and forces Addy to foster the friendship. Astute and sophisticated, Helena sees right through the situation but secretly chooses to rekindle her friendship with Addy on her own terms while convincing Lionel he is the hero he wants to be. &lt;br&gt;Helena and Addy are complete opposites, yet they are sisters of the heart. Each has an appreciation for the other&#39;s qualities. The brazen, worldly Helena can&#39;t bear to see her soul mate suffer at the hands of such a loutish husband and schemes to murder him. However, even the best laid plans often go awry. Not even Helena could foresee how deceit, decadence, and death would change their lives forever.  &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;u&gt;About the Author&lt;/u&gt;:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Dr. Juliana Ormsby was born in New England into a large working-class immigrant family.  While Juliana was growing up, opportunities for women were limited, particularly those from her socio-economic background.  Juliana defied the odds and won a scholarship to a prestigious women&#39;s college.  During her undergraduate years, the author came across people and things very different from her upbringing.  To quench her thirst for wider knowledge, she went on to pursue advanced degrees as well as live and work in different cultures in many parts of the world.  &lt;br&gt;A good listener with a keen memory, Dr. Ormsby gathered stories wherever she went.  Her first novel, &lt;i&gt;Addy&#39;s Redemption&lt;/i&gt;, is fictional but based upon the experiences of people Dr. Ormsby has encountered throughout her life&#39;s journey." />
