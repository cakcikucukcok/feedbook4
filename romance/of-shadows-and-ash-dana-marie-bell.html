  <title>Of Shadows and Ash - Dana Marie Bell</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;em&gt;Book three of Maggie&amp;#39;s Grove&lt;/em&gt;&lt;Br&gt;&lt;Br&gt;Overprotective dryad Ashton Ward is pissed off. His mate Selena has been tortured by humans who hunt supernaturals, and she&amp;#39;s flat-out refusing to let him near her as she heals. Her magic is so compromised that just being near her puts him in danger, but he&amp;#39;s sure he can help ease her pain if she&amp;#39;ll just let him.&lt;Br&gt;&lt;Br&gt;To keep Ash safe, witch doctor Selena Giannone wants to handle the fallout from her nightmare alone. But she might be dealing with more than the agonizing loss of her powers&amp;#151;something&amp;#39;s haunting her house so badly &lt;em&gt;the land itself&lt;/em&gt; is afraid. A demon so powerful nothing in Maggie&amp;#39;s grove can tame it alone.&lt;Br&gt;&lt;Br&gt;Terrified, exhausted and out of options, Selena turns to Ash for help. The enemy needs two things to feed: Selena&amp;#39;s powers, yes, but also it needs her fear. And if there&amp;#39;s a magic that can save her, it lies with Ash&amp;#151;with his touch, and with their bond.&lt;Br&gt;&lt;Br&gt;84,000 words" />
