  <title>As Close As Sisters - Colleen Faulkner</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Since the age of twelve, McKenzie Arnold has spent every summer at Albany Beach, Delaware, with her best friends Aurora, Janine, and Lilly. The seaside house teems with thirty years of memories--some wonderful, others painful--and secrets never divulged beyond its walls. This summer may be the last they spend together, as Janine contemplates selling her family cottage.&lt;P&gt;For now, all four enjoy morning beach walks and lazy evenings on the porch, celebrating Lilly&#39;s longed-for pregnancy and offering support during McKenzie&#39;s greatest crisis. It&#39;s a time for laughter and recriminations, a time to forge a new understanding of a long-ago night when Aurora sealed their bond with one devastating act. And as the days gradually shorten, events will unfold in ways that none of them could have predicted, to make this the most momentous summer of all. &lt;P&gt;In a deeply moving novel filled with heartbreak and warmth, Colleen Faulkner explores the complex ties between four very different women as they move through life together, and apart. &lt;P&gt; &lt;B&gt;Praise For Colleen Faulkner&#39;s Just Like Other Daughters&lt;/B&gt;&lt;P&gt;&quot;This deeply moving story of maternal love and renewal will touch your heart. It&#39;s a celebration of the capacity of the human heart to heal itself and embrace change, beautifully written with rare insight.&quot; --Susan Wiggs, # 1 &lt;I&gt;New York Times &lt;/I&gt;bestselling author&lt;P&gt;&quot;Be prepared to weep tears of sorrow as well as tears of joy. This is a novel you won&#39;t soon forget.&quot; --Holly Chamberlin, author of &lt;I&gt;Last Summer&lt;/I&gt;&lt;P&gt;&quot;&lt;I&gt;Just Like Other Daughters &lt;/I&gt;was so real, so honest.  .  .I laughed, I hoped, I cried.  It&#39;s that good.&quot; --Cathy Lamb, author of &lt;I&gt;Henry&#39;s Sisters&lt;/I&gt;" />
