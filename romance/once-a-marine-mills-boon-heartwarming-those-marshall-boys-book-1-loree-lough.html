            &lt;em&gt;Does she even need a hero?&lt;/em&gt;
          &lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Summer Lane is no damsel in distress. For the past two years, she&#39;s been battling her way back from her worst nightmare all by herself. So she doesn&#39;t need the fabulous former Marine Zach Marshall swooping in to save her.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;But she needn&#39;t worry. Zach has hung up his shining armor. His instinct to rescue has only brought him heartache, and he&#39;s not about to risk it all again - even though everything about Summer makes him yearn to help. But she just might accept his challenge to step up and conquer her fears on her own. Even her deepest fears, like trust…and love.&lt;/p&gt;
