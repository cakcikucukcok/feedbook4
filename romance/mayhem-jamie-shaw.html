  <title>Mayhem - Jamie Shaw</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;When college freshman Rowan Michaels meets gorgeous, up-and-coming rock star Adam Everest, she knows a player like him is the last thing she needs after her ex-boyfriend shattered her heart. But she can&#39;t stop thinking about the kiss they shared on his tour bus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the first day of school, Rowan is stunned when Adam saunters into her French class. He&#39;s soon failing miserably, and, on a whim, she offers to tutor him. But Adam doesn&#39;t recognize her as a makeup-free, glasses-clad college student&amp;#8212;a far cry from the beautiful, mysterious &quot;Peach&quot; he met at his concert.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During a wild weekend on tour with the band, Rowan can&#39;t help falling for the sweet guy buried beneath Adam&#39;s rocker persona. Yet she knows she could never compete with the girls constantly throwing themselves at his feet. She&#39;d just end up hurt &amp;#8230; again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Peach is all Adam thinks about, though, and when Rowan realizes this, she has a decision to make: stay just friends to protect her fragile heart &amp;#8230; or reveal the truth about the night they met and admit she&#39;s fallen completely, hopelessly in love with him.&lt;/p&gt;" />
