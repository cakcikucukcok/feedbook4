  <title>Night of the Were-Bimbo - Alana Church</title>
      <meta name="description" content="A month ago, Susan Benton was attacked on her way home by a crazy woman. Now, the full moon is rising again, and with it, Susan&amp;#39;s body and mind are changing! No longer plain old Susan, but hot, horny Suzie, she will have it all!

&lt;br /&gt;
~~~~~ PG Excerpt ~~~~~&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Laurie didn&amp;#39;t look up from her book when she opened up the door. &amp;quot;Well, that didn&amp;#39;t take long. Was Reynolds not there? Or did he give you a straight answer for a change? I haven&amp;#39;t heard from...&amp;quot; her voice trailed off in shock as Suzie walked into the living room, then she bounced to her feet. &amp;quot;Who are you?&amp;quot; she demanded. &amp;quot;How did you get in here?&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Lauren Wu.&amp;quot; Suzie put her hands on her hips. &amp;quot;We&amp;#39;ve lived together for the last three years. And I&amp;#39;ve got a key.&amp;quot; She waved it at her friend. &amp;quot;Who do you think I am?&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Holy cow. Susan?&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;I think I like Suzie better.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;What the heck...&amp;quot; Her eyes took in her face, her hair, her body, lingering on her chest. &amp;quot;What happened to you?&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;The moon blessed me.&amp;quot; She looked out the east-facing window. Her lady was higher now, her silvery glow caught in the branches of the maple next door like a fish in a net, and her power was lessened by the lights inside the apartment. But her light was still enough to make her almost writhe in ecstasy. &amp;quot;She called, and I answered. My body drank in her light, and now I&amp;#39;m different. Hotter. Sexier.&amp;quot; Her voice dropped to a low growl. &amp;quot;Aroused.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Susan.&amp;quot; Laurie stepped forward, taking her wrists in her hands. &amp;quot;Do you have any idea how crazy that sounds? The moon can&amp;#39;t...the moon can&amp;#39;t change your body! It&amp;#39;s just the moon!&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Oh, why so serious?&amp;quot; She booped Laurie&amp;#39;s nose, just for fun. &amp;quot;Boop. Who cares? I&amp;#39;ve got a great big old set of boobs right now and they are awesome. And look at my legs!&amp;quot; She pulled down the straps of her dress, letting it fall to the floor. &amp;quot;I mean, come on! Who cares how it happened, am I right?&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Yeah. Right.&amp;quot; Laurie looked away, her dark skin flushing.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Hey, sweetie.&amp;quot; She cocked her head in confusion. &amp;quot;What&amp;#39;s wrong?&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Nothing.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Suzie was confused, but then her nose caught a musky tang in the air.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The scent of an aroused woman.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
She wants me. Her body grew hot and sweaty, slick with renewed desire. I bet she knows how to take care of a woman. Unlike stupid old Professor Reynolds. &amp;quot;Laurie? Are you horny for me?&amp;quot;" />
