  <title>Cowboy, Interrupted - Missy Harper</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Six-time world champion bull rider, Ethan Hawkins, is riding the high life. He&#39;s at the top of his game with money in his pocket, a nation wide endorsement deal, and a different woman in his bed every night. He&#39;s loving life and living the cowboy dream, but it all come crashing down around him with one devastating phone call from home. Ethan knows leaving the pro tour means his ride is over, his endorsements gone, and a lifetime of responsibilities lay ahead of him. He heads back to Montana with a heavy heart and finds his ranch near financial ruin, himself unrecognizable to his ailing father, and his best friends little sister at the center of all his problems.
Rylee Van der Brook was nothing more than a strange looking, mouthy, feisty little tag along when Ethan left for the pro tour. Now, she&#39;s all grown up, more gorgeous than any woman has a right to be, and not at all interested in following Ethan anywhere...or at least that&#39;s what she&#39;d like everyone to believe. Refusing to become just another notch on the belt of the man she&#39;s loved her entire life, Rylee embarks on a mission to keep Ethan at a distance, not fall into his dangerous web of temporary affections, and finally start her life, without Ethan at its center. The major flaw with her plan is that it leaves Ethan furious, frustrated and fantasizing about a woman he has no business wanting. When they find themselves alone in Las Vegas, not everything that happens in Vegas will stay in Vegas." />
