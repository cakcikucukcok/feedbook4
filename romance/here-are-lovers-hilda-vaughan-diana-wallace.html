  <title>Here Are Lovers - Hilda Vaughan, Diana Wallace</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Bored and frustrated with the restricted life of a Victorian young lady, Laetitia encounters the romance she so longs for when she becomes lost during a clandestine night-time ride and is rescued by Gronwy. Attempting to assist Gronwy&#39;s ambitions by lending him books from her father&#39;s library, Laetitia becomes increasingly aware of her own disempowerment and the passionate desires which drive her into a love affair with him. Their secret meetings are paralleled with the tender relationship developing between Gronwy&#39;s brother Peter, and another local farmer&#39;s daughter, Elizabeth Evans. After Gronwy is imprisoned for inciting a riot at the local by-election, the novel moves inexorably towards its tragic ending at the local &#39;Wishing Chair&#39;, a throne-like slab of rock above the river where the lovers meet. Opening in the spring of 1866, Here are Lovers is set in &#39;Llangantyn&#39;, Radnorshire and was originally published in 1926, the year of the General Strike - it is one of the few novels to centre on an election.Bored and frustrated with the restricted life of a Victorian young lady, Laetitia encounters the romance she so longs for when she becomes lost during a clandestine night-time ride and is rescued by Gronwy.
