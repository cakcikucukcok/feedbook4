          &lt;strong&gt;
            &lt;em&gt;Readers have fallen in love with the town and people of Fool&#39;s Gold in Susan Mallery&#39;s New York Times bestselling series. Meet her latest couple in this special Fool&#39;s Gold novella!&lt;/em&gt;
          &lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Fayrene Hopkins may be only twenty-four years old, but she runs her own business and has big plans—plans that don&#39;t involve falling in love yet. She&#39;s determined to make her mark on the world before settling down. She thinks she&#39;s got life all figured out—until she meets Ryan Patterson on her latest job.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Fayrene senses his interest in her, and she has to admit he gets her pulse racing. Luckily, starting a relationship with Ryan is safe—he&#39;s leaving Fool&#39;s Gold when his work contract is up. Ryan has goals of his own and a job waiting for him in Texas.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;He doesn&#39;t expect to get waylaid by a sassy blonde and cozy town. But what started out as temporary is starting to look like the real thing. If only he can convince Fayrene that some plans are made to be broken.&lt;/p&gt;
