  <title>My Fair Highlander - Mary Wine</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Jemma Ramsden is a wild thing in a noblewoman&#39;s body-so thinks Gordon Dwyre, Laird Barras, watching her galloping on horseback through her brother&#39;s lands. Bold, headstrong, beautiful: the perfect bride for a lusty Scots warrior. He might be able to convince her, too, if she would hear his suit. But Barras doesn&#39;t wait to be handed what he wants. When he&#39;s forced to rescue her from English ruffians, he makes sure she stays safe-by locking her in his castle.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Jemma is hardly an eager captive. She has no horse and no freedom, and she is an Englishwoman in a hostile Scots keep: a stranger without work or friend. Barras seems determined to charm her-even tempt forbidden desires, a daring game that leaves Jemma desperate for more. But with passion, love, and a new life within her grasp, Jemma is in more danger than even she knows.  .  .&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Praise for the Novels of Mary Wine&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&quot;.  .  .delightful characters and a charming romance.  .  .definitely a must-read.&quot; -Heather Graham on &lt;i&gt;In Bed with a Stranger&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&quot;A bold and lusty hero, a brave heroine, and intrigue at the royal court of Scotland.  .  .sexy and exciting as the Highland hills themselves!&quot; -Elizabeth Hoyt on &lt;i&gt;In the Warrior&#39;s Bed&lt;/i&gt;" />
