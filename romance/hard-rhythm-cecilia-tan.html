      <meta name="description" content="Are they ready to go all the way?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  Maddie Rofel has seen it all. Even the kinkiest games she witnesses working as a hostess in L.A.&#39;s most exclusive private sex club fail to shock her, much less turn her on. Until the night she has a very personal encounter with drummer Chino Garcia, and the two discover an intimate connection neither can deny. Suddenly the jaded hostess is softening under Chino&#39;s touch, and submitting in ways she never expected . . . &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  All his life, Chino has been running from something. Normally he beats back his demons by losing himself in his music. Now he&#39;s losing himself in Maddie. And, while it drives Chino wild when Maddie bares her body to him, what he really wants is for Maddie to bare her soul. For that, Chino will have to push Maddie past her furthest limits-and share his own dark secrets." />
