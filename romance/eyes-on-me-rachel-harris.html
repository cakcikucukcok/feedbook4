  <title>Eyes on Me - Rachel Harris</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Look up the word &quot;nerd&quot; and you&#39;ll find Lily Bailey&#39;s picture. She&#39;s got one goal: first stop valedictorian, next stop Harvard. Until a stint in the hospital from too much stress lands her in the last place a klutz like her ever expected to be: salsa dance lessons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Look up the word &quot;popular&quot; and you&#39;ll find Stone Torres&#39;s picture. His life seems perfect--star of the football team, small-town hero, lots of friends. But his family is struggling to make ends meet, so if pitching in at his mom&#39;s dance studio helps, he&#39;ll do it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Lily&#39;s dad offers Stone extra cash to volunteer as Lily&#39;s permanent dance partner, he can&#39;t refuse. But with each dip and turn, each moment her hand is in his, his side job starts to feel all too real. Lily shows Stone he&#39;s more than his impressive football stats, and he introduces her to a world outside of studying. But with the lines blurred, can their relationship survive the secret he&#39;s been hiding?&lt;/p&gt;" />
