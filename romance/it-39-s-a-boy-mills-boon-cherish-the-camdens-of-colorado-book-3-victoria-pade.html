        &lt;p&gt;Daddy Dilemma!&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Lang Camden’s just found out he’s a dad (and the sole guardian)… of a rambunctious two-year-old. He’s never changed a nappy in his life – what’s a man to do? Enter Heddy Lanrahan, the widowed baker who’s as luscious and sweet as her cheesecakes. Lang’s on a mission to help her business and Heddy willingly lends a helping hand with his child.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;The chemistry between them is off the charts – but the history between their two families is complicated and, if Heddy lets herself fall for this man and his little boy, she could lose everything!&lt;/p&gt;
