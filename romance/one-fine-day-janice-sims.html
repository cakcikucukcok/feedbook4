But not knowing the truth is tearing him apart.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Six years ago Sara was at her lowest ebb, until Aminatu&#39;s Daughters&amp;#151;a secret organization that helps women and children in jeopardy&amp;#151;gave her life purpose again. Now Sara faces an impossible choice between the man she adores and  her  dangerous  but  rewarding  work.
