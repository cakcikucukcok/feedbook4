  <title>Mistress - Leda Swann</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;She knew she was playing with fire . . . and was eager to burn.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The very thought of an innocent young woman&amp;#8212;a teacher at a fusty finishing school&amp;#8212;modeling for a series of titillating photographs to be sold at London&#39;s bookstalls is scandalous. But orphaned Emily Clemens&#39;s destitute circumstances have left her little choice. It is all part of her plan to capture the attention of some well-heeled rou&amp;#233; who will then make her his pampered mistress. So the untouched beauty sheds her outer garments&amp;#8212;and her inhibitions&amp;#8212;to strike provocative poses before the lens of handsome photographer Eric Twyford.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But each seductive attitude she assumes is stoking a fire within that Emily never knew existed&amp;#8212;and the heat is spurring her on to ever-greater heights of sensuous abandon. Still, the devilishly desirable Eric, a consummate professional, remains unmoved by her erotic display. If Emily cannot arouse a man in the flesh, what hope does she have as a black-and-white postcard?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She has already gone far beyond the boundaries of propriety. Now Emily&#39;s brazenly determined to go even farther&amp;#8212;to seduce Eric, letting him take her to intoxicating places she has never been. But once she has reached ecstasy, will she ever be able to leave? &lt;/p&gt;" />
