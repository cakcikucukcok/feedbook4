  <title>The Nemesis Affair - Erin McCarthy</title>
      <meta name="description" content="
        &lt;p&gt;Former rugby player Liam Kelly wants to keep his edge without losing his cool. The sexy Irishman needs someone to help him work out a little healthy aggression outside the office so he’ll avoid punching his difficult boss.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;He needs an adversary who will goad him, insult, and drive him. Someone to push his limits. What he needs is a professional nemesis. So when Sam responds to his online ad with plenty of cheek and smart-assedness, Liam knows he&#39;s found the perfect guy.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Except Sam isn’t a guy.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;She’s Samantha Hess. Very much female, newly unemployed, and eager to turn up the volume on her “nice girl” image. Goading Rugby Boy through texts and emails to run an extra mile each day is like therapy for assertiveness – and she’ll get paid. She just needs to convince Liam &quot;Samantha&quot; can get the job done just as well as &quot;Sam&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Samantha’s a a smokin’ hot, sassy woman with a girl-next-door vibe who doesn’t have a problem challenging Liam mentally. But how can he take her seriously now, when all he can think about is convincing her that his next workout should be in her bed?&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;And how will Sam keep her adversarial edge – and her heart – safe from the man who’s her perfect match?&lt;/p&gt;
