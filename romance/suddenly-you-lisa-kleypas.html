But gently-bred Amanda craved respectability more than she admitted, while Jack, the cast-off son of a nobleman and London&amp;#8242;s most notorious businessman, refused to live by society&amp;#8242;s rules. Yet when fate conspired for them to marry, their worlds collided with a passionate force neither had expected...but both soon craved.&lt;/p&gt;" />
