  <title>Mom Sucks at Strip Poker - Callie Robles</title>
      <meta name="description" content="DESCRIPTION:&lt;br /&gt;
Mark is making a fortune playing poker instead of going to college, but when his mom finds out, she freaks out and gives her son an ultimatum. He has the perfect solution--a game of strip poker to decide once and for all if Mark has what it takes to win the jackpot and his mom&amp;#39;s honeypot!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
EXCERPT:&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;What are you doing?&amp;rdquo; She asked. &amp;ldquo;You are throwing away your future with cheap card tricks! I should have spent your college money on lottery tickets for all the good that it&amp;rsquo;ll do you.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Mom!&amp;rdquo; I said. &amp;ldquo;Poker is a game of skill. I can beat almost anyone at the table.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I was getting angry with her. I was already pissed off and horny because I thought that I would be fucking my now ex-girlfriend tonight. I made 1,100 dollars and I wanted to celebrate by going balls deep in a wet pussy.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Please.&amp;rdquo; She waved off my words. &amp;ldquo;It&amp;rsquo;s random like a slot machine. It&amp;rsquo;s all a joke that playing poker takes skill.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;You think you can beat me?&amp;rdquo; I asked. &amp;ldquo;Why don&amp;rsquo;t you put your money where your mouth is?&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;ve been paying your tuition!&amp;rdquo; She squawked. &amp;ldquo;I don&amp;rsquo;t have any extra money.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
She was incandescent with rage, but I noticed she was not wearing a bra. That gave me an idea that would solve both of my problems.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Fine. We&amp;rsquo;ll play strip poker.&amp;rdquo; I said.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Are you kidding me?&amp;rdquo; She sounded shocked but no longer angry. My mom&amp;rsquo;s eyes skittered down my chest to my crotch and back up to my eyes again.&lt;br /&gt;
