  <title>Just Another Lonely Knight - Carrie L. Macon</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt; THOMAS ERROL&lt;/STRONG&gt; &lt;STRONG&gt;KNIGHT...&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;graduated high school with top honors and a football scholarship to the school of his choice. He chose Morehouse. Graduating with a business degree in one hand and being drafted by the Green Bay Packers were more than he had ever imagined. He went on to play three years leading his team to two championship victories.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt; ...SINGLE, ACCOMPLISHED...&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;feeling unfulfilled, he ditched the helmet and pads, took his business degree and turned it into a multimillion dollar brokerage firm, in Nashville Tennessee. The success of that company opened many doors, allowing him to open a new firm in the downtown area of his home town of Riley, Louisiana. Business was good. He made just as much money as he had playing pro ball, and without the injuries. Butstill, itwasn&#39;t enough.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt; ...AND WITHOUT LOVE.&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Something was missing.A life beyond the job, a family to go home to at the end of the day, something that said he wasn&#39;t alone. Things looked hopeless for the most part, until a chance meeting with his high school sweetheart sparked flames that was once there. He wanted nothing more than to rekindled the love they had once shared.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Could Thomas convince this woman that his childhood behavior had not followed him into adulthood, or would the antics of a jilted ex-lover prove to be his down fall and their doomed relationship.&lt;/P&gt;" />
