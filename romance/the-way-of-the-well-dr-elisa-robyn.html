  <title>The Way of the Well - Dr. Elisa Robyn</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&quot;Everything that has happened to you, every life choice you have made, every road you have traveled has led without deviation to this point, to this moment. I have known who you were for years, even watched you as you grew. When I saw your face in the wine glass at the new moon I knew you were ready and it was time to contact you. The final choice is yours. I offer to guide you to the path of your divine purpose, but only you can take the first step, only you can commit to the journey.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;   
These words from the old woman in the synagogue begin the adventure of Rachel Cohen&#39;s life; a journey that will take her through the ten gateways that guard Miriam&#39;s Well. In the classic tradition of a heroine&#39;s journey she finds friends and mentors, challenges and dangers, family and romance, and her life purpose. A richly written spiritual romance, with real characters and surprising twists." />
