  <title>To Tempt A Stallion (Mills &amp; Boon Kimani) (The Stallions, Book 11) - Deborah Fletcher Mello</title>
      <meta name="description" content="
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;Second-chance romance&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Orthopedic surgeon Nathaniel Stallion is ready to put down his scalpel to pursue his real dream—opening a restaurant in Carmel, California. He’s even hired a top-notch marketing guru to ensure his success. But Rebecca “Bec” Marks isn’t the unassuming buddy he remembers from college. &lt;em&gt;This&lt;/em&gt; Bec is confident and wreaking all kinds of havoc on his libido. Now his best friend’s sexy curves have him thinking less about a publicity strategy and more about carnal seduction…&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Bec has had eyes for Nathaniel from day one. And regardless of Nathaniel’s naivety to her not-so-innocent schoolgirl crush, her ardor for the tempting newly crowned restaurateur remains intact. This time around she’s determined to win his heart for good. But when a rival beauty and Bec’s meddling ex-fiancé threaten her romantic plans, she’ll pull out all the stops to convince this Stallion that his soul mate has been right in front of him all along.&lt;/p&gt;
