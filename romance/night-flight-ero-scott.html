  <title>Night Flight - Ero Scott</title>
      <meta name="description" content="DESCRIPTION:&lt;br /&gt;
A mother and son, on a night flight home from Europe, discover they both have a deep and abiding love for each other. They also discover what fun can be had under complimentary blankets, as well in one of the airplane&amp;#39;s restrooms, when the interior lights of the airplane have been dimmed and nearly everyone else is asleep.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
EXCERPT:&lt;br /&gt;
Jacob was about to stretch and shift his position and go back to sleep when he felt his cock, which he now realized was more than half hard, being gently squeezed three times. He froze. He remembered waking up as the dregs of a very sexual dream dissolved. Again, through the material of his jeans he felt a warm hand squeeze his cock three times.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
My God! Jacob realized my mother is caressing my cock! Am I still dreaming, he wondered? He knew he wasn&amp;rsquo;t dreaming. Then he wondered if his mother was asleep and doing it unconsciously. He rejected that idea, too.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Jacob and his mother had accepted blankets from one of the flight attendants when the lights on the airplane were dimmed for the night flight. They were both covered up, the blankets overlapping.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Jacob&amp;rsquo;s heartbeat went up. His mother had to be caressing his cock on purpose. But why, he wondered. It would be too coincidental if she, somehow, was sexually attracted to him. With his heart in his throat, he decided to find out what was going on. He was hoping beyond hope that this wouldn&amp;rsquo;t embarrass him or his mother.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Jacob let his head droop down as though he were still asleep. He whispered above his mother&amp;rsquo;s ear, his nose buried in her fragrant hair, &amp;ldquo;Your hand feels so good, mom.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Janet gave out a little gasp of surprise and froze.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Don&amp;rsquo;t stop, mom,&amp;rdquo; Jacob said. &amp;ldquo;I like what you&amp;rsquo;re doing.&amp;rdquo; He reached under the blankets to take hold of his mother&amp;rsquo;s wrist as she was starting to pull her hand away from the fat, lazy snake in his jeans that was now about three-fourths erect." />
