  <title>The Marshal&#39;s Lady - Connie Carson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Amber had grown up as the oldest of seven children in a very poor family in St. Louis, Missouri. So, when a wealthy Texas rancher had ask her to marry him she had jumped at the chance for a better life.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;She did not know until they arrived at the ranch just how isolated the ranch was or the true personality of her husband.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Jace Prescott&#39;s father was a sheep rancher and his mother was an Apache Indian. Jace grew up under the cruel hand of his father and the hatred of the people of Wolf Creek, Texas because he was a half-breed Apache.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When his mother died his father deserted him; leaving him with nothing but the small ranch. With the help of an uncle and a lone white man he managed to grow to manhood and eventually became a marshal in El Paso county.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Amber and Seth did not meet under the best of circumstances but soon found they had a strong attraction for each other that eventually turned to love. Together they face the adversities in the still untamed American west.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Preview:&lt;br&gt;When he took off his hat to her she found herself looking up and into the eyes of the best looking man she had ever seen. She thought he looked like he might be part Indian since his hair was as black as a raven&#39;s wing and his brown eyes were so dark she could hardly see the pupils. He was well over six feet tall with broad shoulders that tapered to a narrow waist where two large handguns rode on his hips.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Looking at her closely he noticed her waist was so small he felt he could put his hands around it and his fingers would touch. Her eyes were a clear dark blue and her nose was small and turned up slightly at the end. He couldn&#39;t decide what color her hair was. It wasn&#39;t blond; it wasn&#39;t red. It reminded him of the color of honey." />
