  <title>Sex, Fashion &amp; Co. - Tracy Frances</title>
      <meta name="description" content="DESCRIPTION
Julia works as a fashion designer in her father’s fashion company. Despite her boring sexual life, she had a faithful friend and sometimes lover; he was the only one devoted friend who had a sincere crush on her. But she considered him as the brother she never had. Everything seemed to have found its normal routine, until she met Gary, with whom she had a passionate and unpredictable connection.
EXCERPT
Carried away like an engine just ignited, she placed herself so she was face front against the mirror, pressing her butt cheeks in Glen’s face. All in fever, Glen lifted up her skirt, uncovering her naked round ass, and expertly started to heat up the warm meaty white cakes of her cheeks by smacking her milky globes, till her anal hole awaked, between her shaved valley.
Julia moaned, her bare breasts sticking flat against her reflection. Aroused, she started moving her head from side to side in total abandon, as Glen pushed his fingers deeper between her cheeks, rubbing the inner walls of her dark rosebud to the base of her cunny lips. Lust was growing in Julia’s own groin.
“How can you be so teasing?” she panted, breathlessly.
“Yes, I know, and I’m going to prepare your ass.”
Julia trembled at the daring idea. Despite her moans under his digital touch. Nobody had fucked her up there. Why not try, she thought almost shyly. Her anus was feeling the need for satisfaction.
Glen lifted her butt so he began kissing and licking at her brown eye with his thick tongue, rimming in and out her back. She groaned and moaned in crescendo, aware of his vicious laps, she reached back with her hands, spreading her cheeks wide enough, in the hope of getting more pleasure. Julia realized that her eagerness was leading her to the most degrading lewdness she couldn’t imagine.
“Ooooh yes,” she moaned, as Glen’s meaty tongue moved like a worm.
Now, he parted the cleft between her butts, putting in full view the beauty of her salivated dark bud.
Slowly but surely, Glen slipped a finger, then two, into her greasy channel, dilating its muscles for better access.
Julia shivered, unsure of herself, if she was aroused by the idea of anal sex, or simply by the pleasure that it was supposed to give.
“Yesssss, now, please,” she implored him, without inhibitions.” Too excited, to be able to control herself.
 Clutching her butt, and pushing the skin apart, Glen made her anus gape, lowered his tongue between her cheeks again, and licked the stretched puckered eyelet.
“How fantastic, it is,” she ventured, “It all makes me wet and juicy.”
Glen knew she was now ready for particular attention. He smothered her sex lips, and lubricated her slack puckered lemon with her own juice until it opened by itself. At this very moment, he trailed his meaty flesh against the entrance to her anal orb, making her escape a growing sigh. He pushed himself enough to get her accustomed to his enormous size.
“MMmmmm. “Yes.” She whispered.
Like a stud, Glen started his incredible motion. Willingly, Julia parted the globes of her milky cakes wider. He pushed his flesh further in, as the gossamer walls of her anus contracted around his knob. It was then, he withdrew, spat a rope of saliva in her canal and reinserted his glans back against the starfish of her bud. Julia’s tight passage dilated even more to his assaults. She had nearly lost her breath as he rhythmically thrusted her bowels..." />
