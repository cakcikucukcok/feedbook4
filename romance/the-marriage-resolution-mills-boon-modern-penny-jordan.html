  <title>The Marriage Resolution (Mills &amp; Boon Modern) - Penny Jordan</title>
      <meta name="description" content="
        &lt;p&gt;Penny Jordan needs no introduction as arguably the most recognisable name writing for Mills &amp; Boon. We have celebrated her wonderful writing with a special collection, many of which for the first time in eBook format and all available right now.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Her husband-to-be? Dee had thought a career was enough to keep her happy and fulfilled. But now she regrets giving up her chance of marriage, babies and family life… Especially when Hugo Montpelier, the man she once passionately loved, returns.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Their sexual hunger for one another is as strong as ever. Maybe marriage and motherhood can still be hers – but first she must dare to reveal the scandal she has kept secret for so long…&lt;/p&gt;
