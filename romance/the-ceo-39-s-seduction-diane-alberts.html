  <title>The CEO&#39;s Seduction - Diane Alberts</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The last thing Brett Ross wants is to be back in the same old damn small town he grew up in, but his best friend is getting married, so there&#39;s no way he&#39;s skipping yet another visit home. He knows the trip won&#39;t be easy, but the one thing he didn&#39;t count on is how grown up little Anna Hamilton is...or the way she makes him feel when he sets eyes on her.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Anna&#39;s been in love with Brett for years, even if she&#39;s always been his best friend&#39;s annoying little sister to him. But when he looks at her now, she doesn&#39;t see annoyance in his eyes. If anything, she sees a silent calling for her to save him from himself...and she&#39;s just the girl to do it. All she needs is to find a way to escape her pesky, protective older brothers. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And then the game is &lt;i&gt;on&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Each book in the Hamilton Family series is STANDALONE.&lt;br&gt;* The CEO&#39;s Seduction&lt;br&gt;* Romancing the Bachelor&lt;br&gt;* Catching the Player&lt;/p&gt;" />
