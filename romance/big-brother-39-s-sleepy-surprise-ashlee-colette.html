  <title>Big Brother&#39;s Sleepy Surprise - Ashlee Colette</title>
      <meta name="description" content="DESCRIPTION:&lt;br /&gt;
A few short months ago, Chris met his half-sister for the very first time. The moment he laid eyes on her, he knew he had to have her. Lily is the picture of innocence, at least on the outside. When Chris learns about Lily&amp;rsquo;s twisted relationship with their father, will it diminish his attraction to her? Or will Lily&amp;rsquo;s naughty behavior give Chris the push he needs to take their relationship to an intimate new level...with or without her knowledge?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
EXCERPT:&lt;br /&gt;
That first night was absolute torture for Chris. He had to pretend to engage in conversation with his new-found dad all while his gorgeous, Barbie-doll looking sister was sitting so close to him that their elbows touched every time she dug into her food. It was a nightmare. It was also the best thing that ever happened to him. That is, until about a week later when his brand new daddy asked Chris if he wanted to move in with them.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Chris had his own place. It was a shit-hole, but it was the first apartment he&amp;rsquo;d ever rented on his own and he was proud of that. Still, the temptation was too great. He jumped at the chance to live under the same roof as his new sister. He wasn&amp;rsquo;t disappointed with his choice.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Lily had the habit of walking around the house in tank tops that showed off her huge tits and tiny shorts that barely covered her perfect ass. He spent the next few days staring at her in ways a brother should never look at his sister. He stared so long, he memorized the shape of her curves and could count every birth mark on her pale skin.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
About a week after he moved in with his new family, he made a shocking discovery. He&amp;rsquo;d told Stuart that he wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be home that night because he was staying over at his girlfriend&amp;rsquo;s place. That was the plan until he and his girl got into a huge fucking argument and she told him that she wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be riding his dick that night. With the promise of sex off the table, he had no reason to spend the night at her place, so after getting hammered at the local bar, he went home.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
He was just drunk enough to try the thing he&amp;rsquo;d been wanting to do for weeks: sneak into his sister&amp;rsquo;s bedroom. He wasn&amp;rsquo;t planning on fucking her that night. For one thing, Stuart was home. For another, he was smashed and wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be capable of giving her his best performance. No, he was only going to look at her. Maybe cop a feel if she was asleep, but nothing more. Yet when he slipped into his sister&amp;rsquo;s room, he found her bed empty.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
He knew she was home because her purse and her keys were downstairs. He hadn&amp;rsquo;t known her long, but he damn well knew she never went anywhere without that shit. He also knew Stuart was home because his work boots were by the door and a glass had been left on the table. Lily was too much of a neat-freak to leave a glass lying around so it had to be their dad&amp;rsquo;s doing.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Chris went back downstairs and checked to see if he&amp;rsquo;d somehow missed Lily when he came home. He hadn&amp;rsquo;t. He also checked the upstairs bathroom and even his own room in case she was in there for some reason. She wasn&amp;rsquo;t. That only left one room. Stuart&amp;rsquo;s. Chris could only think of a single reason why his sister and father would be in a bedroom together." />
