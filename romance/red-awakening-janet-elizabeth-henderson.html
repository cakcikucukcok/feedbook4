For an ex-army ranger, even one out of his element by a century, it should be a walk in the park.

Mace Armstrong is another army ranger sent to CommTECH to recruit/kidnap its Press Secretary, Keiko Sato; sparks fly from their first touch.<br /><b><i>Red Awakening (Red Zone, #2) by Janet Elizabeth Henderson</i></b> | Janet Elizabeth Henderson has followed up Red Zone with another winner! I absolutely devoured this book in one sitting. It was an amazingly fun emotional roller coaster that made me laugh out loud, feel the pain of betrayal, become indignant, snort at the witty sarcasm, cheer for the bad-ass good guys, thoroughly hate the vicious bad guys, and cry in sympathy for the losses incurred.<br /><p><h3 align="left">Download Ebook|PDF|Epub of <a href=>Red Awakening - Janet Elizabeth Henderson</a> </h3></p><hr/>
