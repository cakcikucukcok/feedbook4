  <title>It&#39;s Hotter In Hawaii - HelenKay Dimon</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;b&gt;Aloha, Gorgeous.  .  . &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  Cassie Montgomery was in no mood for messing around--until she got an eyeful of the sizzling-hot miscreant breaking into her half-brother Dan&#39;s Hawaii home. Turns out he&#39;s not a criminal, but a friend who&#39;s just as suspicious of Dan&#39;s &quot;accidental&quot; death as she is. Cassie&#39;s beyond tired of bashing heads with thick-skulled local law enforcement, so there&#39;s only one thing for it: team up with Caleb Wilson, and try to keep her secrets--and hands--to herself.  .  .  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  Having a gun trained on him is nothing new for Cal. But when said gun is brandished by a goddess sporting short-shorts, a bad attitude, and a hidden agenda? A man should consider his choices very carefully. Option one: Seduce first, ask questions later. Option two: Find out why she&#39;s in his Air Force buddy&#39;s torn-up house, then seduce her. Option three: Let the islands do their work and let the woman behind the weapon seduce him.  .  ." />
