  <title>An Accidental Date with a Billionaire - Diane Alberts</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Samantha Matthews turned her back on her wealthy family to focus on social work. Those who know her think she&#39;s the heart of kindness. Those who know her really well know she&#39;s in a never-ending battle to make up for the harm her family&#39;s companies inflict on the world. Which is how she finds herself at a charity bachelor auction of all places.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But oops, she was supposed to bid on her bff&#39;s brother as a favor and accidentally bid on the wrong guy. Sue her for not being able to tell one stick-in-the-mud CEO from another.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Backstage, she goes to tell him not to worry about having to go through with a date or anything, but the oafish billionaire cuts her off dismissively. Looks her up and down, hands her a card with his assistant&#39;s contact details, and reminds her that sex is definitely off the table. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Oh, she&#39;ll call the assistant all right and have her make sure he wears jeans and comfortable shoes and to pick her up at seven a.m. The only &quot;hammering&quot; this guy is going to be doing is at Habitat for Humanity.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Too bad he turns out to be nothing like she expected.&lt;/p&gt;" />
