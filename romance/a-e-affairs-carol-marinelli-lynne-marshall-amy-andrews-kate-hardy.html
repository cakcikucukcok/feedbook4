  <title>A&amp;E Affairs - Carol Marinelli, Lynne Marshall, Amy Andrews, Kate Hardy...</title>

        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt; Six exciting A&amp;E affairs from some of M&amp;B’s best-loved authors!&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;HER LITTLE SECRET by Carol Marinelli&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;New doctor Nick Roberts is all too aware of his charms…but his fun-loving attitude is so infectious that his patients – and nurse Alison Carter – are unwillingly hooked. One night with Nick leaves Alison with a new zest for life – and one rather more unexpected gift…&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;TEMPORARY DOCTOR, SURPRISE FATHER by Lynne Marshall&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Of all the ERs in the world, he had to walk into hers… Jan can’t believe one-time bad boy Dr Beck Braxton is back in her life. While he’s changed, the chemistry between them is still very much alight. Now Jan must tell him her secret…that Beck is the father of her child!&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;JUST ONE LAST NIGHT… by Amy Andrews&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Juggling life as a stand-in-mum, Grace is already under fire before meeting new boss Brent Cartwright, the ex who has always held her heart. As impossible as he was to forget, Brent is now even harder to resist!&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;ITALIAN DOCTOR, NO STRINGS ATTACHED by Kate Hardy&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;The attraction between A&amp;E doctors Marco Ranieri and Sydney Collins led to a whirlwind affair, sweeping from London to sun-drenched Italy. It was supposed to be strictly no-strings-attached– until one tiny unexpected consequence changes all the rules!&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;PROPOSING TO THE CHILDREN’S DOCTOR by Joanna Neil&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Children’s doctor Rebecca McIntyre finds it rather disconcerting when everything falls apart as soon as Dr Craig Braemer arrives on the scene. But when Craig offers her a position in the A&amp;E and a place to stay, Rebecca realises that she quite likes having it all kissed better…&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;THE NURSE’S BROODING BOSS by Laura Idling&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Dr Brock Madison can’t believe Elana Shultz works in his new A&amp;E department! She’s a daily reminder of his troubled past, but her beauty soon melts away his reserve. Brock wants to spend the rest of his life with this nurse in a million…but will Elana let him in?&lt;/p&gt;
