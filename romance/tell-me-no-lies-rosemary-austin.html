  <title>Tell Me No Lies - Rosemary Austin</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Tell Me No Lies
by Rosemary Austin
It is the mid-1980s. Shelley Morgan, a slim, blonde, technical editor in Orlando, works for a leading computer magazine. When Shelley&#39;s mother gives her husband&#39;s family heirloom, a museum quality antique necklace, as security for a gambling debt, she has second thoughts. Her mother begs Shelley to get the necklace back. This starts Shelley on a trail that takes her from Orlando to Miami to Key West and, eventually, to a wild chase through Florida. 
Shelly, trying to be a loving and dutiful daughter, contacts handsome lawyer Dirk Gentile for help, but he seems determined to thwart her at every turn. The first time they meet to talk, they are shouting at each other within a very short time. The chagrined and frustrated Shelley decides to get the necklace back, herself.  Apprehended as she puts her plan into action, she is suspected of Breaking and Entering, a felony. During the confrontation with the police, Dirk helps get the charge reduced to trespassing, a misdemeanor, and Shelley is placed in his custody until the facts and her ID are checked out." />
