        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Tessa O&#39;Neal has taken on her sexy old flame, Mitch Ryder, as a client. That means she has to spend the next seven days in this man&#39;s constant company and not fall into his bed. No problem. They may have once set the sheets on fire but she can definitely resist him.

So before the week is up, he&#39;s going to use every sensual secret he knows to seduce her back into his arms. But their hot embraces are more powerful than ever and now they&#39;ll have to decide if they&#39;re daring enough to extend their week.…&lt;/p&gt;
