  <title>Letters from Cyberspace - Christine Jacobsen, George Pappas</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;&lt;B&gt;NEW IN TOWN &amp; SEEKING ADVENTURE: I am a tall 510 MWF 23 curvy (36 D) brunette with blue eyes. I am new to this and I am not sexually experienced. I want to find someone to take me to new heights of sexual adventure. I would love to please a man who knows how to make me scream with orgasmic delight. Could this be you? No freaks, no phonies and no selfish lovers. Serious replies only. No games. I am looking forward to our sexual fun. Please e-mail if interested.&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;I&gt;Christine shivered with nervous excitement. Posting such an ad was unthinkable in Provo. But she wasnt in Utah anymore. She was in Los Angeles and far away from her parents influence and strict Mormon upbringing...&lt;/I&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;So begins the erotic journey of Christine Jacobsen, the 23-year-old protagonist of a new fiction novel &lt;i&gt;Letters From Cyberspace&lt;/i&gt; based on the email of real people. Stuck in a bad marriage, she uses her computer to create an adventurous alter ego named Noelle and explores her hidden sexuality, meeting a number of single and married men for hotel trysts. She later meets the love of her life, an actor from Beverly Hills named Robert." />
