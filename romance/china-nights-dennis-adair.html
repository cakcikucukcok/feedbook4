  <title>China Nights - Dennis Adair</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Surgical nurse, Katie OFarrell enters a strange, exotic world when she follows the man she loves to China. She is shocked and disillusioned when she discovers he is married. Unable to face her family at home, she decides to remain in China and work with a missionary group. When the Japanese invade China, Katie faces undreamed-of dangers. In Nanking she takes on the task of leading a group of Chinese orphans to safety. On this journey she is reunited with Jim Austin. He is a Flying Tiger who has been shot down and is masquerading as a priest. On their perilous journey to safety, love comes again to Katie.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eventually Katie is forced to go to Hong Kong with her adopted daughter. When the Japanese invade the British Colony in 1941, they are sent to a Japanese camp. Katie and her daughter escape the camp to cross China alone. The character of Katie OFarrell is based on a composite of two nurses who did in reality escape Stanley Camp and walk to freedom in Burma. Real characters and historic incidents pepper this exciting World War II story.&lt;/p&gt;" />
