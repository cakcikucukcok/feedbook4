  <title>Hidden Beach - R. Richard</title>
      <meta name="description" content="DESCRIPTION:&lt;br /&gt;
Jim grows up on Ocean Lane and becomes the king of Hidden Beach. However, most of the people who live on Ocean Lane work for the government at nearby facilities. Suddenly, Reductions In Force threaten to destroy life on Ocean Lane. One by one, the people around Jim fall, as his world is destroyed. Jim must find a way to survive.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
EXCERPT:&lt;br /&gt;
What we Ocean Lane kids mainly did was to walk down to Hidden Beach and hang out.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Hidden Beach was a little beach, at the end of a stub street.&amp;nbsp; The only access to Hidden Beach was a steep climb, down a dirt path.&amp;nbsp; However, once you got to Hidden Beach, it was kind of nice.&amp;nbsp; There was a little patch of golden sand, hidden from the cares of the world.&amp;nbsp; Lucy and I would walk over to Hidden Beach and then climb down the path.&amp;nbsp; If there were other kids there, we would say hello and spread out a beach towel.&amp;nbsp; At the East end of Hidden Beach, there was a spot, where the 18-year-old kids would place some sort of sign and then swim over to another little beach, to the East.&amp;nbsp; The little beach to the East was accessible only from the water and was sort of under a rock face and not visible from above.&amp;nbsp; The kids would swim over to the little beach and then swim back, removing the sign that they left, when they started their adventure.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Early on, I got a part time job at one of the government installations and I would work a couple of hours, after school, work study thing.&amp;nbsp; During the summer, I would work full time, also work study.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Lucy and I would usually just use Hidden Beach, on the week ends.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I wanted to take the swim, over to the adventure beach, but Lucy didn&amp;rsquo;t.&amp;nbsp; What the hell, we were both just 17-years-old.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The kids who did take the adventure swim were the 18-year-olds.&amp;nbsp; They were either going to go off to college or they were going to go to work at one of the government installations.&amp;nbsp; The kids who were going to work at a government installation were suddenly faced with a demand to either get married or give up the adventure swims.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
As time went on, I saved my money and was preparing to go off to to college.&amp;nbsp; As my high school graduation approached, I had to take what seemed like an endless number of tests.&amp;nbsp; Often, I would have to take tests on a Saturday.&amp;nbsp; I did very well on the tests and even won a few college scholarships, due to my test scores.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
However, the tests meant that I couldn&amp;rsquo;t go to Hidden Beach, nearly as much.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Lucy became very unhappy with the situation.&amp;nbsp; In fact Lucy became so unhappy with the situation that she started to hang with Warren the wimp.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I wasn&amp;rsquo;t too unhappy with Lucy hanging with Warren, since Linda moved in on me.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Linda was the kind of girl who wore bathing suits with absolute minimum coverage.&amp;nbsp; Linda had to be very careful, when lying down on her beach towel, or she would fall out of the top of her bikini.&amp;nbsp; Linda was also shaved, &amp;lsquo;down there,&amp;rsquo; since any hair at all would have showed.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Since Linda and I had each just turned 18-years-old, I obtained a plastic dish pan and an empty bottle of McIlhenny&amp;rsquo;s Tabasco Sauce.&amp;nbsp; I would put Linda&amp;rsquo;s beach towel, my two beach towels and the empty bottle of McIlhenny&amp;rsquo;s Tabasco Sauce in my plastic dish pan.&amp;nbsp; Linda and I then walk down to Hidden Beach, via the dirt path in." />
