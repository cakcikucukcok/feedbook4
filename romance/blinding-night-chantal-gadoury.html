  <title>Blinding Night - Chantal Gadoury</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;What if you were the missing piece in one of the world&amp;rsquo;s most epic legends?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Despite being an art history student, Summer isn&amp;rsquo;t thrilled to be stuck with her archeologist family all summer in Greece. While the rest of her college friends are posting a million selfies by the pool together, Summer is stuck alone, trying to entertain herself alone in a place where she doesn&amp;rsquo;t even speak the language.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Upon her arrival to Greece, strange dreams and even stranger shadows seem to haunt Summer, leaving her to ponder the meaning of pomegranate seeds and twisted, darkened faces.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Suddenly, her stay abroad leads to tragic twists, leaving Summer in the arms of a dark stranger, who claims to be the god, Hades, whom she feels like she knows from another life. In a whirlwind through the busy streets of Athens, Summer is seduced to the lowest point of Greece where Hades&amp;rsquo; lair awaits&amp;hellip;the Underworld. Determined to find out who she is and where she belongs in an age-old myth, Summer joins Hades to discover that the secrets about her past life are beyond anything she could have ever imagined." />
