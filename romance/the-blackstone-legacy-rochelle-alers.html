  <title>The Blackstone Legacy - Rochelle Alers</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Long Hot Summer&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Veterinarian Ryan Blackstone has a chip on his shoulder that keeps him firmly unattached. He&amp;#39;s got a young son he adores, a legacy and a family to be proud of. He&amp;#39;s not looking for anything else. And the last thing on Kelly Andrews&amp;#39;s mind is romance when she accepts a job at the famous Blackstone stud farm. But when she meets sexy Ryan, she begins to question her resolve to remain faithful to her deceased husband&amp;#39;s memory. Soon tensions and passions create a heat wave of unspoken need and maybe a chance for new beginnings&amp;#133;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;Very Private Duty&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;At one time, nothing was able to quench Jeremy Blackstone&amp;#39;s insatiable hunger for luscious Tricia Parker. Even though they were from different worlds, he lived for their passion&amp;#150;filled encounters. Then ugly accusations of her betrayal ripped them apart&amp;#133;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Years later Tricia has come home to help her grandfather, not to rekindle her affair with the man who broke her heart. But when federal agent Jeremy is injured and needs her nursing skills, staying by his bedside rekindles a sensuous yearning that Tricia cannot control. The magnetic closeness they once shared ignites an irresistible attraction that pulls them together once again&amp;#133;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;" />
