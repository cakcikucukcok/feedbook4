  <title>Hooked on Trouble - Kelly Siskind</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Reality bites. Hard.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  The last time Raven did &quot;real&quot; was sixteen months ago, when she spent one unforgettable night with the tattooed, impossibly sexy Nico, and then he disappeared the next day. Since then, she&#39;s kept her guard up and her feelings to herself. She doesn&#39;t have time for relationship drama when she&#39;s busy searching for her long lost sister.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  Nico hasn&#39;t stopped thinking about Raven---her sultry curves, inked skin, or the fact that he ditched her after their night together. Now that they&#39;re living in the same city, he knows this is his chance to make things right. What better way to prove to Raven he&#39;s for real than helping her find her sister? But when the lines between right and wrong start to blur, putting his job on the line, Nico has to decide if the risk is worth the ultimate reward.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  Praise for Kelly Siskind&#39;s novels:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  &quot;You will be hooked from the first page.&quot;-Kelly Elliott, &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author on &lt;i&gt;A Fine Mess&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;  &quot;Everything that I&#39;ve come to expect from a Kelly Siskind novel---characters that make me smile, laugh, and swoon.&quot; -- Jennifer Blackwood, &lt;i&gt;USA Today&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author on &lt;i&gt;A Fine Mess&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;  &quot;Crackles with wit and heat!&quot;-M.
