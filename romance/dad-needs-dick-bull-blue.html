  <title>Dad Needs Dick - Bull Blue</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;b&gt;DESCRIPTION:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
It is quite simple really: Rob and his father Colt need to let off some steam before their Halloween party within their eleven year relationship.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;EXCERPT:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
As I later learned, Dad wasn&amp;rsquo;t so much ashamed of being gay as he was reconciling the polar face-off that was his life. There were discernable shards of guilt he carried from his natural machismo that directly went against his constant need of tooting up his rear in need of a thorough plough. In short, my father is a whorish bottom.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Fortunately, I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t have come to learn any of this if it wasn&amp;rsquo;t for me slipping up. Dad caught me one night after work with a face full of divine ass getting ready to give his little stepbrother the ride of his life for his twenty-second birthday. Dad saw everything, from the first vigorous pump to the last without opening his mouth. My cock had just spit its first batch of icing onto those cakes, slowly coming back to my senses when I looked over and saw the horror on my dad&amp;rsquo;s face. If it is true orgasm is another word for little death, then I experienced a few of them in that moment looking over at Dad. Even with ribbons still shooting from my cock, he marched towards with muffled words erupting from his throat as my life flashed before my eyes. I came back to a little with Dad&amp;rsquo;s younger stepbrother rounding up his clothes and fleeing in embarrassment, apologizing. I came to even more with Dad bawling, begging me to give girls a chance. That life would be easier on me going down the straight and narrow rather than getting my needs met in dark holes. More than anything I wanted to stop the tears streaming down his face. I started shouting, but I ended up grabbing his face and kissing him. Strangely, he kissed back.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
We went back and forth, stop and started, before my hand slipped to feel his exposed cock. In hindsight, it was always exposed; slick from the leakage it stirred watching me fuck another guy. We got lost in our passion, forgetting our other bond. Soon, I had his clothes off, his slightly haired torso over the side of the bed. And with the help of some lube, I pushed in, urging him to push out without need. And in a deep quivering sigh, with me deep in his channel, I sated the very need he&amp;rsquo;d been searching for his entire life." />
