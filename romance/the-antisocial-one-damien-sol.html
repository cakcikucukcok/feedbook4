  <title>The Antisocial One - Damien Sol</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;b&gt;DESCRIPTION:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
For eighteen years Tate Miller had to deal with a mother that truly cared nothing about him. Little did he know of how his half-sisters felt about him. Forced to join them at their church summer camp, where Becky and Cindy slowly showed their brother that they were the only ones he needed. Yet is Tate truly free from his overbearing mother?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;EXCERPT:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;I can take care of that for you, that is if you want me to like we did at the lake,&amp;rdquo; Cindy said as her hand slowing inched closer to her brother&amp;rsquo;s groin.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Sure, knock yourself out,&amp;rdquo; Tate said not really understanding what his sister was asking.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
A devious smile graced her face as a wicked thought darted across her mind. She knew Tate was nearly back to sleep otherwise she doubted he would have agreed. Yet Cindy wasn&amp;rsquo;t content with just giving Tate a hand job, no, she wanted to know how her brother&amp;rsquo;s cock tasted like. It was going to happen sooner or later. Why not now? The sleeping bag slid down her back as she straddled her brother&amp;rsquo;s body. Ever so slowly Cindy gently pushed down Tate&amp;rsquo;s underwear. She didn&amp;rsquo;t want Tate to awaken at least not yet. Knowing how he had avoided them for the past three days. It was her hope that he wouldn&amp;rsquo;t wake up just to leave her longing for his presence all over again, and this time she doubted Tate would simply ignore them.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Her breath was caught in her chest as the lightning highlighted Tate&amp;rsquo;s cock. Her mouth watered as she became hypnotized by its pulsations. Her heart raced, her nerves were on edge at the sight of the very first cock she was going to suck. Licking her lips as she drew closer to it. Listening to her brother&amp;rsquo;s slight movements as her breath flowed over that hot appendage. Her eyes glanced up to ensure that Tate hadn&amp;rsquo;t awoken. Watching for any sign that he was playing possum as she flicked out her tongue.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;You got this Cindy,&amp;rdquo; she said to herself before her lips touched that bulbous crown. Her hands were planted on either side of Tate&amp;rsquo;s hips as she sank down on her brother&amp;rsquo;s cock. Her eyes fluttered as she held it firmly within her mouth. Slowly she started to rock her neck mimicking all those porn actresses she had watched to prepare herself for this moment. Adding her hand into the mix feeling her saliva coating her hand as she increased her pace, although not so much to wake her brother. Savoring the taste of Tate&amp;rsquo;s cock as the minutes ticked by, yet she yearned to feel his cum exploding across her tongue. To have that hot seed filling her mouth to the brim. Arching an eyebrow as she felt the sudden swelling of his cock as her tongue teased it. Her eyes flew wide as felt something striking the back of her throat. Quickly easing back so she wouldn&amp;rsquo;t waste this chance of his cum going straight down her throat. Squeezing her eyes tightly as she tilted her head back at the odd taste of it. It was one thing to have a small taste, however, this was a huge load that was sitting on her tongue. In three swallows her brother&amp;rsquo;s cum sat within her stomach. Rolling her tongue at the aftertaste it left as she peered down at her brother&amp;rsquo;s sleeping body. A loving smile spread across her lips as she listening to his steady breathing. Hoping for the time when she could properly show him just what she looked like with his root firmly planted in her mouth." />
