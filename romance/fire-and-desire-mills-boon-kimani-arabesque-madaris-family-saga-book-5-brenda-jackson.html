  <title>Fire And Desire (Mills &amp; Boon Kimani Arabesque) (Madaris Family Saga, Book 5) - Brenda Jackson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="
        &lt;p&gt;Two years ago, geologist Corinthians Avery had brazenly sneaked into a hotel room to seduce Dex Madaris, head of Madaris Explorations and the longtime object of her affection. But the man who emerged from the shower to find Corinthians clad in next to nothing was handsome foreman Trevor Grant.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;When a smug Trevor informed her that Dex was not only absent from the trip, but at home happily married, Corinthians was mortified.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Now, stuck in South America on a business trip with Trevor, Corinthians tries to avoid him at all costs. If only his broad shoulders and wickedly sexy smile didn&#39;t send her senses into flames. Their hotel falls under terrorist attack, and Corinthians has no choice but to place her trust in Trevor. As the two make a daring escape into the war-torn streets, fear for their lives suddenly turns to feverish desire, as they both give in to the hottest danger of all. What neither of them realizes is that one sultry night of passion under the luminous Latin skies will change their lives forever….&lt;/p&gt;
