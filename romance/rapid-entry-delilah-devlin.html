      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Firefighter Gage Eastwood doesn&#39;t hesitate to race into his neighbor&#39;s apartment to put out the fire there. Of course, some hesitation might have given him the time to realize he was buck naked. He&#39;s a professional, so he can overlook the fact she&#39;s in her underwear, but after a nosy neighbor snaps some pictures of them, the fire and his naked heroics go viral.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shy Viviana Moore is a bestselling romance author. She might write about kink, she&#39;s never done anything kinky. So when her hotter-than-hot savior invites her out to his sex club, La Forge, she doesn&#39;t admit at first to her lack of actual kinky experience. Soon, she has more than enough material for a whole new series as well as some hands-on experience of her own, and Gage is wondering if she&#39;d let him be her muse...permanently.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each novella in the Delta Fire series is a standalone story that can be enjoyed in any order.&lt;br&gt;Series order:&lt;br&gt;Book 1: Burning Up Memphis&lt;br&gt;Book 2: Hotter with a Pole&lt;br&gt;Book 3: Rapid Entry&lt;/p&gt;" />
