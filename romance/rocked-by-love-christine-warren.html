What she doesn&#39;t know is that she&#39;s being watched over by a powerful protector. &lt;br&gt;She is watched by a legend in stone who has defended humanity throughout the ages. A rock-hard savior who swoops down from the sky, scoops Kylie into his impossibly strong arms, and draws her into a world that no mortal woman can imagine...or resist.&lt;br&gt;As the strongest of the gargoyles, Dag is sworn to destroy the demons that threaten Kylie&#39;s world before returning to his stony slumber. But the burning desire she ignites in him is even harder to fight--an all-consuming force that, once unleashed, can never be tamed. When the ultimate battle begins, Dag and Kylie must face some demons of their own--to carve out a love that&#39;s stronger than time...&lt;br&gt;Soars with fun, witty characters and nonstop action.&quot; ?Publishers Weekly on Stone Cold Lover&lt;br&gt;Don&#39;t miss the other books in the Gargoyle series:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Book #1: Heart of Stone&lt;br&gt; Book #2: Stone Cold Lover&lt;br&gt; Book #3: Hard as a Rock&lt;br&gt;Book #5: Hard to Handle&lt;/p&gt;" />
