  <title>The Platinum Collection: An Australian Conquest: The Incorrigible Playboy / His Most Exquisite Conquest / His Bought Mistress (The Australians, Book 21) (Mills &amp; Boon M&amp;B) - Emma Darcy</title>
      <meta name="description" content="
        &lt;h2&gt;Do they deserve what they want?&lt;/h2&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Billionaire Harry Finn’s reputation is legendary: formidable in business, charming to beautiful women. What he wants, he gets – and top of his list is secretary Elizabeth. One month working on the luxurious Finn Island resort is surely enough time for Harry to sweep this office beauty from behind her desk and into his bed?&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;In the boardroom men quail at Michael Finn’s business prowess and in the bedroom women beg for his touch. Nothing eludes the Australian tycoon’s grasp – except for Lucy Flippence. Vivacious Lucy doesn’t fit in Michael’s corporate world, but can she resist the attraction sizzling between them?&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;The instant Australian billionaire Hugo sees Angie he knows he has to have her. When she agrees to join him on a weekend trip to Tokyo, Angie doesn&#39;t realise that he&#39;s a man used to paying for what he wants and that she&#39;s been bought – for his pleasure!&lt;/p&gt;
