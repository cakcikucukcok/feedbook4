          &lt;em&gt;&quot;I want the boy.&quot;&lt;/em&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;For three years Angie Montoya hid her son from her late fiancé&#39;s family…until his brother tracked them down. Now Jordan Cooper demands she move to his Santa Fe ranch–the boy&#39;s birthright. But how can Angie live with the man who called her a gold digger…the man whose one kiss she&#39;s never forgotten?&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Racked by guilt since his twin&#39;s death, Jordan seeks redemption by raising his nephew. But Angie resurrects a hunger in him that only she can satisfy. Jordan knows he can have her on one condition–that she never learns the truth about him.&lt;/p&gt;
