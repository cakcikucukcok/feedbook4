  <title>Selfish Acts - Kimberly A. Henderson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="When Childhood relationships are carried on into adulthood, sometimes its hard to remember why you were friends in the first place.  Especially when there are secrets that not everyone knows about each other.  Daniel considers himself a true friend to all, but he senses that there are times when Stacy is more receptive to Big Anthony.  Even though they have all known each other since they were in grade school, Big Anthony and Stacy always have that certain connection that no one else can figure out.  And with everything else going on in Daniels life with his on-again/off-again girlfriend Melissa, he feels like his opportunities for happiness are progressing slower than normal.
Stacy has never been a true believer in a lifetime of happiness.  Her views and ideals on relationships stem from an abusive home environment that she just cannot let go of.  Men are disposable and love never means what people want it to mean.  The only steady relationships she has had are her close nit group of friends.  But only one of them truly knows all of the demons that haunt her.  Big Anthony has been her closest confidant since high school, the only one she trusts with all of her past.  But when she, Big Anthony and the rest of their friends are confronted with a devastating loss, and unforeseen circumstances, it takes all of Stacys courage, will and faith to see how much they all can overcome and move on from the past to the future." />
