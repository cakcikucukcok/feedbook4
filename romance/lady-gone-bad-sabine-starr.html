  <title>Lady Gone Bad - Sabine Starr</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;b&gt;A Woman&#39;s Secrets&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The saloon singer known as Lady Gone Bad is the most drop-dead gorgeous outlaw the West has ever seen. Lady has never met a cowboy she couldn&#39;t entice, or a lawman she couldn&#39;t outrun. But when Lady tangles with a sexy U.S. Marshall, she&#39;s tempted to stick around long enough to watch him lay down the law--in her bed. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;A Man&#39;s Desires&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;U. S. Marshall Rafe Morgan wants to lock up Lady Gone Bad for good--and he won&#39;t let his attraction to her slow him down. But when his attempt to bring Lady to justice goes awry, Rafe is nearly hanged--and by dawn, his face is plastered next to hers on every &quot;Wanted&quot; poster in Texas. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;A Passion Unleashed&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Now on the run together, Rafe and Lady find themselves in very close quarters--and even more compromising positions. As Lady surrenders to Rafe&#39;s touch, she slowly begins to reveal all her secrets--including her real name. Maybe Lady Gone Bad isn&#39;t beyond redemption after all. Either way, Rafe is in for one wild ride.  .  .&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&quot;An exciting read!&quot; --&lt;i&gt;New York Times &lt;/i&gt; bestselling author Bobbi Smith" />
