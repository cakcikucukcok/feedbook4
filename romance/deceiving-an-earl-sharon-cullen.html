Her parents had already planned out her life - she was never to become Oliver&#39;s wife, despite their plans to run away. To protect her secret, she had to follow their wishes and marry the elderly earl they had chosen. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Now Ellen&#39;s world is threatened by a blackmailer who could expose everything.
