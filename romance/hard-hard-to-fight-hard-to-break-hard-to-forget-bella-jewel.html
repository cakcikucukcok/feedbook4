  <title>Hard: Hard to Fight, Hard to Break, Hard to Forget - Bella Jewel</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;USA Today&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author Bella Jewel has captivated readers with her sizzling hot tales. Here together for the first time in a convenient ebook bundle is the full Alpha Hearts series:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Hard to Fight&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Grace is a bounty hunter who wants to be taken seriously, but her boss refuses to believe that a woman can bring down a dangerous criminal. She finally gets a chance to prove herself when she&#39;s given the case of a lifetime: capture Raide Knox and bring him to justice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Raide is a dangerous fugitive on the run...and the sexiest man Grace has ever met. Catching Raide won&#39;t be easy. He&#39;s not the kind of man to go down without a fight. Raide is more intense and frustrating than any man she&#39;s ever had to deal with, and the instantaneous attraction that sparks between them is undeniable. One thing is for sure...it&#39;s going to be a case they will never forget.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Hard to Break&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Quinn has spent her whole life working in her dad&#39;s garage, leaving her more comfortable with a carburetor than a curling iron. Her world is turned upside down when her beloved garage is bought by none other than world famous, sexy as sin, custom car builder, Tazen Watts. He&#39;s the one man she can&#39;t stand...even though he makes her hotter than a high performance engine in top gear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tazen has no use for Quinn, at least not professionally, and he&#39;s making sure she knows it. But there&#39;s a spark between them that she&#39;s finding hard to ignore. She&#39;s determined to prove her talent is as impressive as her sassy mouth. When she finds out Tazen is hiding a secret that could bring down his career and everyone involved in it, she wonders: is falling for him is going to be worth the risk?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Hard to Forget&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Delaney is a professional bodyguard who&#39;s spent years trying to prove herself in a male dominated industry. Now she&#39;s facing her greatest challenge yet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bad boy billionaire Jax Shields has made plenty of enemies on his climb to the top, and now his life is at risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When he hires a bodyguard, he never expected to put his life in the hands of a petite woman with a big attitude. Jax demands the best in everything, and he doesn&#39;t think Delaney has what it takes to protect him. He&#39;d rather have her on her back than covering his.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Will Delaney be able to prove herself to the most arrogant--and devastatingly handsome--man she&#39;s ever met?&lt;/p&gt;" />
