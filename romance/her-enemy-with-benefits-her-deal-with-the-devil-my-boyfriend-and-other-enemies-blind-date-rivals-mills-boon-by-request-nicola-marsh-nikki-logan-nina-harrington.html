  <title>Her Enemy With Benefits: Her Deal with the Devil / My Boyfriend and Other Enemies / Blind Date Rivals (Mills &amp; Boon By Request) - Nicola Marsh, Nikki Logan, Nina Harrington</title>

          &lt;strong&gt;Her Deal With the Devil&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Patrick Fourde was once famed for the trail of broken hearts and rumpled bed-sheets he left behind him. Now the fashion-house CEO is determined to make his name known for the right reasons. First challenge? Getting Sapphire Seaborn, Melbourne’s Queen of Jewellery, on side.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Sapphie sacrificed everything for her jewellery business and very nearly lost it all. She hates that to rescue it, she needs to work alongside her nemesis Patrick!&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;It was supposed to be business-only, but Sapphie quickly realises that when you make a deal with a devil this scorching, someone’s going to get burnt…&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;My Boyfriend and Other Enemies&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;The moment Tash Sinclair sets eyes on family rival Aiden Moore, she knows she’s in trouble. His vendetta against her is bad enough, but the fact she finds Aiden outrageously attractive makes everything a million times worse!&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Tash and Aiden clash immediately, but everyone knows that the line between love and hate is paper thin. As the fireworks fly, will Tash and Aiden spontaneously combust, or will Tash do the unthinkable, and fall for her own worst enemy? After all, you should keep your friends close, but maybe your enemies the closest of all…!&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;Blind Date Rivals&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Sara should be preparing for a meeting to secure her business. Instead she’s being stood up by a man she’s never even met! Things improve when gorgeous city-boy Leo asks her to dance – until he reveals his relief that his ‘country bumpkin’ blind date didn’t show…&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Sara could almost ignore the words slipping from his oh-so-kissable mouth – if the next ones weren’t that he’s planning to build on the land she wants to buy! Turning to ice, yet very aware of his warm, strong arms around her waist, Sara’s suddenly reminded of a saying: keep your enemies closer…&lt;/p&gt;
