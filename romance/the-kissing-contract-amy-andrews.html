  <title>The Kissing Contract - Amy Andrews</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Marshall Dyson wants one thing and one thing only: to raze his grandfather&#39;s island to the ground. Everything is ready to go--except for the freakin&#39; bunnies! Hundreds of the furry critters hopping about and multiplying before his eyes. And then there&#39;s the American Bunny League, along with one distractingly beautiful veterinarian, taking him to court to save them...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Dr. Augusta &quot;Gus&quot; North can&#39;t believe the grumpy--and annoyingly hot--builder she&#39;s facing in court cares more about demo-ing some cabin than the lives of 200 bunnies. But when the judge orders Marshall to stay on the island and help her rehome the rabbits--the entire month--she knows they&#39;re going to need to lay some ground rules.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Like, for example, absolutely no kissing. Might as well go ahead and get that in writing. Sure it&#39;s on a napkin, but that still counts. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;How hard could it be to keep their hands off each other amidst all the fighting? Surprisingly, harder than wrangling 200 bunnies...&lt;/p&gt;" />
