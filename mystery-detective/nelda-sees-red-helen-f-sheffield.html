  <title>Nelda Sees Red - Helen F. Sheffield</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;This manuscript is a contemporary novel that challenges readers to solve a murder mystery.  The suspects are a close-knit group of medical center employees. The book features a variety of well-developed characters and an exciting, unexpected conclusion.   The main setting for this mystery is a small East Texas town, with a couple of excursions to the Texas Gulf Coast and Aspen, Colorado. Each suspense filled chapter is a short story ending with a cliffhanger. These episodes are interlinked to propel the protagonist, Nelda Simmons, toward a successful resolution. Summary:    The mystery begins with the murder of a doctor who owns a health clinic. Nelda discovers the body, and calls the young sheriff, John Moore, who doesn&#39;t mind Nelda&#39;s aid in solving the mystery. Nelda has considerable experience in solving criminal cases because she assisted her late husband in his work as sheriff.   All the workers at the clinic are suspects and have good reasons for wanting him dead. None of them have air tight alibis for the night of the murder. The plot continues with the drowning of the murdered doctor&#39;s wife and warning to Nelda in Latin. This Latin phrase is one in a series left by the murderer after or before crucial events.  All the messages appear in red lipstick of a particular brand and color.   Some of the major events that occur after the two deaths are: the sabotage of Nelda&#39;s car and the major car accident that followed; the near drowning of her niece, Sue; predawn visit by the murderer; confrontation in Aspen with the killer on a downhill bicycle ride, and the final outcome.   This is a Fireside Mystery with approximately 70,000 words in twenty-six chapters&lt;/P&gt;" />
