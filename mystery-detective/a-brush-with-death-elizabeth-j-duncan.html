  <title>A Brush with Death - Elizabeth J. Duncan</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;When Penny Brannigan inherits a charming, old-fashioned cottage in the North Wales town of Llanelen, she soon realizes she has come into more than what real estate agents like to describe as a desirable period property: She&#39;s also acquired memories, mystery, and an unsolved, decades-old crime. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As Penny sorts through the belongings of her benefactor, a deceased teacher, she comes upon a packet of letters from a promising young Liverpool artist, A. Jones, who was killed in an accident in 1970. An artist herself, Penny sets out to discover who killed this painter, and is helped by a small group of townsfolk, including her business partner, Victoria Hopkirk. While at a retrospective art exhibition in Liverpool, Penny recognizes what she believes to be a watercolor painted by Jones. But it is attributed to another artist, leading her to suspect that art theft was at the heart of the case, and that Jones&#39;s death was no accident. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In her eagerly awaited sequel Duncan wonderfully revisits the bustling Welsh town and vibrant characters introduced in &lt;i&gt;The Cold Light of Mourning&lt;/i&gt;. With its lyrical prose and tantalizing puzzle, &lt;i&gt;A Brush with Death&lt;/i&gt; is a treat on many levels.&lt;/p&gt;" />
