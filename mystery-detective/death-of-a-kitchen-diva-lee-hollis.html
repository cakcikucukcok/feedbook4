  <title>Death of a Kitchen Diva - Lee Hollis</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Welcome to Bar Harbor, Maine, one of New England&#39;s most idyllic coastal towns. But as new food writer Hayley Powell is about to find out, the occasional murder can take a bite out of seaside bliss.  .  .&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Single mom Hayley Powell is barely keeping her leaking roof over her head when her boss at the Island Times gives her a new assignment--taking over the paper&#39;s food column. Hayley&#39;s not sure she has the chops--she&#39;s an office manager, not a writer, even if her friends clamor for her mouth-watering potluck dishes. But the extra income is tempting, and Hayley&#39;s chatty first column is suddenly on everyone&#39;s menu--with one exception.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When rival food writer Karen Appelbaum is found face-down dead in a bowl of Hayley&#39;s creamy clam chowder, all signs point to Hayley. To clear her name, she&#39;ll have to enlist some help, including her BFFs, a perpetually pregnant lobster woman, and a glamorous real estate agent. As she whips up a list of suspects, Hayley discovers a juicy secret about the victim--and finds herself in a dangerous mix with a cold-blooded killer. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Includes seven delectable recipes from Hayley&#39;s kitchen!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&quot;What a delicious debut mystery!&quot;  &amp;#8211;Laura Levine&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&quot;A delicious read that I ate up in one sitting.&quot; &amp;#8211;Isis Crawford&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;More Mouth-Watering Praise For Lee Hollis And Hayley Powell!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&quot;Sleuth Hayley Powell slides down as easily as one of her Lemon Drop Martinis (recipe included) and readers will be calling for a second round from author Lee Hollis.&quot; --Leslie Meier, author of &lt;i&gt;Chocolate Covered Murder&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&quot;Delicious and satisfying.
