The two Koreas, he learns, are now cooperating--very quietly--to maintain stability in the North. Stability requires that Inspector O lead an investigation into a crime of passion committed by the young man who has been selected as the best possible leader of a transition government. O is instructed to make sure that the case goes away. Remnants of the old regime, foreign powers, rival gangs--all want a piece of the action, and all make it clear that if O values his life, he will not get in their way. O isn&#39;t sure where his loyalties lie, and he doesn&#39;t have much time to figure out whether &#39;tis better to be noble or be dead.&lt;/p&gt;" />
