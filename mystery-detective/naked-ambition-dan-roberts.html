  <title>Naked Ambition - Dan Roberts</title>
      <meta name="description" content="It is a murder/mystery novel.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Nicholas Blick, a highly skilled twenty-year-old volleyball player, was &amp;quot;just snooping around&amp;quot; when he came across the corpse of a person who had been brutally murdered. The police have arrested another young volleyball player but Nick, thinking the wrong person has been locked up, begins his own investigation into the matter. In working on the case, the young athlete meets FBI Special Agent Tom Davis and eventually joins with the agent in not only investigating the murder but also in trying to find the person attempting to steal plans for the U.S. Navy&amp;#39;s new missile guidance system, one called ArrowStar. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;At the center of the espionage plot is globe-hopping Chen Xong Wu, a man of tremendous wealth, who is working behind the scenes to help bring about a shift in the power structure of the Chinese Communist party and, in doing so, attain for himself more influence as well as more wealth. As the story unfolds, it is Nick who, unwittingly, becomes the key person in bringing both of these cases &amp;acirc;??&amp;acirc;??together. Eventually, young Blick and Special Agent Davis find themselves working together in a race against the clock. Their goal: to find the murderer as well as uncover the identity of the espionage agent&amp;#39;s &amp;quot;mole&amp;quot; before the Navy&amp;#39;s plans end up in the wrong hands." />
