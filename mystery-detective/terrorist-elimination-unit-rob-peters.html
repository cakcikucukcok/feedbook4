  <title>Terrorist Elimination Unit - Rob Peters</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;For the past seven months, a continuous stream of deadly atrocities has blanketed the entire country. Now panic and fear is flowing through the veins of every Americanand with good reason. A group of extreme terrorists known as the Sons of Allah have just murdered the president, vice president, and several top government officials. As everyone wonders if a terrorist cell has infiltrated the walls of the White House, the Sons of Allah tightens its noose around America.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the terrorist group begins contaminating the American flu vaccine with a deadly toxin, the CIA directors wife and children are kidnapped and whisked away to an unknown location. Americas only hope lies with a CIA black-operative team headed by Derek Chase, a former Army Ranger with a cunning mind and off-the-charts marksmanship. As the Terrorist Elimination Unit springs into action once again, its three members must infiltrate the group and somehow find a way to stop them before it is too late for a country held hostage by a dark mission.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this political thriller, a black-operative team must outsmart a terrorist group determined to continue unleashing an evil plot against Americans.&lt;/p&gt;" />
