  <title>Memory Book - Kelli Stanley</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Miranda Corbie returns in this stunning prequel story to Kelli Stanley&#39;s acclaimed historical series.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;San Francisco, 1939.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Golden Gate International Exposition has captured the imagination of the country. The fair is a spectacular blend of mankind&#39;s newest innovations and basest urges, and Miranda Corbie is smack in the middle of it, working security at Sally Rand&#39;s. A former Spanish Civil War nurse and escort and now a private investigator, she has seen more than her share of the glitter and the grit, not to mention the people looking to make a quick buck off of them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Virginia MacAvoy&#39;s grandmother seems to be one of the unfortunate innocents. Mrs. MacAvoy came to the fair to give her granddaughters the inheritance that she had been saving for them, but it was stolen. It consisted of $500, four gold coins, and a memory book--a scrapbook where she has been saving family memories. While Virginia is convinced that Miranda will be able to track them down, her grandmother isn&#39;t and only hires Miranda to convince her granddaughters of how there is nothing to be done. Mrs. MacAvoy makes a good point, but Miranda can&#39;t understand why she&#39;s so quick to give up, and it isn&#39;t long before she&#39;s looking for more than a stolen bag but for answers as well. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With &lt;i&gt;Memory Book&lt;/i&gt;, Kelli Stanley takes readers to a time and place where the sordid and the sublime come together, making for a stunning prequel story to her to acclaimed historical series.&lt;/p&gt;" />
