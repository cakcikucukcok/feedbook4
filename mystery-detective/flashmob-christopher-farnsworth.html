      <meta name="description" content="&lt;strong&gt;Publishers Weekly&amp;#8217;s Best Books of 2017&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gifted troubleshooter John Smith, introduced in the acclaimed thriller &lt;em&gt;Killfile&lt;/em&gt;, must take down a shadowy figure who has weaponized the internet, using social media to put a price on the heads of his targets in this intense, unstoppable thriller from the author reviewers have compared to Michael Crichton, Brad Thor, and James Rollins.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a fixer for America&amp;#8217;s one percent, John Smith cleans up the messes of those rich enough to afford him. But he&amp;#8217;s no ordinary gun for hire. Smith is a man of rare gifts, including the ability to read minds. Arriving at the wedding of Kira Sadeghi, a reality television celebrity he recently saved from kidnappers, Smith witnesses a group of gunmen open fire, hitting the bride and others. Though he&amp;#8217;s unarmed, Smith cripples one of the killers and is able to pry one word from his mind: &quot;Downvote.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eager to learn more, Smith hacks into the brain of an FBI agent investigating the attack to discover the Bureau has been investigating a nefarious new threat called &quot;Downvote,&quot; an encrypted site on the &quot;dark net&quot; that lists the names of celebrities and offers a hefty bounty for anyone who can kill them&amp;#8212;unleashing an anonymous and deadly flashmob with a keystroke. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finding a mastermind on the internet is like trying to catch air&amp;#8212;unless you&amp;#8217;re John Smith. Motivated by money and revenge, he traces a series of electronic signatures to a reclusive billionaire living at sea, accompanied by a scary-smart female bodyguard who becomes Smith&amp;#8217;s partner in his quest. The hunt for their prey will lead from Hong Kong to Reykjavik to a luxury gambling resort deep in the Laotian jungle. Yet always this criminal mastermind remains one step ahead.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The only way Downvote&amp;#8217;s creator can stop Smith is to kill him . . . because while this diabolical genius can run, there&amp;#8217;s no hiding from a man who can read minds. &lt;/p&gt;" />
