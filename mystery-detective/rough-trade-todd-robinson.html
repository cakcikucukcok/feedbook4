      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;&lt;B&gt;The long-awaited second novel in Todd Robinson&#39;s Anthony Award-nominated Boo and Junior series&lt;/B&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;B&gt;The long-awaited second novel in Todd Robinson&#39;s Anthony Award-nominated Boo and Junior series&lt;/B&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;The long-awaited second novel in Todd Robinson&amp;#8217;s Anthony Award-nominated Boo and Junior series&lt;BR&gt;When a waitress at The Cellar asks Boo and Junior to scare her roommate Dana&amp;#8217;s harassing ex-boyfriend, Byron, Boo&amp;#8217;s white knight impulses kick in and they perform the job with gusto, leaving Byron bloodied but very much alive. So when Byron is found dead, they&amp;#8217;re shocked. They&amp;#8217;re even more shocked when they learn that nothing is what they originally thought, and they&amp;#8217;re being held accountable in the man&#39;s death.&lt;br&gt;&lt;BR&gt;With Junior called in for questioning, Boo is determined to clear their names by finding Byron&amp;#8217;s true killer. It&amp;#8217;s a quest in which Boo will have to face down crooked cops, crazed guard dogs, a rival security crew, the Irish mob and&amp;#151;worst of all&amp;#151;his own ingrained prejudices.&lt;br&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Action-packed, outrageously funny, and brutally honest, Rough Trade brings back crime fiction&amp;#8217;s favorite bouncers and takes them well out of their comfort zone in a novel that&amp;#8217;s whip-smart, hilarious, gritty and above all human, proving that Todd Robinson is one of the most important voices in crime fiction.&lt;/div&gt;" />
