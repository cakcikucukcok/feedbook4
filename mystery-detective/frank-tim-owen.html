  <title>Frank - Tim Owen</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Not everybody gets
to have super powers.
But then again, not everybody discovers a voodoo doll stashed away at the top of their cupboard. And even the few who do discover a voodoo doll stashed away at the top of their cupboard probably never stop to wonder what would happen if they put their own name into it. I mean, thats just insane, isnt it? Like running with scissors or poking a sleeping bear.
Steven is not an irresponsible boy and is, in fact, vehemently opposed to poking bears, sleeping or otherwise. In his defense, how was he to know it was a voodoo doll? He thought it was just a very awesome action figure with a pink pin stuck in its chest and the name Kyle Moorehouse wedged into its back.
Curiously though, Kyle Moorehouse was the previous owner of this house and, even more curiously, was also the person who had been found dead on the kitchen floor.
Coincidence? Or murder?
Steven may just have poked the bear without even knowing it." />
