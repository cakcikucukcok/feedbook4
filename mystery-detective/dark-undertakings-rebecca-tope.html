  <title>Dark Undertakings - Rebecca Tope</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Fifty-five-year-old Jim Lapsford makes an unusually healthy-looking corpse. A life-long devotee of vitamin pills and herbal remedies, it seems almost ironic that he has succumbed to a heart attack, but his doctor is convinced that this is the case. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trainee undertaker Drew Slocombe isn&#39;t so sure. As an ex-nurse, Drew is convinced that there is enough conflicting medical evidence to merit a coroner&#39;s inquest at least. And then there&#39;s Jim&#39;s personal life: in addition to a long-suffering wife, two sons, and a grieving terrier, Jim appears to have left behind a series of scorned mistresses. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Everyone else seems happy to accept the doctor&#39;s verdict, and Drew knows he shouldn&#39;t rock the boat. But can he really turn his back on murder? With plenty of suspects, zero proof, and Jim&#39;s cremation just days away, Drew sure has his work cut out for him... &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Smart, engrossing, and delightfully refreshing, &lt;i&gt;Dark Undertakings&lt;/i&gt; is another great West Country mystery from Rebecca Tope.&lt;/p&gt;" />
