  <title>The Gene Pool - E. C. Hiatt</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Growing up as the son of a professed Methodist in a town where 90 percent of the population belongs to a cult-like religious community called the Alfeta, young Casey White has had his fill of organized religion and the tight grip it maintains on his small mountain town. In his freshman year, he begins dating Naomi Stryker, an exhilarating young woman from the Alfeta community, and they dream of the future theyll build together. But Naomi does her best to keep the trouble shes facing at home a secret; she is considered a sinner for dating outside of her faith community and for entering the church of another religion. Before they can consummate their love, however, they are caught by Naomis outraged mother.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next night, a hysterical Naomi calls and shares a horrifying story: to save her, she is being forced to marry a lawyer chosen by her churchand her future husband has already violently and physically claimed her against her will. Devastated, Casey and Naomi make one last, desperate bid at happinessand then, Naomi disappears.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the wake of her absence, Casey tries to build a new life. He fathers a child with his bosss daughter before being inducted into the navy. Soon, hes on his way to Cuba for a daring rescue mission of a foreign national with family ties to the president. Caseys new life is a whirlwind of adventure and dangerbut he cant outrun his heartbreak.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When he is confronted with his past, will he have the strength to make the right choice?&lt;/p&gt;" />
