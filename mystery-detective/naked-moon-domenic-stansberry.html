  <title>Naked Moon - Domenic Stansberry</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Set in San Francisco in the crumbling vestiges of Italian North Beach, Domenic Stansberry&#39;s latest novel plunges once again into the noir underworld of Dante Mancuso. This new installment of Stansberry&#39;s critically acclaimed series, &lt;i&gt;Naked Moon&lt;/i&gt;, unearths a past Mancuso had hoped to escape. Before becoming a private investigator, Dante worked for a secret corporate security firm---known simply as the company---that prized effectiveness over legality. When Dante left, it was not on good terms. So he made sure to take enough inside information to keep himself safe from reprisal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dante, however, has his own secrets; for example, he doesn&#39;t ask his cousin Gary questions about how he keeps the family warehousing business---the one where Dante is a silent partner---in the black, while everyone else&#39;s has failed. When SFPD Detective Leanora Chin starts asking questions, Gary turns to the company for help, which they&#39;re willing to provide, so long as Dante agrees to settle his past debts by doing them one last favor: the type of favor that could drag him under for good.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Edgar Award winner Domenic Stansberry is one of the most talented crime novelists working today. His novels are dark, lyrical, and widely acclaimed, and &lt;i&gt;Naked Moon&lt;/i&gt; is no exception as it captures the sense of dread, paranoia, and quiet despair that cling to a man and a part of a city living on borrowed time.&lt;/p&gt;" />
