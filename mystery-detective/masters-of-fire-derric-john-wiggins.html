  <title>Masters of Fire - Derric John Wiggins</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The Future Is Now&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;
Man invents how to shape stone and fire. The first pinnacle of intelligence. Man discovers oil, a new way to burn fire, the second apex of intellect. Now the birth of nanotechnology and the burning of energy to move at the speed of light, bringing us to the third zenith of intelligence.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;
Ingeniously invented new technology in ambient and nanotechnology, the Chelsea Corporation could take the world into the discovery of the century. A world free of diseases and polluting energy.
&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;
Maddox Mathews, new executive for Alona, a designing company is in the middle of a merger with a fast growing corporation called Chelsea. Maddox, fond of the technology this company is manufacturing also leads him into wanting a relationship with the CEO herself, Nzingha Chelsea, the richest woman in the world. He wonders if she has mutual feelings for him or is she just using him to get what she wants for her company.
&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;
FBI Agent, Joe Clay, investigating the Chelsea Company unravels one of its darkest secrets. The company, while sharing its new technology, is assassinating top executives of competitive corporations to gain more supremacy in the corporate market. With the CIA involved, only making his attempts at cracking the issue worse. 
&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;
The CIA, implementing their will, trying to contain this new technology, has given the Chelsea Company an ultimatum. 
Professionals from the FBI and CIA could collaborate or collide trying to learn the deep nature and intentions of Chelsea.
&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;
Thus bringing Maddox, Nzingha, and Joe in the middle of things out of their control." />
