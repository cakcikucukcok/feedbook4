  <title>A Fair Maiden - Joyce Carol Oates</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;B&gt;A teenager&amp;rsquo;s involvement with an older man is not what it appears in a tale of seduction by the &lt;I&gt;New York Times&lt;/I&gt; bestselling author of &lt;I&gt;We Were the Mulvaneys&lt;/I&gt;.&lt;/B&gt;&lt;BR /&gt; &amp;#160;&lt;BR /&gt; Sixteen-year-old Katya Spivak is out for a walk on the gracious streets of Bayhead Harbor with her two summer babysitting charges when she&amp;rsquo;s approached by silver-haired, elegant Marcus Kidder. At first his interest in her seems harmless, even pleasant; like his name, a sort of gentle joke. His beautiful home, the children&amp;rsquo;s books he&amp;rsquo;s written, his classical music, the marvelous art in his study, his lavish presents to her&amp;mdash;Mr. Kidder&amp;rsquo;s life couldn&amp;rsquo;t be more different from Katya&amp;rsquo;s drab working-class existence back home in South Jersey, or more enticing. But by degrees, almost imperceptibly, something changes, and posing for Mr. Kidder&amp;rsquo;s new painting isn&amp;rsquo;t the lighthearted endeavor it once was.&lt;BR /&gt; &amp;#160;&lt;BR /&gt; What he wants from Katya is something she can&amp;rsquo;t comprehend. What Katya wants from him is something else again. As their relationship deepens, and twists, the question is who&amp;rsquo;s seducing whom? And to what end?&lt;BR /&gt; &amp;#160;&lt;BR /&gt; From a National Book Award winner and #1 &lt;I&gt;New York Times&lt;/I&gt; bestselling author, &lt;I&gt;A Fair Maiden&lt;/I&gt; is &amp;ldquo;fresh, current and gripping&amp;#160;.&amp;#160;.&amp;#160;. the insight shrewd and the violence vivid&amp;#160;.&amp;#160;.&amp;#160;.
