Sitting silently Shelby raises her field glasses and focuses in on the large white house on the bluff overlooking thenarrow valley below. A &quot;butcher&quot; lives there and he&#39;s not a pig farmer. Sweat slowly trickles down between Shelby&#39;s breasts as she reaches around and adjusts the straps holding the M11/9 Cobray automatic securely in the small of her back. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt; Assistant Director of the F.B.I., Jordan Daniels, leans back in his office chair at F.B.I. headquarters in the United States and listens as the connection from Houston, Texas to the house deep in the Amazon Jungle is made. The phone is answered and in less than ten seconds the voice of the manhe wanted to hear comes on. An orderfrom this man hadtwo ofDaniels&#39; agents killed in the United States and the time has now come to exact the priceone pays for killing an F.B.I. Agent. &lt;/P&gt;
