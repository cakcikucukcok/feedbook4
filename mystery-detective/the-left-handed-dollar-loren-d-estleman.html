  <title>The Left-handed Dollar - Loren D. Estleman</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Joseph Michael Ballista--&quot;Joey Ballistic&quot; to his mob buddies--knows most of the ways to make an illegal buck, or a &quot;left-handed dollar.&quot; That&#39;s why he&#39;s in trouble again. But his crafty lawyer, Lucille Lettermore--&quot;Lefty Lucy&quot; to just about every prosecutor she&#39;s ever humiliated in court--is determined to free him by getting all his previous convictions set aside, starting with one for attempted murder. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When she hires Detroit private detective Amos Walker to look into the old crime, she immediately has a problem: the intended victim was investigative reporter Barry Stackpole, Walker&#39;s only real friend. Walker&#39;s not thrilled to help get his buddy&#39;s would-be killer off the hook. But money&#39;s money. It won&#39;t be easy. For starters, though Joey&#39;s ex-wives grudgingly talk with Walker, he knows they&#39;re not really leveling with him. And two new murders tied to the case aren&#39;t likely to make them chattier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Walker, friendless and desperate for answers, follows a string of leads old and new straight into a war of nerves and bullets in Detroit&#39;s seedy crime-ridden underbelly. It&#39;ll be a dirty job for Walker in &lt;i&gt;The Left-Handed Dollar&lt;/i&gt;, Loren D. Estleman&#39;s twentieth Amos Walker mystery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the Publisher&#39;s request, this title is being sold without Digital Rights Management Software (DRM) applied.&lt;/p&gt;" />
