  <title>Inside Out - Elise Title</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Natalie Price, who first appeared in Elise Title&#39;s acclaimed &lt;i&gt;Killing Time&lt;/i&gt;, runs Horizon House, a halfway house for about-to-be-released convicts in the Massachusetts prison system.  A young woman in a man&#39;s world, Nat is constantly under the gun - sometimes literally - to keep things running safely for inmates and employees.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The lastest inmate to enter Horizon House is Lynn Ingram, a transsexual who was convicted of manslaughter but always claimed self-defense.  Her trial a few years earlier was a media circus, and the press attention has started back up since the news of her transfer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Just days into her transfer, Lynn is beaten into a coma.  Nat is fiercely determined to protect her charge and discover what happened, and begins to look deeper into Lynn&#39;s life with the help of Boston Homicide Detective Leo Coscarelli, with whom Nat is more emotionally involved than maybe she should be, seeing as how the mother of Leo&#39;s child is also one of the inmates at Horizon House.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before they can get very far in their investigation, though, it begins to seem that Natalie and Leo have a determined killer on their hands, and more than Lynn&#39;s life is at stake.&lt;/p&gt;" />
