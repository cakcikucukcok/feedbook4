  <title>Valiant Journey - John Callahan</title>
      <meta name="description" content="VALIANT JOURNEY .. AN ACTION PACKED DRAMA, CRAMMED WITH CONSPIRACY, DANGER, AND SUSPENSE. THIS ENERGY- FILLED PLOT WILL DRAW YOU INTO THE ACTION.
Brian, a brilliant scientist, is run off the road, badly injured, and taken to a nearby hospital only to be operated on by a naturalized Iranian brain surgeon who inserts a chip into his brain to steal the secrets about the laser project he has been working on at the Livermore Laboratories. Realizing something sinister was happening to him, Brian bolted from the hospital with a section of his skull still missing. By then, the FBI became involved and attempted to thwart the conspiracy, but in doing so they endanger Brians life. This suspense-filled plot continues to unfold, requiring his brother to choose between living a quiet life or joining the fracas to rescue his brother from eventual death by the Iranians." />
