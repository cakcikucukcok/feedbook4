      <meta name="description" content="It is the end of the nineteenth century and Emily Kelly has come to Hickory Grove, Virginia for a friend&#39;s wedding. Her focus, however, quickly turns to Blackthorn Manor and to a mystery surrounding several women who have died there. Were their deaths merely accidents? The town is in denial, but Emily soon learns that a murderer haunts the streets of this small southern town.&lt;p&gt;
Intrigued by the mystery, Emily ignores all warnings and begins a search that ultimately takes her to Blackthorn Manor. It is there a new danger, one she did not anticipate, presents itself. For threatening her investigation-as well as her heart-is the handsome and elusive Phillip Blackthorn who is just out of reach, but always on her mind.&lt;p&gt;
When she comes face to face with the murderer, Emily&#39;s life teeters on a precipice. A shocking secret is suddenly revealed and Emily discovers the disturbing past events that drove an already troubled mind to finally snap." />
