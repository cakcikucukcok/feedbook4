  <title>The Black Stone - T.S. Thomas</title>
      <meta name="description" content="In a dark cabin, young Neilla lie moments from death after being brutally attacked. With an agenda of her own an elder appears, granting Neillas grief-stricken mother a special gift to bring her back by casting her spirit from her body and into another. Casting the spirit was successful but what happens afterward is unimaginable, and in a fitful rage the spirit attempts to return to Neilla, but accidentally ravages her body to ashes. Infuriated, the spirit must be trapped, and so the elder transforms Neillas ashes to a single black stone and traps the spirit inside. More than a century passes and the stone is safe, but believing the stone is a priceless gem, Megan, a malicious teen, steals it, unknowingly releasing the spirit which sends her through time and into Neillas body to relive the events leading to her death. Besieged with anger, the spirits power is ignited and wreaks havoc on all who have hurt Megan, but her rage has no end nor does she accept responsibility for her own wrongdoings. Realizing the chaos brought by her hands, the elder decides to undo the spell but must also erase Megans existence for there are destructive secrets binding the girls. Can Megan control the fire within or suffer Neillas fate and can the elder undo her gift so that Neilla and her spirit can finally rest?" />
