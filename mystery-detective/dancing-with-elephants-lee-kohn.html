  <title>Dancing with Elephants - Lee Kohn</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This is not the end of Jake and Theo. Their adventures are just beginning. As the author, I have fully enjoyed my two leading characters. Some people might call them foulmouthed, womanizing alcoholics, but whatever you may think of them, they are real human beings true to themselves. Im moving on to other writings for a while, but by no means am I abandoning my detectives.
As of now, I have several books in the beginning stage, one of them being a childrens book.  Dont laugh. There are people out there who said I would never write a book at all, that I lack the skills. True, my grammar sucks, putting it mildly, but I didnt let that stop me. I have never had an editor. My daughter helped me with this one, and I did meet a few people on the way who lent me support and a hand or two. I wish I had a dollar for every book I gave away to people who never even opened a page. This does not make me angry; it just makes me stronger. 
If my books seem to read differently or awkwardly, then you most likely dont know that they should read a little like a screenplay. Thats because they were all written as screenplays and meant to be turned into films. I kind of like it that way. Most authors write 100 pages of story and 300 pages of description. I, on the other hand, like 300 pages of story and 100 pages of description. Leave description to the readers imagination. Im going to take a much needed rest for now, but keep an eye out for me. Im not going away for long, I assure you of that. By the way, if youre all wondering what Jake OMalley really looks like, check out Armand Assantes latest works on film or just go back and watch the Emmy award winning film, Gotti.  Thats my Jake!" />
