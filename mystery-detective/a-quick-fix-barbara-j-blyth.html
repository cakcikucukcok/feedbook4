  <title>A Quick Fix - Barbara J. Blyth</title>
      <meta name="description" content="An Edwardian seaside town is labeled the drug capital of north Norfolk, and an unlikely group of people find their lives inextricably linked to itand each other. They are the following:
Deeanna, the beautiful young wife of an MEP. She is desperately trying to save her familys country estate following her fathers death and the discovery that they are broke. An opportunity to make quick money is just too temptingand she has never been afraid to live life on the edge.
Deeannas brother, Jonathan, always wants to emulate his sister. He takes over the running of the estate when the decision is made to open it to the public. His partnership in a flying school in Holland leads him to become an unwitting courier, with dire consequences.
The mysterious Peter, who takes a job as security man to Deeannas husband, Nigel. But that is just a cover while he works for a drug enforcement agency. His dilemma is what to do about the stunningly beautiful Deeanna once he discovers that she is a main player.
Crab fisherman, Whitebait, Highly respected in a tight-knit community, he worries that his pension will not be enough to give his wife, Mary, the rewards she deserves after all the years of hard work. During his last seasons at sea with his brother, Larry, they bring ashore more than crabs and lobsters. But Larry is weak and careless. He is tempted to try the drugs himself. 
The owners of a Dutch cargo vessel. Struggling to stay in business against increasingly difficult competition, they are also lured into temptation to pay off the crippling cost of their boat.
Marti is a mixed-up young car salesman. His one ambition in life is to bring to justice the foster father who abused him as a child. He becomes a courier and quite by chance meets up with Terry, one of the other boys from the foster home. Terry, already an addict, introduces Marti to his boss.
Joe Smiththat is probably not his birth nameis obese, suffers from angina and is no longer a main player in the Amsterdam drug world. He has been hard and ruthless over the years to maintain his slice of the business, but now he is losing out to the big, dangerous international syndicates.
His sidekick, Roberto, is a suave Italian, and Deeanna likes what she sees. But he is plotting to desert Joe and move to the opposition where he believes a bigger pot of gold is waiting.
Lured by the promise of quick financial gains for their own particular needs or greed, they all become entangled in a dark and dangerous network. Their lives are changed foreveras they opt for A QUICK FIX." />
