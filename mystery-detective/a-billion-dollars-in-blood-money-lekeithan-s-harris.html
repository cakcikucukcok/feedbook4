  <title>A Billion Dollars in Blood Money - LeKeithan S. Harris</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Keisha had just received a call from one of her warehouse employees informing her that two large crates had arrived and were awaiting inspection by her. Keisha replied, Im on my way, and hung up the phone. &lt;br&gt;
	Keisha got out of her limo and her people led her to tha two large crates. And as soon as she saw them she said, Open em up. And as soon as they did Keisha saw Loco and his family inside of the crates, and didnt even flinch as she stared at their headless bodies and their heads. Keisha said to one of her guards. Hand me that bloody letter. And as soon as she had the letter she read it, balled it up, and threw it back inside tha crate. &lt;br&gt;
	Keisha left the warehouse and got into her limo and called her Army base. On the third ring a male voice answered, Commander Hopkins. Keisha said, Commander Hopkins, this is Mrs. Washington. I need you to get some airstrike teams and some ground teams together for a mission that I need handled immediately. &lt;br&gt;
	Keishas plans were to send two Steath bombers, four Harrier jets, and five thousand ground team soldiers to New Delhi and to wreck complete havoc on the ones responsible for the death of Loco and his family. &lt;br&gt;
	Keishas final instructions to Commander Hopkins were, As as soon as tha Stealth bombers have dropped tha last of their bombs send in tha Harrier jets to assist tha ground team. And Commander, call me on my cell two minutes before they make it to their target. &lt;br&gt;
	Keisha was sitting in her gazebo holding her daughter when her cell started ringing. And as soon as she answered it Commander Hopkins said, Our people are two minutes away from the target. And Keisha said, Good, and ended the call. &lt;br&gt;
	Keisha scrolled through her list of numbers on her cell until she found the one she was looking for. Then with a smile that would scare Satan himself, she pressed the send button and waited for someone to answer..." />
