  <title>Necessary Death - R. Michael Markley</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Steve pressed the barrel of the gun to the back of Rhinos head. His arm twitched.  He had never killed before.  This would be his first.  The fact that Rhino had been his mentor and had been like a father to him didnt make it any easier. It seemed impossible to pull the trigger.  Did he really want to taint his life with murder? He pulled the trigger!&lt;/p&gt;   
&lt;p&gt;In the Tradition of The Godfather, &lt;i&gt;Necessary Death&lt;/i&gt; takes you inside the seedy and gritty world of Michael Marello, a world filled with corruption, blackmail, revenge, loyalty, deceit, and murder.  Sometimes death is necessary in order for Michael Marellos business to move forward. Titan, Inc., also known as The Marello Empire to local authorities, is where Michael runs his operation. Power and control were his drug of choice.  He craved them. Pine Bridge was in his grip, and business was dealt with the way he wanted.  He had connections and favors owed by many.  When death touches him personally, things begin to change.  When loyalty and trust are questioned, Michael goes on the defensive. Forgiveness is sought and begged for.  To Michael, forgiveness meant revenge!&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Was it corrupt? Sure. Was it illegal? Yes. Did they take care of people with violence or hush money? You bet they did! It kept his enterprise strong, with no cracks. He had solid contacts in all the right places, loyalty from the underlings, and unity in the leadership. Or so he thought.&lt;/p&gt;" />
