      <meta name="description" content="Suspected serial killer Daniel Sugrue is found hanged by DCI Virgil Dodd. The case is closed and Sugrue&#39;s wife, three sons and daughter are secretly relocated in Cornwall.  DCI Dodd retires, but a series of sadistic murders identical to the ones in Cleveland follow. Suspicion falls on the three sons, and with the help of journalist Sean Foy, who plans to write a book about the notorious murders, the two men decide to investigate.   DC Sadie Dunlop goes undercover in order to befriend one of the sons, Jacob, who is the prime suspect. They become romantically involved and Sadie doubts his guilt. More suspects are introduced, including a senior detective who had a homosexual affair with Daniel Sugrue, and DCI Dodd, who it transpires is obsessed with the murders.  A complex, frightening book with an ingenious scenario. This story will leave you guessing the identity of the serial killer until the conclusion." />
