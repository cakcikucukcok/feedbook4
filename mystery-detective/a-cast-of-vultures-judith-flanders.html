  <title>A Cast of Vultures - Judith Flanders</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;There was every possibility that I was dead, and my brain hadn&#39;t got the memo. Or maybe it was that I wished I were dead. On reflection, that was more likely.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;Usually clear-headed editor Samantha Clair stumbles through her post-book-party morning with the hangover to end all hangovers. But before the ibuprofen has even kicked in, she finds herself entangled in an elaborate saga of missing neighbors, suspected arson, and strange men offering free tattoos. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By the time the grisly news breaks that the fire has claimed a victim, Sam is already in pursuit. Never has comedy been so deadly as she faces down a pair from Thugs &#39;R&#39; Us, aided by nothing more than a Scotland Yard boyfriend, a stalwart Goth assistant, and an unnerving knowledge of London&#39;s best farmer&#39;s markets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From the acclaimed bestselling author Judith Flanders,&lt;i&gt; A Cast of Vultures&lt;/i&gt; continues the sharp-witted series starring book editor and amateur sleuth Samantha Clair.&lt;/p&gt;" />
