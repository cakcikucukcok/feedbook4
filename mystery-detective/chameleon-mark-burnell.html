  <title>Chameleon - Mark Burnell</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;International spy Stephanie Patrick is about to hit the big screen in a major motion picture from the producers of the James Bond film series, starring Blake Lively and Jude Law.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Lisbeth. Bourne. Eve. Stephanie.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;What do you do when you finally see who you really are--&lt;/i&gt;what &lt;i&gt;you really are--and it&#39;s everything society rejects? You tell yourself it can&#39;t be true. That&#39;s what you do, that&#39;s the first thing. And maybe it&#39;s what you continue to do. But not me. I&#39;d already lied to myself for long enough. When the moment came, I stopped pretending I was someone else and chose to be the real me instead. I chose to be honest.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;            Brutally honest. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Stephanie Patrick was trained to infiltrate and to kill, but she thought she&#39;d left that life behind. Now, the shadowy and powerful organization known as Magenta House has recalled her for what she thinks will be one last assignment--a job that may set her free, allowing her to pursue a new life.&lt;br&gt;Konstantin Komarov, who made his fortune through the turbulent years of the post-Soviet era, is a master dealmaker. He now sits at the heart of an international financial empire and is as comfortable in Manhattan as he is in Moscow or Magadan. Like Stephanie, he wants to leave his deeply scarred past behind, but will the connections that helped make him rich let him go?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Komarov is dangerous, Stephanie is lethal. They are both chameleons. Working in the shadows, they have survived by adapting, whatever the circumstances, in worlds so brutal, violent, and full of betrayal, that they have trusted nobody but themselves. Brought together by their intersecting objective---the mysterious cypher Koba--things soon become very personal. Will finding Koba force them together or pull them apart?&lt;/p&gt;" />
