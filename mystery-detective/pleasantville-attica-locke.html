  <title>Pleasantville - Attica Locke</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WINNER OF THE HARPER LEE PRIZE FOR LEGAL FICTION&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt; BEST BOOK OF THE YEAR&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;LONGLISTED FOR THE BAILEY&amp;#8217;S WOMEN&amp;#8217;S PRIZE FOR FICTION&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From Attica Locke, a writer and producer of FOX&amp;#8217;s &lt;em&gt;Empire&lt;/em&gt;, this sophisticated thriller sees lawyer Jay Porter&amp;#8212;hero of her bestseller Black Water Rising&amp;#8212;return to fight one last case, only to become embroiled in a dangerous game of shadowy politics and a witness to how far those in power are willing to go to win.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fifteen years after his career-defining case against Cole Oil, Jay Porter is broke and tired. That victory might have won the environmental lawyer fame, but thanks to a string of appeals, he hasn&#39;t seen a dime. His latest case&amp;#8212;representing Pleasantville in the wake of a chemical fire&amp;#8212;is dragging on, shaking his confidence and raising doubts about him within this upwardly mobile black community on Houston&#39;s north side. Though Jay still believes in doing what&#39;s right, he is done fighting other people&#39;s battles. Once he has his piece of the settlement, the single father is going to devote himself to what matters most&amp;#8212;his children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His plans are abruptly derailed when a female campaign volunteer vanishes on the night of Houston&#39;s mayoral election, throwing an already contentious campaign into chaos. The accused is none other than the nephew and campaign manager of one of the leading candidates&amp;#8212;a scion of a prominent Houston family headed by the formidable Sam Hathorne. Despite all the signs suggesting that his client is guilty&amp;#8212;and his own misgivings&amp;#8212;Jay can&#39;t refuse when a man as wealthy and connected as Sam asks him to head up the defense. Not if he wants that new life with his kids. But he has to win.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Plunging into a shadowy world of ambitious enemies and treacherous allies armed with money, lies, and secrets, Jay reluctantly takes on his first murder trial&amp;#8212;a case that will put him and his client, and an entire political process, on trial.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />
