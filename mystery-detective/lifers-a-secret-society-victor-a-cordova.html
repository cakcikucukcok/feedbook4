  <title>Lifers - a Secret Society - Victor A. Cordova</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Allow yourself to awaken from the slumber of monotony you exist in and there is where you may find the answers which your heart most desires.  Under the cloak of control and power you wait anxiously for signs of salvation which you are not capable of seeing.  Pull away the layers of theory, religion and politics and face what is real.  And although I am only 11 years old, I tell you with full confidence, your beginning is near and soon you too will realize that there is more to what you might have believed about life, death, failure and success.  Look around you and open your mind to the possibility that all is not black and white or even right or wrong.  
We live among you and although you may never sense us, we are here and we are real.  Consider me your guide in a world very few are fortunate enough to see.  I am like you and I struggle to understand what I am to do with this life I have been given.  Yet what is truly important is that you understand that your existence is complex and I shall venture to say that your definition of The Circle of Life will change forever.       
Believe it or not?
I dare youdouble dare you to turn to the next page." />
