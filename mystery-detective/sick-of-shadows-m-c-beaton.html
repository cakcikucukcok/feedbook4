Despite her considerable good looks, Rose&#39;s sharp intellect and radical ideas have served to repel her would be suitors. Rose&#39;s parents, unaware of the deception, are hardly thrilled that their only child is marrying a man in trade, but Harry comes from a good family, and at the very least, they hope he will keep their troublesome daughter out of mischief.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, even a pretend engagement cannot save Rose from trouble. Bored with endless parties, teas, and balls, she befriends Dolly Tremaine, a beautiful young girl newly arrived from the country and overwhelmed by the demands of the Season. Rose is delighted to have a protégée but their friendship is cut tragically short when Dolly is found floating in a river. Harry is summoned immediately to help solve the mystery of Dolly&#39;s death, and to keep Rose from being the murderer&#39;s next victim.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Sick of Shadows &lt;/i&gt;is the exciting third book in M.C. Beaton&#39;s sparkling Edwardian Murder Mysteries Series.&lt;/p&gt;" />
