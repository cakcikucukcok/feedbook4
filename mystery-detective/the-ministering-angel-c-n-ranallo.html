  <title>The Ministering Angel - C.N. Ranallo</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Mac McConty, a one-time high-powered Chicago trial attorney, is asked by his half sister, Tracy, to find the killer of a childhood friend. The victim, a young man, was apparently lured into a dark sexual game by his lover, beautiful, older, married Angel Martin. Mac is captivated by Angel, who used the victim as a life model in her Art class. Mac tries to make a case against Michael Martin, the Vietnam veteran married to Angel. Is he trying to solve the murder or remove blame from this cool alluring beauty, a suspect as well?  Mac is distracted by another woman who stalks him, seduces him and ultimately shows him how much anger and rage he manages to hide from everyone else. Together with a crazy artist who sculpts granite monoliths, a retired cop and sister he ignored and often despised, Mac McConty searches for a murderer and the answers to his own dark disconnected past.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Very, very sexy, very, very, complicated, 
very well written.&lt;/p&gt;
