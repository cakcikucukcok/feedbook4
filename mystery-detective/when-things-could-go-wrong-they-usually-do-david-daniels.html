  <title>When Things Could Go Wrong They Usually Do... - David Daniels</title>
      <meta name="description" content="David Daniels is a detective that had a lot on his mind recently. His wife was in an accident off the side of a cliff after a fight they had. 
She was presumed missing for a few years and her body was never found. David just got back from a very long case when a woman knocked on his door and he decided to take her case. She reminded
him of a person that he knew from long ago.
The detective was sure that his old rival was somehow involved in this case. The Boss was trying to block an invention from going out on the market and would do anything to stop it. 
David had to keep his sanity together and found that most of the witnesses around him were getting killed. He was convinced that the police had
something to do with the murders because of the corruption that he experienced
when he worked downtown. The one person who could help him was the lady that
originally walked into his offi ce. It was going to take whatever strength David had
to keep her alive at all costs." />
