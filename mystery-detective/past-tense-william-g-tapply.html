  <title>Past Tense - William G. Tapply</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Brady Coyne is a middle-aged Boston attorney with a small, select clientele - one that leaves him sufficient time to pursue a personal life. That personal life currently focuses on Evie Banyon, a hospital administrator Brady has been seeing for the past year. While they are on a weekend vacation in Cape Cod, though, a determined stalker from Evie&#39;s past turns up to torment her anew. After an unpleasant confrontation with him, Brady and Evie return to their vacation cabin with a dark cloud hanging over them. The next morning, Brady wakes up to the sound of Evie, just outside the cabin, screaming for help. What he finds is the stalker&#39;s murdered body lying at Evie&#39;s feet, a body she claims to have discovered when she returned from her morning run. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now both Brady and Evie are considered prime suspects in the murder of a man with deep ties to the local community. Released by the police after intense questioning, they return to Boston, whereupon Evie disappears without word or much of a trace. Realizing just how little he knows about Evie&#39;s life, Brady Coyne must now delve into her past if he is to uncover the truth about the dead body in his front yard and find the missing Evie in time.&lt;/p&gt;" />
