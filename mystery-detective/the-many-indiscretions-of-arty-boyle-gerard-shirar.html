  <title>The Many Indiscretions of Arty Boyle - Gerard Shirar</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Arthur &quot;Arty&quot; Garret Boyle is a master manipulator. With a sociopathic personality and an IQ of 175, he embarks on a career as an art dealer and popular musician. He associates with those in the criminal world as well as the elite of society, thereby mixing his legitimate art business with stolen and forged art.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Boyle finds himself hunted by FBI agent Terry Latimer of the bureau&#39;s Art Recovery Squad and is convicted of stealing paintings from the Robert Farnsworth estate. Boyle fails to appear for sentencing and a fugitive warrant is issued. While a fugitive, Boyle masterminds the theft of a famous Rembrandt painting. He reasons that he will help the authorities &quot;find&quot; the painting in exchange for leniency for his crimes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
But Arty expands on his original plan and exploits the stolen Rembrandt painting while being pursued by Agent Latimer. Can Arty successfully escape, or will Agent Latimer finally capture him?&lt;/p&gt;" />
