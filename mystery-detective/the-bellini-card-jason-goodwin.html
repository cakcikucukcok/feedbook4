  <title>The Bellini Card - Jason Goodwin</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Investigator Yashim travels to Venice in the latest installment of the Edgar® Award-winning author Jason Goodwin&#39;s captivating historical mystery series&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jason Goodwin&#39;s first Yashim mystery, &lt;i&gt;The Janissary&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;Tree&lt;/i&gt;, brought home the Edgar® Award for Best Novel. His follow-up, &lt;i&gt;The Snake Stone&lt;/i&gt;, more than lived up to expectations and was hailed by Marilyn Stasio in &lt;i&gt;The New York Times Book Review &lt;/i&gt;as &quot;a magic carpet ride to the most exotic place on earth.&quot; Now, in &lt;i&gt;The Bellini Card&lt;/i&gt;, Jason Goodwin takes us back into his &quot;intelligent, gorgeous and evocative&quot; (&lt;i&gt;The Independent&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;on Sunday&lt;/i&gt;) world, as dazzling as a hall of mirrors and utterly compelling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Istanbul, 1840: the new sultan, Abdülmecid, has heard a rumor that Bellini&#39;s vanished masterpiece, a portrait of Mehmet the Conqueror, may have resurfaced in Venice. Yashim, our eunuch detective, is promptly asked to investigate, but -- aware that the sultan&#39;s advisers are against any extravagant repurchase of the painting -- decides to deploy his disempowered Polish ambassador friend, Palewski, to visit Venice in his stead. Palewski arrives in disguise in down-and-out Venice, where a killer is at large as dealers, faded aristocrats, and other unknown factions seek to uncover the whereabouts of the missing Bellini.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But is it the Bellini itself that endangers all, or something associated with its original loss? And why is it that all the killer&#39;s victims are somehow tied to the alluring Contessa d&#39;Aspi d&#39;Istria? Will the Austrians unmask Palewski, or will the killer find him first? Only Yashim can uncover the truth behind the manifold mysteries.&lt;/p&gt;" />
