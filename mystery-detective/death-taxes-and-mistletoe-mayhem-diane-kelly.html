  <title>Death, Taxes, and Mistletoe Mayhem - Diane Kelly</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&#39;Tis the season for death, taxes, and maybe even love under the mistletoe...&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Death, Taxes, and Mistletoe Mayhem is a brand-new holiday novella from award-winning author Diane Kelly! &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Christmas is fast approaching when IRS Special Agent Tara is assigned a new case involving a jewelry wholesaler who&#39;s repeatedly claimed large theft losses on her tax returns. Was Nadine Gramercy really robbed, or were the thefts a mere ruse to pocket tax-free profits? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tara believes Nadine belongs at the top of Santa&#39;s &quot;naughty&quot; list. Her investigation takes her to Chisholm Trail mall, where she meets Fort Worth Police Officer Megan Luz and her fluffy K-9 partner, Brigit. Though Megan believes Tara is barking up the wrong tree, she agrees to provide backup if a bust goes down. Moreover, they decide to team up as matchmakers to find love for Chris Rasmussen, a pediatric nurse who moonlights at the mall playing Santa Claus. Chris has a warm heart and a body that&#39;s hot enough to melt to the polar ice caps. This sexy-yet-sad shopping mall Santa was recently dumped by his fickle fiancée, leaving the not-so-old elf more jilted than jolly. Can Tara and Megan solve the crime...and lift Santa&#39;s spirits in time for Christmas?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Praise for Diane Kelly&#39;s Tara Holloway novels:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&quot;Smart, sassy, and so much fun!&quot;&lt;/i&gt;--&lt;i&gt;New York Times &lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;bestselling author Gemma Halliday&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&quot;Better than a refund check from the IRS!&quot; &lt;/i&gt;--&lt;i&gt;Reader to Reader Reviews&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Tara Holloway [is] a kindred spirit to Stephanie Plum: feisty and tenacious...laughs and nonstop action.&quot;--&lt;i&gt;RT Book Reviews&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />
