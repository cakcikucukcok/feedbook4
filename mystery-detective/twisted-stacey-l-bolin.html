  <title>Twisted - Stacey L. Bolin</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;When a husband is given a night of freedom by his wife after twenty years of marriage, he can hardly believe his luck. As he leans back in his bar stool and marvels at his newfound independence, he has no idea that he is about to meet someone who can make all his desires come true. But there is only one tiny catch: there are repercussions to every choice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In her collection of twelve creepy tales, Stacey Bolin shares a glimpse into what happens to a mothers imagination when a full moon hangs heavy in the sky or a deafening rain pounds the rooftop. After a woman happens upon a car accident on a back road one night, she encounters a mysterious figure and learns the truth about him from a fateful phone call. A mother tormented by what she thinks is a horrifying nightmare soon discovers that what she thinks is imagined may be real after all. When a teenage girl and her boyfriend park at an abandoned lovers field, they ignore their uneasy feelings until it is too late.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Twisted offers a glimpse into the dark, never-before-seen recesses of a mothers mind as she shares short story thrillers that will inspire wonderment about what really goes on after the sun sets every night.&lt;/p&gt;" />
