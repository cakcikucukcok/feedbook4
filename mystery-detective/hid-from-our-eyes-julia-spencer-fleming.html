Millers Kill Police Chief Jack Liddle is called to a murder scene of a woman that&#39;s very similar to one he worked as a trooper in the 50s. The only difference is this time, they have a suspect. Young Vietnam War veteran Russ van Alstyne found the body while riding his motorcycle and is quickly pegged as the prime focus of the investigation.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Present-day.
