  <title>Air Force One Has Vanished - F. Lee Chambers</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Air Force One Has Vanished is a suspense novel about the newly elected president of the United States and what appeared to be his family boarding the plane on a beautiful night in April and then disappearing in flight. He was bound from Washington to Los Angeles to make a speech. Most people felt that all the indications led to the plane having crashed near Denver, where it was last seen. But did it? No trace was found after much searching. Then the smoking sight of the ruins of a large airplane in the Rockies got everyones attention. A secret from an old man (who later disappears) leads them to a hidden cavern. The cavern was found to be guarded by unidentifiable paramilitary people who didnt recognize the FBI as an authority. Much mystery surrounded the cavern, and the FBI agents Ben Harper and Wilson Trapper intended to find out if it was real or if it was all a plot of terrorists. 
Meanwhile, war seemed to be coming about in the Middle East between Iran and Israel, which both now appeared to have nuclear weapons, and the world was tense about being drawn into something that may lead to the end of mankind. Most countries were on full alert when the very bold vice president, acting as president, sent nuclear-armed warplanes to the area, hoping to defuse the situation. But he had his own personal problems, and the people wanted the elected president found.
A suspicious waitress in Denver had secrets about the vice president and solicited one of his aides in her schemes, which would lead to turmoil. Then an assassination attempt happened when the vice president had his hands full of problems already. It appeared that his suspicious aide committed suicide, but something looked suspicious. Ben Harpers sexy dream about the waitress led him to cold sweats. Was he right about her? He wanted to find a new wife after a life-jolting divorce but not with this woman. He must keep on searching.
Ben and Wilson were led through one deception after another and then to an isolated location where they suspected the president could be held, if he was still alive. They were at wits end when they suspected that a coup to take over control from the president may be happening. Then they found out that something important was missing, which made them even more suspicious. They must find out the truth. But their search created even more mystery, and everything led them further astray. The surprise ending brought all the unusual, unanswered happenings to an end." />
