  <title>Death at Breakfast - Beth Gutcheon</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;From the acclaimed &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; bestselling author of &lt;em&gt;Still Missing, More Than You Know,&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Gossip&lt;/em&gt; comes the first entry in a stylish and witty mystery series featuring a pair of unlikely investigators&amp;#8212;a shrewd novel of manners with a dark heart of murder at its center, set in small-town New England.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Indulging their pleasure in travel and new experiences, recently retired private school head Maggie Detweiler and her old friend, socialite Hope Babbin, are heading to Maine. The trip&amp;#8212;to attend a weeklong master cooking class at the picturesque Victorian-era Oquossoc Mountain Inn&amp;#8212;is an experiment to test their compatibility for future expeditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hope and Maggie have barely finished their first aperitifs when the inn&amp;#8217;s tranquility is shattered by the arrival of Alexander and Lisa Antippas and Lisa&amp;#8217;s actress sister, Glory. Imperious and rude, these Hollywood one-percenters quickly turn the inn upside-down with their demanding behavior, igniting a flurry of speculation and gossip among staff and guests alike.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the disruption soon turns deadly. After a suspicious late-night fire is brought under control, Alex&amp;#8217;s charred body is found in the ashes. Enter the town&amp;#8217;s deputy sheriff, Buster Babbin, Hope&amp;#8217;s long-estranged son and Maggie&amp;#8217;s former student. A man who&amp;#8217;s finally found his footing in life, Buster needs a win. But he&amp;#8217;s quickly pushed aside by the &amp;#8220;big boys,&amp;#8221; senior law enforcement and high-powered state&amp;#8217;s attorneys who swoop in to make a quick arrest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Maggie knows that Buster has his deficits and his strengths. She also knows that justice does not always prevail&amp;#8212;and that the difference between conviction and exoneration too often depends on lazy police work and the ambitions of prosecutors. She knows too, after a lifetime of observing human nature, that you have a great advantage in doing the right thing if you don&amp;#8217;t care who gets the credit or whom you annoy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Feeling that justice could use a helping hand--as could the deputy sheriff&amp;#8212;Maggie and Hope decide that two women of experience equipped with healthy curiosity, plenty of common sense, and a cheerfully cynical sense of humor have a useful role to play in uncovering the truth.&lt;/p&gt;" />
