  <title>Sex, Thugs, and Rock &amp; Roll - Todd Robinson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="My fingers can&#39;t find the bullet holes. They&#39;re there, because they brought me down.     &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  Like a guitar riff sharp enough to slit a throat or the devil&#39;s amplifiers shrieking through the lonely night, this bonanza of blood and brawn rings with the vibe of the best new noir suspense.  Culled from the net&#39;s most hardcore, award-winning site, these fresh, raw, and uncut stories pack a stiff punch.  .  .  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  &quot;As long as she keeps calling me, there&#39;s hope. Hope is a dangerous thing.&quot;     &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;No matter where you turn--a pair of bisexual, ass-kicking Vikings on a slaughter trip; a sexy forty-something thief with angles as lethal as her curves; a porn-comic artist up against one deadly last laugh; a city&#39;s most savage gang under the gun and way out of time; or a south-of-the-borderland sleaze pit where everyone&#39;s a winner--no one gets out alive.  .  .  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;   &quot;Escape is a bitch. A man alone and on foot would have to be crazy to try.  Apparently he was.&quot;     &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;    Rev up for a speed-fueled hell-trip through the dark side, where a backbeat can kill, no scene falls short of badass, and the hooligans bay at the moon.  .  .  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;   &quot;This book is dripping so much blood and guts and marrow, it&#39;s impossible to read it in more than a single sitting.  Be prepared to be shattered, shell-shocked and bruised, as Thuglit&#39;s emissaries continue to write wrongs that are very, very right.&quot;  --Sarah Weinman   &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;    Big Daddy Thug/Todd Robinson&#39;s writing has appeared in &lt;i&gt;Plots With Guns, Danger City, Demolition, Out Of The Gutter, Pulp Pusher, Crimespree and Writers Digest&#39;s The Year&#39;s Best Writing 2003.&lt;/i&gt; He was nominated for a 2006 Derringer Award from the Short Mystery Fiction Society, and is the creator and chief editor of Thuglit.com.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  The stories he&#39;s edited for Thuglit.com have been nominated for several awards, including The Derringer and The Million Writer&#39;s Award, and been have been selected for &lt;i&gt;The Best American Mystery Stories&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Best Noir 2006.&lt;/i&gt;  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  He lives and works in New York with his wife (Lady Detroit), a ferret named Matilda, and three freakin&#39; cats." />
