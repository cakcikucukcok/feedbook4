  <title>The Magic Quirt - L. Ron Hubbard</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;DIV&gt;Old Laramie&amp;rsquo;s a good cook, but not good for much more than that. He&amp;rsquo;s about as heroic as Walter Brennan on a bender. But his luck&amp;mdash;and his life&amp;mdash;are about to take an amazing turn. Getting his hands on The Magic Quirt, suddenly Laramie starts performing feats of courage that would make even the Lone Ranger proud. But magic is a funny thing&amp;mdash;and as Laramie&amp;rsquo;s about to discover, sometimes it&amp;rsquo;s all an illusion.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;BR&gt;L. Ron Hubbard wrote  of his childhood: &amp;ldquo;The weather of Montana is, of course, brutal. The  country is immense and swallows up men rather easily, hence they have to  live bigger than life to survive. There were still Indians around  living in forlorn and isolated tepees. Notable among them was Old Tom, a  full-fledged Blackfoot medicine man.&amp;rdquo; Hubbard and Old Tom became blood  brothers, and the medicine man shared with him the kind of lore that  make stories like The Magic Quirt as compelling as they are.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Also  includes the Western adventures, Vengeance Is Mine!, the story of a  young man who sets out to avenge his father&amp;rsquo;s death only to commit an  act beyond redemption, and Stacked Bullets, in which a game of chance is  fixed, a whole town is cheated, and nothing but a stack of bullets can  make things right.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&amp;ldquo;Pure entertainment from first page to  last with that L.
