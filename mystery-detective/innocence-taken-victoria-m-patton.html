  <title>Innocence Taken - Victoria  M. Patton</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;This book contains &lt;strong&gt;ADULT CONTENT&lt;/strong&gt; including swear words, violence, and sex.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;INNOCENCE TAKEN &amp;ndash; Pray He Kills You Quickly&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;ndash; is a police procedure - detective - crime thriller full of disturbing twists.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A gripping forensics-based crime thriller with a disturbing ending.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A young girl&amp;rsquo;s dismembered body is found on the side of the road in rural Illinois with no ID or clues left with the body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Who could do this to a beautiful young girl?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not everyone in this close-knit community is whom they pretend to be.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lt. Damien Kaine&lt;/strong&gt;, the recently promoted head of the Vicious Crimes Unit out of Division Central in Chicago, and his partner Detective Joe Hagan are assigned to the case. &amp;nbsp;When the little evidence they have leads to the possibility that more girls have gone missing over the last ten years, and one of their own is being stalked by the killer, Profiler FBI Special Agent McGrath is brought in to assist. Having to work with the FBI agent and deal with his personal demons waging battle against him, the already stressful case, is almost unbearable for Kaine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
This book mirrors a painstaking police murder investigation, where not only are the detectives trying to figure out who is killing young girls, Lt. Damien Kaine must shoulder the weight of parents and their loss of a child. It is a disturbing look at an all too real crime.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You will be gripped from the beginning to the unsettling ending. You will also think twice about letting your teenage daughter out of your sight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you are a fan of CSI, CRIMINAL MINDS, and MOTIVE, then this new crime fiction series is for you.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;THE DETECTIVE&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Damien Kaine has been a homicide detective for over five years. However, only recently became Lieutenant in charge of the Vicious Crimes Unit at Division Central in Chicago. A specialized division that handles the worst crimes humanity has to offer. He comes from a big Italian family with deep ties to political and government entities, not only in Chicago but at the highest level. Wanting to separate himself from his family&amp;rsquo;s prominence, Damien sets his own rules. However, he is not above using his family&amp;rsquo;s influence if it means he can make sure the dead receive justice. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;THE SETTING&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Rural farming communities outside Springfield Illinois in mid-September set the backdrop for this crime novel.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The grass is just going dormant, and winter is knocking on the door. School has just begun, and farmers are planting their fall crops. As word spreads about a vicious crime, residents of this tight-knit community are about to have their vision of small-town America ripped to shreds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;OTHER BOOKS IN THIS SERIES BY VICTORIA M. PATTON&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;CONFESSION OF SIN&lt;/strong&gt;: When the Catholic Church hides secrets, those secrets get priests killed.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;FATAL DOMINION&lt;/strong&gt;: (Coming this fall!) Lt. Damien Kaine must find a killer hell-bent on destroying the political fabric of Illinois; as well as Damien and Joe&amp;#39;s life in the process.&lt;/p&gt;" />
