  <title>Earthway - Aimée Thurlo, David Thurlo</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Ella Clah has found her place on the Navajo Reservation, in her tribe, her clan, and her family.  She has seen the Diné at their worst--and at their best--as they balance the modern era with the traditional Navajo way of life. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Navajo are building a nuclear power plant on the Reservation.  Though the tribe voted for the plant, there are those who believe that nuclear power is inherently dangerous--and particularly so for the Navajo, due to past uranium mining operations that contaminated land and water and sickened many Navajo workers and their families. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A group of activists is determined to do whatever is necessary to stop the plant--assault, sabotage, domestic terrorism.  When a fellow Navajo Police officer is injured in an attack aimed at Ella&#39;s boyfriend, Ella vows to do whatever it takes to find the terrorists and bring them to justice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the Publisher&#39;s request, this title is being sold without Digital Rights Management Software (DRM) applied.&lt;/p&gt;" />
