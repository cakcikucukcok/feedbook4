  <title>The SeaOx - Terrence (T)  Mault</title>
      <meta name="description" content="In the exhilarating mystery novel The SeaOx: Book 1, Andre Laurent, sailing from Nice to LeHavre singlehanded on his SeaOx, a 44-foot Hans Christian Pilot House yacht, stops for provisions at Brest. He plans to leave the SeaOx at LeHavre and travel to Paris to rendezvous with his new love, Elspeth Vander Riis, a wealthy widow from Utrecht. Andre&#39;s idyllic lifestyle comes to an abrupt halt when his yacht is hijacked as he is about to leave Brest. He wakes up bound and strung up naked in the salon. The SeaOx is underway, but who is at the helm? A well-built young man appears and tells Andre he has given him a sedative. He wants the SeaOx and also plans to extort Andre&#39;s Paris brokerage account. The hijacker found revealing photos of Andre and Elspeth and wants to make both of them pay. Andre is tied up and given an injection. When the SeaOx docks at LeHavre, the hijacker logs in with Andre&#39;s papers and helps him to a lawyer&#39;s office where a transfer of ownership is drawn up. His lover Elspeth is also shaken down for money. Who are these thieves and what is their ultimate goal? The suspense continues in the next book in the series." />
