  <title>Twelfth of Never - Jeanne Marie Peters, Theresa Austin</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Philosophic in nature and breathtaking in scope, this profound trilogy, told in a poetic manner, is reminiscent of literary masterpieces and the conclusion of the novel is remarkable. The main focus of the story surrounds the disappearance of Elizabeth Wells&#39; beloved, John Law, who has either been kidnapped or killed by her crafty father. But the lovers have a sacred secret in their understanding of time and space as illusive and their promise to wait until the &#39;Twelfth of Never&#39; should they ever be separated. The heroine, Elizabeth, devotes her life to this assurance; she never ages from the night the lovers were separated. There are those who believe she has gone mad; attempts on her life do not deter her devotion as the material sense of time stretches on. The authors are unaware of any other story with the
exact and remarkable solution to a mystery." />
