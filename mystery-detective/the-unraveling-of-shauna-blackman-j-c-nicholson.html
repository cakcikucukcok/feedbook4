  <title>The Unraveling of Shauna Blackman - J.C. Nicholson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="On a cold November night while the world slept, Shauna Blackman left Massachusetts believing she murdered her husband.  Her need to escape made sense except she didn&#39;t have a husband.  It was the night Shauna fell into a rabbit hole, the story not to  be confused with Alice in Wonderland.   If she knew of a state with heat to spare she wuld have gone there, but it was the first place anyone would look for her.  The only one who knew how her mind worked was her twin sister JessE, but JessE couldn&#39;t be trusted.  Something was up with that girl.
Trapped in a tiny town in Maine overrun with secrets, lies, and murder, fate turned against her.  The bartender in town blamed her for a murder and the man she fell in love with was a bounty hunter. It was a no win situation unless fate had a change of heart." />
