  <title>The Sweet Golden Parachute - David Handler</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Sweet Golden Parachute&lt;/i&gt;, Handler&#39;s fifth novel in this charming and edgy series displays his deftness in creating memorable, distinctive characters and for crafting uniquely entertaining mysteries.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A storm is brewing in Dorset. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Poochie Vickers, the local aristocrat, is becoming even more eccentric in her old age. She&#39;s taken up shoplifting and reckless driving but refuses to see a doctor. Her worrisome daughter, Claudia, is angling to take over the family fortune, which makes some of the would-be beneficiaries uneasy. Two of Dorset&#39;s biggest troublemakers are being released from prison. And the bad blood between these two families, rich on the one hand, swamp Yankee on the other, could come to a boiling point: Two young people from the families are dating, to no one&#39;s delight but their own.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Someone is bound to snap, and someone does, resulting in the brutal murder of a harmless and homeless man who went about town collecting recyclables. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While Des is trying to track down the murderer, she&#39;s also trying to wrap her head around the idea of marrying Mitch. When so many things are going wrong, loving someone seems like a big risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Handler once again delivers a top-notch tale of crime and intrigue.&quot; - &lt;i&gt;Publishers Weekly&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />
