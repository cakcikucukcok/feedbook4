  <title>Mystery at Morania - Judy Conlin</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Nancy Moran, a journalist and former hostess at the Pink Pussycat Club, becomes both a bride and a widow in the same week. On the last day of her honeymoon in Las Vegas, her husband Greg meets his friends for a drink. After hours of waiting for Greg to return, and going from angry to panicked, Nancy finally receives a call. Greg has been taken to the hospital for alcohol poisoning-and is pronounced dead on arrival.&lt;/p&gt;
When she arrives at Morania, her husband&#39;s family home, Nancy is surrounded by hostility, suspicion, and a web of secrets. Many members of the family have never heard of her. Then she&#39;s introduced to Greg&#39;s supposed fiance. As one disturbing event follows another, Nancy doesn&#39;t know who to trust. Unraveling what is going on at Morania and deciphering her feelings for the family&#39;s lawyer keep Nancy&#39;s nerves on edge. Even the neighbors seem to be up to something.&lt;/p&gt;
As she gets acquainted with Greg&#39;s family and friends, more questions spring up than she can answer. But Nancy only wants the answer to one question: why doesn&#39;t Greg&#39;s family know anything about his life-or about her?" />
