  <title>1 Law 4 All - Billy Angel</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Greed, Arrogance, Power and Pride versus Fairness, Generosity, Innocence and Justice&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Novels written by Billy Angel pierce the cloak of political perception surrounding Washington DC. 1 Law 4 All is an aggressive tale portraying the inner workings of the brutal and erotic creature that is politics in the United States today. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The human nature exhibited by the characters is far from fictional. Revenge catalyzes their actions in a terrifyingly, plausible style. Political power truly exposes the darkest corners of the character&amp;#39;s souls.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;1 Law 4 All is a stirring saga of revenge erupting from a catastrophic event in the life of a young Samoan girl. Kitiona Tuafa reluctantly leaves her home in American Samoa to find her family&amp;#39;s killers. Her adventure begins in the City of San Francisco and eventually reaches into the halls of the United States Congress.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;While being stalked, harassed and chased around the City, Kitiona stumbles upon a retired legal professional and, eventually, an idealistic, ragtag group of law students. Together, they theorize who masterminded the fire that killed Kitiona&amp;#39;s family, only to be terrorized themselves by the same group of killers. These events launch Kitiona and her group on a journey that throws suspicion in the direction of a Senator, a mob boss and a multi-national corporation.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;1 Law 4 All portrays simple-minded politics in a plausible manner. The storyline skillfully merges daily  drama with life&amp;#39;s little pleasures. As the existence of good and evil becomes evident, the artfully contrived personal exchanges of the characters draw the reader into the book&amp;#39;s reality.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;Things do not happen. Things are made to happen.&amp;quot; - JFK&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Addicted to Politics? Believe politicians should live by the same laws as us?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Billy Angel&amp;#39;s 1 Law 4 All series will have you cheering for the good guys!" />
