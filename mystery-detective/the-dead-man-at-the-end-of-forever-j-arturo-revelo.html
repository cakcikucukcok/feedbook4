  <title>The Dead Man at the End of Forever - J. Arturo Revelo</title>
      <meta name="description" content="He is a private detective in San Francisco, but he cant stay away from Bakersfield. You can call Richard Tessa any day, just dont call him Dick. The Maltese detective from Bakersfield gets cases solved. He treats every client the same way, with contempt. Sarcastic, blunt, opinionated, he always says whats on his mind no matter whos paying him or holding the gun to his face, be a religious zealot or the Canadian Secret Service. 
The Dead Man at The End of Forever, are three stories of murder and intrigue. The tales, described as the best detective stories in years, involve the murders of Tony Sebastian, a rich man going punk rocker; Mary Carlston, a public defender killed defending a terrorist; and Oscar Wedemayer Jones, also known to his terrorist friends and his wife as Hans Shepherd.  Twists and turns, from the foggy streets of San Francisco, to the top of the Southern Sierra Nevada, from sleepy San Jose to bursting at the seams L.A. 
Guns, bullets, corpses and money, the stuff Richard Tessa cant stay away from whenever he is on the trail of who done it." />
