  <title>Fateful Betrayal - Royan Harris</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;When government documents wind up in the wrong hands, US Air Force Sergeant Tafari Spencer becomes the face of the scandaland now he must prove his innocence in the face of a massive government conspiracy. He is charged with helping notorious Jamaican scammers who have attempted to acquire US visas fraudulently. To make matters worse, he has reason to suspect that he has been betrayed by someone close to himvery close to him. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His life in a tailspin, Tafari must rely on inexperienced military lawyers to defend him. The evidence tying him to a Jamaican visa fraud ring is circumstantial at bestbut hes about to learn how little of a difference that makes with the islands legal sharks. And once hes acquitted of human trafficking charges in Jamaica, he is cleared to travel back to America to face further criminal prosecution from the US Department of State, Uniform Code of Military Justice, and ultimately the ICE, the most feared beast in the bureaucratic jungle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a time when the issue of illegal immigration and human trafficking is plaguing America, an extraordinary trial is about to begin. As the prosecutors circle like vultures, Tafaris friends pray for his deliverance. As the scammers in Jamaica vow to silence him and his family before he testifies, another story is about to unfold. Under pressure to send a strong message, the legal landscape changes, offering no safe haven for Tafari and his legal team. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Staying out of jail seems next to impossible, but for Tafari, jail will be the least of his worries.&lt;/p&gt;" />
