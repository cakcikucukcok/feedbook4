  <title>Once a Crooked Man - David McCallum</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;A deliciously quirky crime novel from David McCallum, the beloved actor known for his portrayal of Illya Kuryakin on &lt;i&gt;The Man From U.N.C.L.E. &lt;/i&gt;and Dr. Donald &quot;Ducky&quot; Mallard on &lt;i&gt;NCIS&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Crime pays. And pays well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sal, Max and Enzo Bruschetti have proved this over a lifetime of nefarious activity that they have kept hidden from law enforcement. Nowhere in any file, on any computer is there a record of anything illegal from which they have profited. But Max has a problem. His body is getting old and his doctor has told him to take it easy. Max has decided that the time has come for the family to retire.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But when young actor Harry Murphy overhears the Bruschetti brothers planning changes to their organization, including the murder of a man in London who knows too much, the Bruschetti&#39;s plans begin to unravel. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After Harry makes the well-intentioned if egregious mistake of trying to warn the Bruchetti&#39;s intended victim he finds himself alone in a foreign country, on the wrong side of the law, with a suitcase full of cash and a dangerous man on his trail. And while his good looks, charm and cheerful persistence may prove assets in the turbulent events that follow, none of Harry&#39;s past roles have prepared him for what happens next.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At turns tense and funny, &lt;i&gt;Once a Crooked Man&lt;/i&gt; is infused with the infectious charm that has made David McCallum one of television&#39;s longest running, most-beloved stars.&lt;/p&gt;" />
