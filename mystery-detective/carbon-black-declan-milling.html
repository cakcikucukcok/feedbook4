  <title>Carbon Black - Declan Milling</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;It&#39;s the end of the decade and the international response to climate change has defaulted to a piecemeal carbon market, which a new UN body is trying to make work. But the carbon market has become a battleground between anti-capitalist activists, now aggressively militant, and market proponents. And there are others, intent on protecting the status quo, and their financial interests in it. Emil Pfeffer, the new body&#39;s Director of Market Integrity, thinks he&#39;s making a difference, but he hasn&#39;t really left the comfort zone of his cocooned bureaucrat&#39;s existence. He&#39;s addressing C-World, the biggest carbon market conference and trade fair on the global circuit, when a questioner challenges the integrity of one of Emil&#39;s own staff, allegedly under arrest. Events half a world and, for Emil, an earlier lifetime away in Papua New Guinea are about to change everything. His cosseted, self-contained, somewhat self-satisfied world is about to be turned upside down. Risks need to be taken, sacrifices made, to achieve what is worth saving - his organisation&#39;s credibility and purpose. His colleagues&#39; reputations. But then he realizes, it&#39;s his life that&#39;s on the line.&lt;/div&gt;" />
