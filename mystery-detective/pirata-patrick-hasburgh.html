  <title>Pirata - Patrick Hasburgh</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;From &lt;em&gt;21-Jump Street&lt;/em&gt; writer and series creator Patrick Hasburgh, a part thriller, part family novel about an ex-pat American living and surfing in Mexico, the family he loves, and the murder he witnesses, in the vein of Don Winslow&amp;#8217;s &lt;em&gt;The Dawn Patrol.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;#8220;It&amp;#8217;s rare to find a novel that&amp;#8217;s so harrowing, funny and touching at the same time, but Patrick Hasburgh somehow pulls it off. His surf-bum narrator is a new classic&amp;#8212;think of Philip Marlowe, on a longboard.&amp;#8221;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160; &amp;#8212;Carl Hiaasen, &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; bestselling author of &lt;em&gt;Razor Girl&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;#8220;Fueled by equal parts humor and suspense, &lt;em&gt;Pirata&lt;/em&gt; makes for a fast and satisfying read.&amp;#8221;&amp;#160;&amp;#160; &amp;#8212;&amp;#160;Kem Nunn, author of National Book Award Finalist &lt;em&gt;Tapping the Source&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&quot;Going straight at the stuff that scares you is good advice. I just didn&amp;#8217;t have the courage to do it&amp;#8230;&amp;#8221;&lt;em&gt;&amp;#8212;Nick Lutz&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a former life, Nick Lutz, sold cars in the Golden State. He had a wife and a young son, and they struggled along until Nick was shot in the head when a potential customer hijacked the car he was demonstrating. The incident sets off a bad-luck domino fall, and he loses an eye, his job, his family, and, eventually, his self-respect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With nothing left, Nick heads for Mexico, where he sheds his former self among an eclectic group of expats and locals, who fondly name him &amp;#8220;Pirata&amp;#8221; on account of his eye patch. There on the beaches of Sabanita, Nick and his buddy Winsor drink, surf, and&amp;#8212;most of all&amp;#8212;escape, buoyed away from their pasts on south swells and Tecate. Nothing epic. That is until Winsor&amp;#8217;s girlfriend, Meagan, ends their abusive relationship and flees with her two boys to the safety and solace of Nick&amp;#8217;s beachside casita. A monsoon season fling of convenience turns into a torrid love affair as new loyalties and dark secrets are shaped into something like a family. But when the local &lt;em&gt;polic&amp;#237;a &lt;/em&gt;struggle to identify a body that has washed up in the surf, Nick realizes his secrets&amp;#8212;and sins&amp;#8212;have caught up with him. And there are dangerous new surprises that have yet to roll in with the tide. . . . &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A gifted storyteller, Hasburgh drops readers into the middle of a gripping, heartwarming, viscerally compelling page turner. At once tender and deadly hysterical, &lt;em&gt;Pirata &lt;/em&gt;is a novel readers won&amp;#8217;t soon forget. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;#160;&lt;/p&gt;" />
