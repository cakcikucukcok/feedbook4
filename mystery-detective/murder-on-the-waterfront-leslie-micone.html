  <title>Murder on the Waterfront - Leslie Micone</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Maggie Pennyworth, a homeless woman, walks along the 1910 Hoboken waterfront now cast in darkness. Seeing the shape of a bundle under the pier, she kicks it, hoping its money. Instead, its Fred Throckmorton, a recently murdered business man whose disappearance is front-page news. She runs to a trusted resident of the docks, Mike Chambers, who looks out for the less fortunate. However, Chambers is not his real identity. A man with a great deal of clout and the ability to live in the shadows has long arms influencing more than just the docks. Digging into the details of Throckmortons death proves more dangerous than expected. An unlikely friend, Jerry Murphy, gets involved, and there are those who would like Chambers out of the waypermanently. Jerry and his family have an impact on Chambers, causing him to begin questioning where his loyalties lie: the job or those he loves." />
