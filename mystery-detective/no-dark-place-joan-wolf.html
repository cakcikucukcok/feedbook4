  <title>No Dark Place - Joan Wolf</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;In the turbulent realm of Norman England, a young nobleman discovers that his identity is the link to an incredible mystery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hugh Corbaille has just lost the person he cares for most in the world, his adoptive father, the Sheriff of Lincoln. While Hugh&#39;s grief is still raw, he is approached by a visiting knight with an unbelievable tale: Hugh may actually be Hugh de Leon, sole child of the Earl of Wiltshire, mysteriously abducted thirteen years before on the day of his father&#39;s murder. Despite his loyalty to the family that raised him and his reluctance to be anyone but their son, Hugh begins to believe he could indeed be the missing heir.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With no memory of his early years, Hugh sets out to find the truth. He soon unearths a web of death and intrigue beginning in the lost days of his childhood when he may have witnessed the stabbing of his birth father.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tormented by this tragic puzzle, Hugh must turn to the mother he has never known, a court of straligers, and the young woman whose sympathy and healing are his one support, to try to piece together his splintered past and put an end to a reign of danger and deception.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In &lt;em&gt;No Dark Place&lt;/em&gt;, award-winning novelist Joan Wolf spins all all-absorbing medieval mystery of violent ambitions, inescapable bonds, and searing dreams of final justice.&lt;/p&gt;" />
