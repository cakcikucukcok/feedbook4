  <title>The Shimmering Blond Sister - David Handler</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;In this delightful new adventure featuring the mismatched crime-fighting duo of film critic Mitch Berger and Connecticut state trooper Des Mitry, Mitch&#39;s New York City past and his Dorset present collide head on.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Back when Mitch was a chubby thirteen-year-old living in Stuyvesant Town, Beth Breslauer, a lovely blond single mother, lived across the hall with her son, Kenny. These days, she&#39;s a wealthy widow who owns a condominium in the Captain Chadwick House, the Dorset Historic District&#39;s most exclusive condo complex. Kenny is engaged to marry Mitch&#39;s yoga teacher, Kimberly Farrell. Kimberly&#39;s parents are Beth&#39;s neighbors. They are also social pariahs. Her father was one of the Wall Street power brokers responsible for the sub-prime home loan meltdown and her mother is praying that Kimberly&#39;s elaborate engagement party will endear them to their lost friends. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, Augie Donatelli, a retired police detective who manages the Captain Chadwick House, is positive he&#39;s figured out the identity of the infamous Dorset Flasher, an elusive, ski-masked figure who has been terrorizing wealthy widows after dark. He also believes that Beth is the proud descendent of a long line of professional thieves. He demands that Des do something about it, but Des dismisses his charges as the wild rants of a lonely, bitter drunkard, which is rather unfortunate---because when Augie turns up dead, Des is included in the round-up of suspects.  That leaves it up to Mitch to find out what really happened, even though it means he&#39;ll have to find out more about the people in his life than he ever wanted to.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Shimmering Blond Sister&lt;/i&gt; is David Handler&#39;s most emotionally gripping book in the series yet.&lt;/p&gt;" />
