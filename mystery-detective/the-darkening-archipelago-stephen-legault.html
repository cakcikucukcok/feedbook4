  <title>The Darkening Archipelago - Stephen Legault</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Eight months after his own brush with death over Alberta&#39;s Cardinal Divide, Cole Blackwater has learned that his good friend and former client Archie Ravenwing is presumed dead on the waters of British Columbia&#39;s Broughton Archipelago. Days before his disappearance, Ravenwing was on the brink of unravelling a corporate conspiracy surrounding an outbreak of sea lice that could decimate wild salmon along the BC coastline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While Cole and newspaper reporter Nancy Webber search for answers, Cole is haunted by the dark secret surrounding his own father&#39;s mysterious death. For Nancy Webber, whose long-forgotten feelings for Cole have risen to the surface again, getting to the bottom of Cole&#39;s family history becomes both a professional and personal obsession.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Darkening Archipelago&lt;/i&gt;, the second book of the Cole Blackwater series, is a race to keep both human souls and wild ecosystems from falling into darkness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;Praise for &lt;i&gt;The Darkening Archipelago&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&quot;Raymond Chandler gave us Philip Marlowe, a world-weary investigator who solved murders with a quip and an eye for detail. Stephen Legault gives us Cole Blackwater, a hardboiled environmental investigator with a dark past and a fast right hook.... Like Chandler, Legault tells a story that is fast-paced and rich, revealing just enough to keep our eye following the ball under the cup.&quot;&lt;br&gt;~ Mayana C. Slobodian, &lt;i&gt;Monday Magazine&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&quot;An exciting read.... His stories reveal true human conflict and emotion, and portray characters with varied opinions about current issues, such as how a town with no economy might look at salmon farming as an opportunity. Legault has no shortage of characters or ideas.&quot;&lt;br&gt;~ Steve Carey, &lt;i&gt;Victoria Times-Colonist&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />
