  <title>Needle and Thread - Derrel Jack Tooman</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Christian Rookwood, CEO of Rayfield Industries, the largest clothier in North Carolina, was brutally murdered at his plant early one morning. The police found Christian with a large pair of scissors embedded in his chest, laying neatly on a cutting table with his mouth sewn tightly closed. He was the first prominent victim in Raleigh. Then another, and another. Would these murders ever stop? 
Mike Whitehouse, Times Investigative Reporter, was given the task of solving these crimes when it became apparent the city police were not taking these murders seriously. The beautiful Police Lt Sally Michaels, officer in charge of the Forensic Division, provided Mike with all the privileges of home, but no substantial clues. Each murder was executed flawlessly. The murderer always had access to the buildings, alarms were disengaged, no incriminating fingerprints were found, and no one saw anyone, or anything. Leaders began accusing each other, and even Mike became a suspect. Would he be the next victim, or the next police scapegoat?" />
