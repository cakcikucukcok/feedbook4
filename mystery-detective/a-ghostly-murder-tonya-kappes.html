  <title>A Ghostly Murder - Tonya Kappes</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Emma Lee raines knows there&amp;#39;s only one cure for a bad case of murder&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I told you I was sick,&lt;/em&gt; reads the headstone above Mamie Sue Preston&amp;#39;s grave. She was the richest woman in Sleepy Hollow, Kentucky, and also the biggest hypochondriac. Ironic, considering someone killed her&amp;#8212;and covered it up perfectly. And how does Emma Lee, proprietor of the Eternal Slumber Funeral Home, know all this? Because Mamie Sue&amp;#39;s ghost told her, that&amp;#39;s how. And she&amp;#39;s offering big bucks to find the perp.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The catch is, Mamie Sue was buried by the Raines family&amp;#39;s archrival, Burns Funeral Home. Would the Burnses stoop to framing Emma Lee&amp;#39;s granny? With an enterprising maid, a penny-pinching pastor, and a slimy Lexington lawyer all making a killing off Mamie Sue&amp;#39;s estate, Emma Lee needs a teammate&amp;#8212;like her dreamboat boyfriend, Sheriff Jack Henry Ross. Because with millions at stake, snooping around is definitely bad for Emma Lee&amp;#39;s health.&lt;/p&gt;" />
