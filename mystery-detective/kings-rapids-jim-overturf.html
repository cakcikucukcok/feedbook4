      <meta name="description" content="Race driver Kurt Maxxons quiet life of racing stockcars and training his new puppy, Beau, is turned upside down after he finds well-known local driver Rusty Gallegar shot to death at the racetrack. Very quickly into the investigation, the police arrest Alisa Sharpe, Gallegars live-in mistress, who Gallegar kicked out of his life a week before the shooting. According to the police, Alisa lied about key items, and the evidence against her is compelling. Kurts friend Mutt Sparks adamantly maintains that Alisa is innocent, and asks Kurt to help her. Kurt visits Alisa in jail and agrees Sharpe is probably not the killer, then launches his own investigation to prove it. Kurt discovers Gallegar was preparing to sell his auto body shop and quietly leave town, apparently running away with a woman.

Love, infidelity, jealousy, gossip, and revenge surround Kurt Maxxon as he analyzes information, using his unique logic and approach, to find out the answer to the questionWho killed Rusty Gallegar?" />
