  <title>The Family Business - Carl Weber, Eric Pete</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Meet the Duncans, a prominent family from Jamaica, Queens. They may be known for their big house, fancy cars, and lavish lifestyle, but that doesn&#39;t make them immune from some over-the-top drama.       L.C. Duncan has run his successful car dealership in Jamaica, Queens for more than thirty years, but when the recession hits and the competition gets a little rough, some say it&#39;s time for him to retire. Palm trees and golf sound like fun, but L.C. still has a few tricks up his sleeve. Which one of his kids can he trust to run the family business?Paris could give any supermodel a run for her money. When she walks in the room, all heads turn, but it&#39;s her anger issues and knack for getting into trouble that most people remember. She&#39;s much more dangerous than anyone gives her credit for-except, perhaps, her father. Orlando is the most obvious choice to lead the Duncans into the future. He has proven himself to be quite the businessman over the years;but sometimes, the most obvious choice isn&#39;t always the best choice. Harris Grant is married to L.C.&#39;s oldest daughter. In Harris&#39;s opinion, he&#39;s the most qualified to run the family business. Now he just needs to convince L.C. . . . and make sure no one discovers the secret he&#39;s been keeping.Harris isn&#39;t the only one with skeletons in the closet. The Duncan family has been keeping a secret of their own-a deep, dark secret that, if revealed, will shock the entire community." />
