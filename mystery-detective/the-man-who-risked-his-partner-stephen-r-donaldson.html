  <title>The Man Who Risked His Partner - Stephen R. Donaldson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Stephen R. Donaldson is one of America&#39;s acclaimed storytellers. But in the 1980s, he published three novels about private investigators Mick Axbrewder and Ginny Fistoulari, as paperback originals under the pseudonym &quot;Reed Stephens.&quot; In 2001, Tor published a fourth novel about these characters, &lt;i&gt;The Man Who Fought Alone,&lt;/i&gt; this time in hardcover under Donaldson&#39;s own name. Now Donaldson has returned to the first three novels in the sequence, rewriting and expanding them. &lt;i&gt;The Man Who Killed His Brother&lt;/i&gt; was the first, and &lt;i&gt;The Man Who Risked His Partner&lt;/i&gt; is the second of the three.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mick &quot;Brew&quot; Axbrewder is a P.I. who&#39;s seen better days. Deeply into alcoholism, some time back, he accidentally shot and killed a cop.  Worse, the cop turned out to be his brother.  Even worse, in a case not long after that, his partner Ginny Fistoulari blew off her own left hand, protecting him and others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now Mick works mostly as hired muscle for Ginny. They don&#39;t talk much.  But their latest client&#39;s story doesn&#39;t add up. They&#39;re going to have to start working better together. And Brew&#39;s going to have to face some of his own worst fears.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the Publisher&#39;s request, this title is being sold without Digital Rights Management Software (DRM) applied.&lt;/p&gt;" />
