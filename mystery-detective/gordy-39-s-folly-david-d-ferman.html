  <title>Gordy&#39;s Folly - David  D Ferman</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After returning from a night on the town, Gordy Tyler caught a young female burglar inside his North Dallas townhouse. Wearing nothing but sheer, skin-colored skivvies and a smile; at first sight, Gordy was sure that she was buck naked. However, he did not call the police. Sex had nothing to do with his decision; his survival did. The late-night burglar, Priscilla Lopez-McDonald, had been told by her boss to shoot Gordy if he got in her way. A 1980&amp;#39;s era hippy flower-power mystic, Prissy could not pull the trigger, so she reverted to her startling &amp;quot;show and go&amp;quot; act that had always worked for her before; but not this time.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Surprisingly, Prissy was not looking for expensive jewelry, a stash of cash or anything else of value. Instead, she was searching for three seemingly worthless brass and clay tourist trinkets that Gordy bought the preceding week in the restored former ghost town of Jerome, Arizona. That revelation indicated that Gordy was indeed in a heap of trouble: i.e., a group of Sicilian outlaws wanted him null and void, and would undoubtedly try again. Unfortunately, Gordy did not know anything about the bad guys or much about Jerome; but Prissy said that she did. Therefore, Gordy needed Prissy to identify those dangerous scoundrels, and Prissy needed Gordy to get out of Dallas and stay out of Texas&amp;#39; infamous crossbar hotels.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Initially, that was a match brewed in the deepest, darkest, dreariest abbess of Hades. Prissy believed that even though she burglarized Gordy&amp;#39;s home and injured him in the process, has no morals, no conscience, and no shame, she should get preferential treatment just because she is so darned good looking. A self-centered opportunist, she vacillated back and forth between Gordy&amp;#39;s good guys and the Sicilian bad/nasty guys depending on which group she believed would win at any particular moment.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Back in Dallas, the Sicilian criminals murdered two of Gordy&amp;#39;s best friends and burned down both townhouses when those crooks could not find Gordy or those cheap tourist trinkets. Due to that tragedy and a gaggle of other difficulties along the way, Gordy and Prissy had left Dallas together, but arrived in Jerome separately. Later, with the help of Sean and Katie O&amp;#39;Neill, who were originally introduced in Erin Go Kill, they had to run a gauntlet of 12-gauge shotgun fire from both sides of Jerome&amp;#39;s main street, then shoot their way out of town while blocking pursuit with a flatbed truck loaded with telephone poles.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
While scouring the canyons around nearby Sedona, Gordy and Sean broke the code etched onto two of the cheap tourist trinkets. They then drove to the south rim of the Grand Canyon where Prissy and Katie each rented double rooms at a hotel as if Gordy and Sean were staying with them. But under the cover of darkness, Gordy and Sean hiked down a narrow, hazardous trail to the Colorado River to avoid the Sicilian criminals. However, those guys showed up loaded for bear in a surplus military helicopter the next morning at Havasu Falls. That&amp;#39;s when the story gets really exciting.&lt;/p&gt;" />
