  <title>Evening Street - Julia Keller</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;By day, she&#39;s a tough-minded prosecutor in Raythune County, West  Virginia, a region scarred by poverty and prescription drug abuse. By  night, Bell Elkins takes on a softer role. She volunteers at an  auxiliary intensive care unit where nurses deal with the youngest and  most vulnerable victims of drug abuse: the children born to mothers  addicted to painkillers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The place is known as Evening Street,  and it is here Bell comes whenever she can spare the time. She rocks  ailing infants to sleep, and she provides what medical science-for all  of its marvels-cannot: A simple human touch.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One terrifying  night, the distraught father of an Evening Street baby breaks into the  facility. Gun in hand, he holds the staff hostage and demands a  reckoning for a family grudge--with helpless infants only inches away. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And  so begins a standoff at Evening Street. Bell Elkins is swept up into  the crisis, as the drama escalates toward a lethal flashpoint. At the  center of it all is a baby, only hours old, but already ancient in his  knowledge of pain.&lt;/p&gt;" />
