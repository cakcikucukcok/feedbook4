  <title>Jaded Justice - Richard Caines</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Rick Butler, once a Special Forces soldier, is currently a private investigator specializing in evidence for divorce cases. He rarely encounters violence; instead, he usually finds himself neck-deep in scandalthat is, until hes hired to follow Anne Blackmon. It would have been an openand-shut case, if Blackmon hadnt ended up dead while on Ricks watch. Now, hes suspected for her murder at the behest of Dallass Police Chief.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rick didnt know Mrs. Blackmon was mixed up in something much more serious than an affairsomething involving the CIA. A group of agents are on the warpath for one last shred of revenge. The agents were involved in the Cuban Bay of Pigs offensive, but they know someone tipped off Fidel Castro about the incoming attack. Because of this leak, many of the agents friends were killed in Cuba. Now its time for some payback, and Rick might be a perfect diversion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The CIA agents suspect Castro was working with American mafia kingpins, who gave him classified knowledge. In order to save himself, Rick has to figure out how to prove their suspicions, how Mrs. Blackmon was involved, and what it all has to do with the Kennedy assassination. Unfortunately, the guilty party may be much closer than Rick knows, as Dallass law enforcement comes under dangerous scrutiny that may get everyone killed.&lt;/p&gt;" />
