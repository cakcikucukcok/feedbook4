  <title>The Dark Lake - Sarah Bailey</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;b&gt;A tight-knit community is shocked by revelations from decades past in this &quot;enthralling&quot; (&lt;i&gt;Associated Press&lt;/i&gt;) literary mystery that &quot;will keep you racing toward the end&quot; (Lisa Gardner). &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; The lead homicide investigator in a rural town, Detective Sergeant Gemma Woodstock is deeply unnerved when a high school classmate is found strangled, her body floating in a lake. And not just any classmate, but Rosalind Ryan, whose beauty and inscrutability exerted a magnetic pull on Smithson High School, first during Rosalind&#39;s student years and then again when she returned to teach drama. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  As much as Rosalind&#39;s life was a mystery to Gemma when they were students together, her death presents even more of a puzzle. What made Rosalind quit her teaching job in Sydney and return to her hometown? Why did she live in a small, run-down apartment when her father was one of the town&#39;s richest men? And despite her many admirers, did anyone in the town truly know her? &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  Rosalind&#39;s enigmas frustrate and obsess Gemma, who has her own dangerous secrets--an affair with her colleague and past tragedies that may not stay in the past. Brilliantly rendered, &lt;i&gt;The Dark Lake&lt;/i&gt; has characters as compelling and mysteries as layered as the best thrillers from Gillian Flynn and Sophie Hannah." />
