  <title>Murder in the Chilcotin - Roy Innes</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The third book in Roy Innes&#39; mystery series sends RCMP Inspector Coswell and the newly promoted Sergeant Blakemore to the rugged district of West Cariboo in British Columbia, where a young Mountie constable has been found dead in his burnt-out cruiser at the bottom of a ravine. But what looks like an accident quickly reveals itself as a poorly disguised murder. With a young and ambitious Tribal Police intern as their unexpected ally, Coswell and Blakemore&#39;s investigation takes them from cattle ranches and native reserves to forests high in the hills where logging operations and marijuana grow-ops exist side by side. And all the while, the case threatens to ignite racial conflicts that have been simmering in the region for more than a century.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;Praise for &lt;i&gt;Murder in the Chilcotin&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&quot;In a stirring climax comprised of white versus red, youth against elder, and tribal tradition against Canadian law, the grandeur of British Columbia&#39;s deep forests emerges as the lead character in this fascinating book.&quot;&lt;br&gt;~ Betty Webb, &lt;i&gt;Mystery Scene&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&quot;[Innes&#39;] story-telling prowess, captivating story line, and intriguing plot leave the reader at his mercy.&quot;&lt;br&gt;~ Sage Birchwater, &lt;i&gt;BC Studies&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />
