  <title>The Cold Truth - Jonathan Stone</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Female NYPD trainee Julian Palmer has come to a frigid corner of Upstate New York to work alongside legendary police chief Winston &quot;Bear&quot; Edwards-to help solve the brutal murder of a young waitress, and perhaps learn a thing or two along the way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Julian knows that Edwards, an Old School cop if there ever were one, isn&#39;t happy about a female rookie assisting him-or the strange local psychic they&#39;ve called in to help. Still, she&#39;s a bit in awe of the old Bear-he has, after all, solved every murder case he&#39;s ever worked on. Except this one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, as Julian and Edwards investigate, they are thrust into a labyrinthine mystery, where endless twists and turns keep the case as compelling as it is elusive. And as the snow continues to fall on rural New York, hiding everything beneath a glistening white blanket, it might also cover up the only thing that will solve this case: &lt;i&gt;The Cold Truth&lt;/i&gt;...&lt;/p&gt;" />
