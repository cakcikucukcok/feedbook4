  <title>Mrs. Hudson in the Ring: Third in the Mrs. Hudson of Baker Street series - Barry S. Brown</title>
      <meta name="description" content="When Sherlock Holmes is goaded into a boxing match, his opponent, Sailor Mackenzie, loses both the bout and his life. All are convinced Mackenzie&#39;s death was a ring accident. All, that is, except the residents of 221B Baker Street, and Inspector Lestrade who defies his Scotland Yard colleagues to aid in a murder investigation. In this, the third in the Mrs. Hudson of Baker Street series, Mrs. Hudson, the unheralded director of the consulting detective agency, leads her colleagues from London to McLellan Manor in Yorkshire as they sort through the numerous people who have reason to celebrate Mackenzie&#39;s death. Complicating their investigation, Holmes and Watson are asked to become Lillie Langtry&#39;s protectors, and Mrs. Hudson her lady&#39;s maid, when the famous beauty is threatened by her latest admirer, the volatile George Baird. All will become clear, but not before Holmes and Watson call on a ghost to solve a 35-year old murder, and Mrs. Hudson discovers she has more in common with Lillie Langtry than she ever expected. Includes Readers Guide." />
