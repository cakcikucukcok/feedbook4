  <title>Breaking Faith - Jo Bannister</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;When she called her business &quot;Looking for Something?&quot; Brodie Farrell hoped to receive challenging commissions from interesting clients.  Even by her standards, though, demon rock musician Jared Fry is hard to please.  Fortunately his manager, the charismatic Eric Chandos, is easier to like, and it&#39;s with him that Brodie works to find a new home for the rock star.&lt;br&gt;An old coaching inn on the Downs seems the perfect choice.  Though the locals are appalled---and their teenagers thrilled---at the arrival of the self-styled Satanist, Fry&#39;s primary concern is his new swimming pool.  And that&#39;s when he realizes that the protestors outside are the least of his problems.&lt;br&gt;Brodie&#39;s troubles are only just beginning, too.  She has a long-term relationship with gruff, hardworking Detective Superintendent Jack Deacon and an important platonic friendship with Daniel Hood, a quiet young teacher with hidden depths.  So why does she find herself so drawn to Chandos?  And how much is she going to risk before the real trouble starts?&lt;/p&gt;" />
