  <title>Toll Road - Donald L. Ball</title>
      <meta name="description" content="A kidnapping in a small town in California&#39;s Central Valley begins a series of events which forces Detective Jason Carmichael to brush aside standard investigative protocol.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Following conventional procedures would involve a candid dialog with the media. But because of a diabolically unique and unpredictable ransom demand, in which the police have no way of apprehending the kidnappers, Jason believes the result would be multiple &quot;copy cat&quot; events. The flip side is, by not keeping the public appraised of the potential danger; children would still be at risk. With either decision, Jason realizes he will be judged wrong.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Throughout this juggling act, nothing can override his biggest concern-what will happen when the kidnapper&#39;s leverage runs out?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
As Marie Gallagher and Jason stand side by side listening to tapes of tormenting phone calls from the abductors, she begins a back door entry into his empty private life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;I&gt;TOLL ROAD&lt;/I&gt; traces the multiple paths of an investigation, even resorting to an unwitting conspiracy between the least likely of sources.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Of all the cases Jason had worked on, he could never have imagined a clue as important as, &quot;Uh-huh.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;" />
