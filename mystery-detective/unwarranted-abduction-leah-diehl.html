  <title>Unwarranted Abduction - Leah Diehl</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;When Diane Montgomery, the First Lady of the State of Maryland, is kidnapped in front of her two young daughters, all other cases are put on hold, pulling the local police department, the FBI, and Homeland Security together as a cohesive team. Its a priority to find Diane and bring her home to her family. To make matters worse, people all around who are involved in the case are being found murdered as a warning to the investigators: the abductors mean business, and they will destroy anyone who crosses them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, Dianes sister, Anna Lentz, senses that Diane is still alive and will do anything to find her. Anna battles the furies of Mother Nature as Hurricane Kelsie bears down on the East Coastand Maryland goes into lockdown and issues a state of emergency. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It seems, however, that the answer to the mystery behind Dianes abduction may be closer than anyone can imagine. Gov. Kenneth Montgomery understands that pardoning someone from death row is nearly impossible, and he is torn between being a husband and a government official. Family comes first, but the states citizens count on him to provide safety and security. Has the State of Maryland put their trust in the wrong man?&lt;/p&gt;" />
