  <title>The Whole Art of Detection - Lyndsay Faye</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;Internationally bestselling author Lyndsay Faye was introduced to the Sherlock Holmes mysteries when she was ten years old and her dad suggested she read Sir Arthur Conan Doyle&amp;#8217;s short story &amp;#147;The Adventure of the Speckled Band.&amp;#8221; She immediately became enamored with tales of Holmes and his esteemed biographer Dr. John Watson, and later, began spinning these quintessential characters into her own works of fiction&amp;mdash;from her acclaimed debut novel, &lt;I&gt;Dust and Shadow&lt;/I&gt;, which pitted the famous detective against Jack the Ripper, to a series of short stories for the &lt;I&gt;Strand Magazine&lt;/I&gt;, whose predecessor published the very first Sherlock Holmes short story in 1891.&lt;br&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Faye&amp;#8217;s best Holmes tales, including two new works, are brought together in &lt;I&gt;The Whole Art of Detection&lt;/I&gt;, a stunning collection that spans Holmes&amp;#8217;s career, from self-taught young upstart to publicly lauded detective, both before and after his faked death over a Swiss waterfall in 1894. In &amp;#147;The Lowther Park Mystery,&amp;#8221; the unsociable Holmes is forced to attend a garden party at the request of his politician brother and improvises a bit of theater to foil a conspiracy against the government. &amp;#147;The Adventure of the Thames Tunnel&amp;#8221; brings Holmes&amp;#8217;s attention to the baffling murder of a jewel thief in the middle of an underground railway passage. With Holmes and Watson encountering all manner of ungrateful relatives, phony psychologists, wronged wives, plaid-garbed villains, and even a peculiar species of deadly red leech, &lt;I&gt;The Whole Art of Detection&lt;/I&gt; is a must-read for Sherlockians and any fan of historical crime fiction with a modern sensibility. &lt;/div&gt;" />
