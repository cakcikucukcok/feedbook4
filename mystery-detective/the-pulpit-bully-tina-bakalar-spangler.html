  <title>The Pulpit Bully - Tina Bakalar Spangler</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Shots ring out in the sanctuary of Littletons True Liberal Church, and in the end two people are shot. Congregants and friends of the church are plunged into despair as a beloved member is killed. Witnesses point fingers, but are they pointed in the right direction?&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Local TV anchor Kelly Allen, on the edge of a broken relationship at thirty-seven, is at a turning point in her life. Frustrated by the current tawdry state of the news in the age of electronic journalism, she is determined to deepen the publics understanding beyond sound bytes and incessant speculation. As she digs deeper into the church shooting, Allen encounters blatant deception, unquestioning allegiance, and a myriad of conflicting viewpoints disguised as truth. She is driven to claw her way out of the muddy realm of human misbehavior to unravel the puzzle.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Allen unexpectedly finds renewed passion in her work and life. In her quest, she winds up unearthing the truth on many levels.&lt;/p&gt;" />
