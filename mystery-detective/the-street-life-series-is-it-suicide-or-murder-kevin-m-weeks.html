&lt;center&gt; &lt;b&gt; Book Review &lt;/b&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;
&quot;The Street Life Series: Is It Suicide or Murder? is a very strong debut novel in the urban fiction genre. The plot was engaging, and the pacing was well suited to a novel of this type. The dialogue came off as very convincing, and did a good job propelling the story. The author (Kevin M. Weeks) has a very accessible prose style, which makes the book just plain fun to read. Weeks successfully conveys a sense of realism necessary for a convincing genre novel, through both dialogue and narrative. He excels at combining dialogue and descriptive passages, and keeps the story moving along nicely. The novel will be enjoyable to a wide audience.&quot;
