  <title>The Unveiling - S. C. Guardian</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;When her brother was tragically killed years ago, S. C. was angry, vengeful, sad, and confused. She loved her older brother dearly, and set out to find answers about his death. She started writing to heal herself, and the writing led her to new understandings. In addition to the writing, she began seeking answers. This is how Unveiling was born.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unveiling is based on S. C.&#39;s real life experiences as she searched for answers about her brother. In the Unveiling, Champion, the brother, is the main character and his younger little sister, Seeker, is out looking for answers about why he died. When she starts to uncover the truth about her brother&#39;s death, she is awakened to a whole new understanding of life, and she learns secrets to living her own life well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More than 20 years in the making, Unveiling started as a painful tragedy, but developed into a gift when Seeker  much like S. C. in real life  discovered the gift her brother gave in his death.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;The purpose of this book, Unveiling, is to share what Ive learned from this experience,&quot; S. C. explains. &quot;My brother&#39;s passing was a deep gift because it triggered in me a Spiritual journey, as a result of the gifts he showed me. Life is different when you live from a totally different Spiritual perspective. Life has become easier for me because I now have the tools and understanding of how to be in the world, but not of it.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;" />
