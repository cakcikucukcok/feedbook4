In this remote outpost in the French Zone of occupation in the southwest corner of Germany, the beer is good, the duty is mostly boring, and the only problem the GIs stationed there have is trying to decide which gasthaus they want to go to tonight. However, when the 7424th Support Squadron starts remodeling and restructuring the Air Force communication facilities at the nearby Birkenfeld Tactical Air Base their world is about to be changed forever. Almost as soon as construction is started, rumors start spreading that what is advertised as just an upgrade to the existing facilities is in reality the installation of a top secret communications facility. As a result, Russian KGB and East German Stasi agents are sent to investigate. When Washington responds by sending agents of their own, Neubrucke, and the American GIs that are stationed here are about to enter the Cold War." />
