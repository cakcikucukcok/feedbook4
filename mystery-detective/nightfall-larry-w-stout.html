  <title>Nightfall - Larry W. Stout</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Who is Tyler Jackson?  The question that was explored in the Hourglass continues in Nightfall.  In the year 1967, a teenager from a small town in central Pennsylvania has written a science fair project that baffles the experts.  Tyler Jackson, a boy who appears to have become a genius overnight, arouses the interest of the FBI as well as an organized global force of evil that is invisible but tangible. So begins a forty-year journey, as Tyler seeks to stay one step ahead of his pursuers, traveling to every continent on the globe.  Jackson recognizes some divine intervention in his quixotic travels as he finds himself at Westminster Seminary where he meets Professor Cornelius Van Til, to LAbri, Switzerland where he encounters Francis Schaeffer, and in Allenwood Prison he is counseled by Chuck Colson.  The loner has one friend, an FBI agent named Eric Wallenberg, who forms a strange alliance with Jackson that ultimately brings them together in a dramatic climax that nearly ends both their lives.  A philosophical adventure drama that never stops." />
