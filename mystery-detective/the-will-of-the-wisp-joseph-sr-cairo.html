  <title>The Will Of The Wisp - Joseph Sr. Cairo</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Eight years ago, Robbie Stallings, an eleven-year old Asperger child, was abducted by an unidentified assailant while riding his bicycle home with his brothers along a stretch of deserted road near his home in Dickenson, North Dakota. His mother, claiming to have a psychic link with the boy, seeks the help of Rick Mallory, a high profile detective whose exploits have been sensationalized in the New York Herald Gazette by the famous crime reporter Moe Berg. Mallory takes the case, but where does he start to look for clues eight years after the fact? He retains a vague recollection of the  young reporter who covered the case on television. It was none other than Melissa Compton, the anchor of the top-rated television news magazine Tunnel Vision. The book opens with Mallory visiting her at 30 Rock. The sexual tension between the protagonists is craftily woven into a mystery that leads them across the country, from New York to Montana, and ultimately into each other&amp;#39;s arms." />
