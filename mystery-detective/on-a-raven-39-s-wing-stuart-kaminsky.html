      <meta name="description" content="&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Twenty contemporary writers commemorate the 200th anniversary of the birth of Edgar Allan Poe with chilling stories inspired by the master himself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nearly two centuries after they were penned, Edgar Allan Poe&#39;s macabre tales are still working their eerie magic on readers of every stripe&amp;#8212;thrill-seekers, filmmakers, even fellow writers of suspense. Collected here to honor and celebrate Poe&#39;s genius are original stories by some of the best mystery writers at work today.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A son attempts to connect with his dying father in Thomas H.
