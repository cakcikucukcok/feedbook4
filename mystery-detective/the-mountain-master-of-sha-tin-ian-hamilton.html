  <title>The Mountain Master of Sha Tin - Ian Hamilton</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Ava is in Shanghai with Pang Fai to visit her ailing friend Xu when a triad war breaks out in Hong Kong. Sammy Wing, an old enemy of Ava&amp;#8217;s who has twice tried to kill her, has enlisted the aid of his nephew Carter &amp;#8212; the new Mountain Master of Sha Tin &amp;#8212; to reclaim control of his old territory, Wanchai, from Xu&amp;#8217;s men.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is nothing subtle about the Wings&amp;#8217; methods. Xu&amp;#8217;s most trusted enforcer, Lop, has been shot, and six of his street soldiers kidnapped. The Wings threaten to execute them unless Xu&amp;#8217;s men vacate Wanchai immediately. Ava steps in to broker a settlement, and the Wings respond by sending her a box containing six fingers &amp;#8212; and a twelve-hour deadline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the violence and tension mount, Ava is driven to the edge, and she is forced to devise a plan that will bring her face-to-face with Sammy and Carter Wing. The only question left unanswered is who will pull the trigger first?&lt;/p&gt;" />
