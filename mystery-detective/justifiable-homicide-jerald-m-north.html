  <title>Justifiable Homicide - Jerald M. North</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Detective Ben Miller, and his new associate Gail Hopkins, of homicide are called in to investigate the murder of a real estate agent. She was found beaten to death in a home in which she had an appointment to show. The obvious suspect was her client but he is quickly ruled out by Miller since he had no actual motive. He also had what appeared to be a solid alibi for his whereabouts during the time of the murder.
	 Shockingly, soon after Miller and Gail begin their investigation another agent is found massacred in another home listed by the same Realtor. Miller now senses that the murderer is somehow connected to the real estate office where both agents worked. As such, he concentrates his efforts on interviewing the co-workers of the two slain agents, while sending his associate out to do the grunt work, that he doesnt have the time or energy for. In doing so, although he desperately needs her help, his ulterior motive was to keep his inexperienced associate as far away from any real danger as possible. 
	Unfortunately though, while Miller is closing in on a possible suspect, he receives word that his associate has been taken hostage by the real murderer who threatens to let her die unless Miller follows all his demands to the letter. Suddenly, Miller is on a pursuit that takes him all the way to Rome and will change his life forever. Will he be able to save her life or will he go to his grave marked as an accomplice to her death? With only forty-eight hours to save her his chances are slim to none." />
