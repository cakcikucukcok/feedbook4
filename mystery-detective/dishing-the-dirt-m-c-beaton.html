  <title>Dishing the Dirt - M. C. Beaton</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Dishing the Dirt&lt;/i&gt; continues the tradition in M. C. Beaton&#39;s beloved Agatha Raisin mystery series--now a hit show on Acorn TV and public television.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When therapist Jill Davent moved to the village of Carsely, Agatha Raisin was not a fan. Not only was this therapist romancing Agatha&#39;s ex-husband but she dug up details of Agatha&#39;s not-too-glamorous origins.  Jill also counsels a woman, Gwen Simple, that Agatha firmly believes assisted her son in some grisly murders, although there is no proof. Not one to keep her feelings to herself, Agatha tells anyone that would listen that Jill is a charlatan and better off dead. Agatha could only sigh with relief when the therapist took an office in Mircester.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Agatha learns that Jill had hired a private detective to investigate her background, she barges into Jill&#39;s office and gives her a piece of her mind, yelling &quot;I could kill you!&quot; So when Jill is found strangled to death in her office two days later, Agatha becomes the prime suspect. But Agatha, along with her team of private detectives, is determined to prove her innocence and find the real culprit. This time Agatha must use her skills to save her own skin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With &lt;i&gt;Dishing the Dirt, &lt;/i&gt;MC Beaton proves that &quot;once you meet Agatha Raisin, you&#39;ll keep coming back.&quot;(&lt;i&gt;New York Journal of Books)&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />
