  <title>A Widow&#39;s Curse - Phillip Depoy</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Fever Devilin, a folklorist by inclination and training, was born and raised amongst the hill-country folk of the Georgia Appalachians and it was there that he returned once he decided to leave academia.  And he&#39;s the perfect person to turn to when the owner of a mysterious medallion, one with some connection to the area, wants to uncover the provenance of the piece.  On the surface, it sounds simple enough but in Fever&#39;s life, nothing is ever simple.  Especially when the medallion&#39;s owner is found dead, murdered, in Fever&#39;s own house and the papers of Fever&#39;s late grandfather, of no intrinsic value, are stolen. And Fever himself in the prime suspect in the murder.&lt;br&gt;      The only clue to the truth behind these confusing events is the medallion itself, which is somehow tied to Fever&#39;s secretive family&#39;s history. With someone trying to frame him for the murder and other hidden forces hot on the trail of the medallion itself, Fever is wedged tightly between the proverbial &#39;rock&#39; and equally proverbial &#39;hard place.&#39; And the only possible way out is buried within the uncomfortable hidden truths about his own family that Fever has spent years trying to avoid.&lt;/p&gt;" />
