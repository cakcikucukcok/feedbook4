  <title>Shadows in Summerland - Adrian Van Young</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Boston, 1859. A nation on the brink of war.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Confidence men prowl the streets for fresh marks. Mediums swindle the newly bereaved. Into this world of illusion and intrigue comes William Mumler, a manipulating mastermind and criminal jeweler. Mumler hopes to make his fortune by photographing spirits for Boston&#39;s elite. The key to his venture: a shy girl named Hannah who sees and manifests the dead and washes up on Boston&#39;s harbor along with her strange, intense mother, Claudette.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As Mumler and Hannah&#39;s fame grows throughout Boston, everybody wants a piece: Bill Christian, a brothel tough; Algernon Child, a drunken rival; Fanny A. Conant, a sly suffragette; and William Guay, a religious fanatic. These rogues among a host of others, including the great spirit rapper Kate Fox, form powerful bonds with the spirit photographers, one of which will end in murder. Mumler&#39;s first and last mistake: the dead cannot be made to heel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Roughly based on the real-life story of William H. Mumler, spirit photographer and his clairvoyant wife, Hannah Mumler, Shadows in Summerland immerses the reader in a shifting world of light and shade where nothing is quite what it seems at first glance. A soaring and resplendently Gothic novel spanning three decades, it is as much an homage to the Golden Age ghost stories of Edith Wharton and Henry James as it is a companion to the revisionist historical epics of Peter Carey and Sarah Waters, with a little steampunk all its own. &lt;/p&gt;" />
