  <title>The Green Revolution - Ralph McInerny</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Any year when the Fighting Irish don&#39;t go undefeated is a disappointment, but to turn in a losing football season is unheard of. This year the faithful are refusing to admit defeat even as the losses start to pile up. With the students in a funk and the alumni in an uproar, something must be done, or more precisely, somebody has to go. Since they can&#39;t expel the team, they&#39;ll have to settle for firing the multimillion-dollar head coach---but will a new coach satisfy everyone?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are some---namely faculty members with a distaste for university athletics---who see this as their chance to refocus the school on academics. When the battle between Notre Dame&#39;s academic and athletic traditions turns deadly, however, Roger Knight, professor of Catholic Studies, becomes a marked man.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Accustomed to working together, Roger and his P.I. brother Philip will have to go their separate ways in Ralph McInerny&#39;s delightful &lt;i&gt;The Green Revolution&lt;/i&gt; to unravel a campus-wide conspiracy and put the Irish back on top.&lt;/p&gt;" />
