  <title>Dead in the Doorway - Diane Kelly</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Dead in the Doorway&lt;/i&gt; is the second in a delightful cozy series from Diane Kelly set in Nashville--where the real estate market is to die for.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;A HOUSE WITH GOOD BONES. . .&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whitney Whitaker has scored the perfect piece of real estate: a ramshackle white Colonial at the top of a hill with views of downtown Nashville. What more could a self-taught home-improvement maven and occasional house-flipper ask for? Ideally, the property of Whitney&#39;s dreams would &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; have come with a dead body blocking the entrance to the foyer. But Whitney, always quick to take heavy-duty matters into her own hands, also happens to be a skilled amateur sleuth. So that helps.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;AND SKELETONS IN THE CLOSET.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Who is this older woman--and how did her corpse end up at the bottom of the staircase of this locked, unoccupied house? That is what Whitney, along with the support of her wood-working cousin Buck, Detective Collin Flynn, and, of course, feline partner-in-crime Sawdust, intends to find out. Her friendly-neighbor investigation takes a sharp turn, however, when Whitney discovers that the house&#39;s former owner was a gourmet baker whose secret recipe for peach pie was to die for--perhaps literally. Now it&#39;s up to Whitney to learn the truth about what happened before she loses this killer real-estate deal . . . and the killer comes knocking at her door.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&quot;Adorable...Whitney and Sawdust are a welcome addition to your home and bookshelf.&quot;--Kellye Garrett, Anthony, Agatha, and Lefty Award--winning author of the Hollywood Homicide series &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />
