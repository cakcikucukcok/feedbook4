  <title>Death At Wentwater Court - Carola Dunn</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;In a series debut from Carola Dunn that is sure to delight fans of the classic British cozy mystery, &lt;i&gt;Death at Wentwater Court&lt;/i&gt; brings readers old and new back to the &quot;golden age&quot; of mystery. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It&#39;s the early 1920s in England--the country is still recovering from the Great War &lt;i&gt;and &lt;/i&gt;undergoing rapid social changes that many are not quite ready to accept.  During this heady and tumultuous time, the Honorable Daisy Dalrymple, the daughter of a Viscount, makes a decision shocking to her class: rather than be supported by her relations, she will earn her own living as a writer.  Landing an assignment for &lt;i&gt;Town &amp; Country&lt;/i&gt; magazine for a series of articles on country manor houses, she travels to Wentwater Court in early January 1923 to begin research on her first piece.  But all is not well there when she arrives.  Lord Wentwater&#39;s young wife has become the center of a storm of jealousy, animosity, and, possibly, some not-unwanted amorous attention, which has disrupted the peace of the bucolic country household.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Still, this is as nothing compared to the trouble that ensues when one of the holiday guests drowns in a tragic early-morning skating accident.  Especially when Daisy discovers that his death was no accident....&lt;/p&gt;" />
