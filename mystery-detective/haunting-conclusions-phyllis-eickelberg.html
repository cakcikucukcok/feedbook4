Heather and her sisters have inherited a letter and a package full of cards from their recently deceased mother.

&lt;p&gt;Heather also discovers a scrapbook with a collection of obituaries and details of a murder trial in her mothers things, further deepening the puzzle. Does it have something to do with one of their fathers former clients? After all, as a witness, he helped put away some pretty hardened criminals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Heather dives deeper into the mystery, the danger becomes all too real. Events in Heathers neighborhooda burglarized home, a mysterious neighbor, and her sisters near-fatal run-in with a carare seemingly unrelated to solving the riddle of her parents past. But it soon becomes all too clear that nothing is as it seems.&lt;/p&gt;" />
