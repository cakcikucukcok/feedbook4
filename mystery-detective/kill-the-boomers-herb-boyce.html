  <title>Kill the Boomers - Herb Boyce</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Medicare and Social Security are in trouble, and no one can agree on how to fund it, manage it, or control it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thats what certain elements within the United States government want people to believe. But in the secret back rooms of power, a diabolical plan has been hatched. These hushed negotiations propose a true fix to the Medicare and Social Security cash crunch: kill thirty million baby boomers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Their plan is all the more insidious for its methodology; the deaths will be masked as the unfortunate cost of a terrible act of nature. In Project Bluebird, the CIA developed a man-made avian flu to be used against terrorist cells plotting attacks against the United States. Once it was ready for use, however, the government deemed it too draconian, and the entire project was buried.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, years later, Project Bluebird has been reborn and repurposed. The powerful and ambitious sociopath behind the plan, White House Chief of Staff Carrington B. Massengale III, intends to use it to rid the US of baby boomers while catapulting himself into highest office in the land. Much to his consternation, Cynthia Wood, the nations first female president, stands firmly in his way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Only two men outside this inner circle know of the plot, and now they are running for their lives. They must do everything they can to stay ahead of the government assassins and share the evidence before its too late.&lt;/p&gt;" />
