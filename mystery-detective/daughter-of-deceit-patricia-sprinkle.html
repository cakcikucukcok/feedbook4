  <title>Daughter of Deceit - Patricia Sprinkle</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Katharine Murray&#39;s elegant Atlanta home has been viciously vandalized! She&#39;s prepared to devote all her time to getting it back in tip-top shape&amp;#8212;until she meets Bara Weidenauer. Once a picture-perfect socialite, Bara has fallen on some hard times. Her husband, Foley, has hightailed it out of their marriage, and she&#39;s convinced he&#39;ll try to take her for every penny she&#39;s got. While scouring her house for anything of value to hide from her greedy ex, Bara finds a box of military medals that once belonged to her father, a beloved war hero. Eager to know the story behind these precious trinkets, she enlists Katharine&#39;s help.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But as Katharine digs deeper into Weidenauer family history, she discovers that everything Bara believed about her father may have been a lie. And when Foley is found shot to death, Bara&#39;s world turns to complete chaos. It&#39;s up to Katharine to expose this family&#39;s secrets from the past &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; the present . . . or the future will be very grim indeed.&lt;/p&gt;" />
