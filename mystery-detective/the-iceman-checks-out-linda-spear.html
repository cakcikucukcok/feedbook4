  <title>The Iceman Checks Out - Linda Spear</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The newest vice president at Clearview Chemicals has been given the sole mission of downsizing the corporate departments, a task he relishes but one he will never get the chance to complete. R. B. Swaine, soon nicknamed Really Big Swine, demoralizes his employees within days of his arrival, and his meetings are bloodbaths of firings, with threats of far more. When his brutal murder is discovered, the news brings out jubilant responses from every employee. Until Swaine&amp;#39;s death, everyone involved feared for their jobs and their income, but now, with a death in their midst and police investigating their friends and coworkers, they are terrified for their very lives. The murderer could be any one of the employees who feared the new vice president&amp;#39;s fury. It could be the Krimpet-loving communications manager Lydia Barrett, who definitely has a secret to hide. Or it could be Cal Ferguson, the local director of health, who admits to being on site the night of the murder. Within twenty-four hours, another murder takes place. Are these two crimes connected? Are there two murderers? Could someone, some trusted colleague, kill and kill again?&lt;/p&gt;" />
