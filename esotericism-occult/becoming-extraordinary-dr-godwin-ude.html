  <title>Becoming Extraordinary - Dr. Godwin Ude</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The word &lt;i&gt;proactive&lt;/i&gt; means more than merely taking initiative; it means that as human beings we are responsible and accountable for the way we live our lives. Our behavior is a function of our decisions, not our conditions. We can subordinate feelings to values. We have the initiative and the responsibility to make things happen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More so, becoming extraordinary is a challenge to become responsible. Responsibility simply means response-abilitythe ability to choose your response. Highly proactive people recognize that in being responsible, they do not blame circumstances, conditions, or conditioning for their behavior. Their behavior is a product of their own conscious choices, made based on values.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Humans are wired with the ability to become proactive and responsible. Therefore, if conditioning has made us subject to forces and feelings that tend to ruin our lives, it is because we have, by conscious decision or by default, chosen to empower those things to control us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you feel that youve become passive, reactive, or reclusive, perhaps its time to free yourself through the power of conscious decision making. Become proactive, carry your weather with you, and become extraordinary!&lt;/p&gt;" />
