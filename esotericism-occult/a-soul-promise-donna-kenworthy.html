  <title>A Soul Promise - Donna Kenworthy</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;B&gt;Donna Kenworthy&#39;s&lt;/B&gt; first book, &lt;I&gt;A 1?900 PSYCHIC SPEAKS&lt;/I&gt;, told of her experiences working as a professional psychic. Her memoir, &lt;I&gt;A SOUL PROMISE&lt;/I&gt;, relates her lifelong spiritual quest. From her first mystical experience with the Divine Light as a young child, she felt a longing for her true home. Questions filled her mind that traditional answers and dogma could never satisfy. Ever the seeker rather than a follower, she allowed herself to remain open to esoteric teachings, personal supernatural occurrences, and inner knowing. In the late 1970&#39;s, her life changed dramatically when she had an out-of-body experience and returned in the company of a spirit guide. In the ensuing years, Ms. Kenworthy became a channel for her guide, who offered psychic as well as philosophical information. In 1986, shaken by having had foreknowledge of the nuclear accident at Chernobyl, she left behind her native California to seek the reason she had been given such remarkable information. In the midst of her quest, an astounding vision captures her soul. As she chronicles her personal spiritual journey, sharing her fears, doubts, and wonders, she continues to try to decode the mystery of a recurrent message, &quot;Now is the Time!&quot; It would take many years for her to discover that her earthly mission was to learn who and what we really are. In the end, she acknowledges that her younger self knew all along  We are not these physical beings, but spiritual beings whose true home is with God.&lt;/P&gt;" />
