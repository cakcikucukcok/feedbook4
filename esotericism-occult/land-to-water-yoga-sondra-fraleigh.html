  <title>Land to Water Yoga - Sondra Fraleigh</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Learn the five steps of land to water yoga: 
Standing and walking 
Kneeling and crawling 
Sitting 
Front lying 
Side lying and back floating 
While spending two months meditating and practicing yoga in silence at Sri Aurobindos first ashram in Baroda India, Sondra Fraleigh received her first inspirations about yoga based upon infant movement development and somatic principles. She consciously utilized this element in her creative use of yogabridging it with somatic movement education and intrinsic dancing.&lt;p&gt; 
This unique new form of yogaLand to Water Yogamaintains yogas original intent of spiritual healing and awareness and offers a way to deepen clear seeing and a calm mind, urging one past his or her limited ego. It is based on five stages of infant development and the methods of Shin Somatics Moving Way. Its progression moves backward from the most complex movement in terms of balance to the least: from walking to floating (from land to water), providing the opportunity to retrace our personal human development back to its watery soma source.&lt;p&gt; 
Progressing through these five primary stages may elicit surprising infant and childhood memories, which can heal trauma when one lets go of buried feelings. Peeling away social constructions via this innovative form of yoga, one can learn through curiosity and build skill with ease." />
