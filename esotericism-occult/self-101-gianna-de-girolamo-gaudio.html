  <title>Self 101 - Gianna de Girolamo-Gaudio</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Giannas book is an invitation to return to the heart and soul of our being in order to usher in what many of us believe will be the next great era; The evolution of collective human spirituality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;- Joan Adam, RN, BSN, PHN, Caritas coach and reconnective practitioner&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most people resign themselves to try and keep the world from changing or skink mentally instead. Not Gianna. Too keep-moving-forward. So remarkable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;- Gina Gianetto, CEO, CAMPdesign and Architecture&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gianna has stood out as one of the genuine bright lights of humanity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;- Rev. Michael Petrow, PhDc, associate pastor of House on the Rock Family Church&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your book is so wonderful  in meaningful content and writing style. You take the journey with your readers - so much truth and wisdom coming through and very well written.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;- Felice Willat, founder of Day Runner Life Management Systems and author of &lt;br /&gt;Womans Book of Changes&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are very good self-help books around; I read many of them myself when I still believed that with enough self-improvement we could find our best selves and change the world. Imagine my shock when my true Self found me. And no, they are not one and the same.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This book shares my discovery that what we know as our selves are actually our Personas, the invented selves we think we are. The Selfour true natureis the one we were born to become; it is our birthright, waiting within for us to discover.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For any reader who can suspend old expectations and preconceptions to take the journey offereda journey to your own availabilitysimultaneously and synergistically whole worlds begin to change, within, without, and for the good of all.&lt;/p&gt;" />
