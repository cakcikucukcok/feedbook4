Get savvy to the hidden agenda of your personality, and learn to sidestep its unconscious motives and unproductive directives. 
Become more aware of how you disconnect from the flow of Life and all its dimensions. 
Explore ways to resonate with the qualities of Presence, so you can be happier, calmer, and more fully present. 
Calm allows us to process our experience completely and helps us access the resources present within the well of our soul.  from Chapter 21
