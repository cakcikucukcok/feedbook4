  <title>What Did Jesus Really Say-How Christianity Went Astray - Peter Cayce</title>
      <meta name="description" content="No dogma please. And hold the mustard. For something to be called &lt;i&gt;Christ&lt;/i&gt;ianity, it should be based on the teachings of Jesus &lt;i&gt;Christ&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus never said he needed to die for our sins so we could be &quot;saved.&quot; Only Paul and John make this claim. Christianity has therefore become a form of Paulism and Johnism that emphasize the Savior aspect of Jesus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And Paul had never met Jesus or heard him teach while Jesus was alive, and John tells a story that&#39;s so different from the other disciples that we must seriously question him as a source.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Did you also know there are two different biblical stories about how Judas dies?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And Mary Magdalene wasn&#39;t a prostitute until the Pope made her one in the sixth century.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pope Urban II even made killing non-Christians acceptable in the eleventh century.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other subjects include ancient Buddhist records about Jesus traveling to India and studying Buddhism. Jesus may even have studied and practiced Kabbalah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Subsequently, &lt;i&gt;What Did Jesus Really Say&lt;/i&gt; is an easy to read introduction that also reflects on God, Karma, Buddhism, Kabbalah, Reincarnation, Politics, and even Astrophysics.&lt;/p&gt;" />
