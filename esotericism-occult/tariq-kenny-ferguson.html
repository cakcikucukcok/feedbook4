  <title>Tariq - Kenny Ferguson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;In many ways, Tariq Karim is an average teenager. Fourteen can a confusing age for a boy on the verge of becoming a man, as changes morph his body and mind into something even he doesnt recognize. Tariqs experience, however, is very different from his friends. Along with the many physical changes hes going through, hes also discovering that he has some strange, new abilitiesand hes got good reason to keep these abilities a secret.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He and his widowed mother are on the run, hiding from enemies he cant really understand or predict. Tariq and his mom have finally found what they hope is a safe haven in a small, quiet town. His mother has even found romance and a great new teaching job. Things seem to be settling down, but then Tariq starts getting premonitions and warnings that frighten him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One day, one such premonition impels him to stop his friends father from crossing the train tracks at precisely the right momentsaving his life. Tariqs secret is out, and his life will never be the same. So begins his fascinating and frightening journey to purpose. And suddenly, the quiet and anonymous life he and his mother were building come crashing to an end as their enemies find them again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For a young man who wants to find his place in the world, are these gifts a blessing or a curse?&lt;/p&gt;" />
