  <title>Living in the Psychic Realm - Kay Smith</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This is the true-life story through the eyes of eight-year-old Jethro, part Native American Indian, who is born with the psychic gift.  He is forced to realize that not everyone sees and hears what he sees and hears when his gift becomes heightened after a near-death experience.  It is humorous yet heartwarming as he attempts to reject the gift, then with the guidance and mentoring of his devout godmother learns to accept and embrace his potential to help others.
The battle between the light and dark energies is eye-opening to both believers and non-believers of the psychic realm.  The refreshing perspective of youth illuminates paradigms of traditional good vs. evil and clarifies common misconceptions of what it means to be psychic.  It is written in an easy-to-read, unpretentious style yet addresses eternal life-concepts.  
The book is a must-read for anyone who has ever felt &quot;different&quot; and an inspiration to develop ones own intuitive senses." />
