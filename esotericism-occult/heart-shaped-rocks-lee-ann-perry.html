  <title>Heart-Shaped Rocks - Lee Ann Perry</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;For more than twenty-five years, Lee Ann Perry has been counseling others out of anxiety and depression. When faced with the emotional trauma of the breakup of her own marriage, Lee began her ascent to happiness by reaffirming her fundamental belief that there is always a way to overcome adversity. Through the years, Lee observed that some people recover quickly from setbacks while others linger in pain. She resolved to be like the former, moreover, she was determined to discover the most direct path back to thriving.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over her lifetime, Lee has been a seeker of inspiration and enlightenment. Given her interest in spiritual evolution, her marriage ending was compelling evidence that something was off in the way she had interpreted and applied what she had come to believe. That disconnect impelled her to a rigorous examination of the evolution of her spiritual and philosophical pathwhich beliefs and practices had contributed to her overall happiness, and which had not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lee was convinced that both staying stuck and moving on were choices; she recognized that she did not have to be a victim of her circumstances. She sought an empowering alternative and tapped into profound happiness in the process. Her experience went far beyond confirming her belief that adversity can be turned into opportunity. She discovered that her capacity for happiness expanded with her self-awareness. People began to notice how joyful she was, and their eagerness to learn how to get similar results inspired her to write down the details of her process. This book recounts Lees journey from despair to elation in thoughtful, lucid, and sometimes amusing anecdotes. You can follow this unfolding and apply these insights to expand your own experience of happiness and well-being.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Insightful and inspiring. The heartfelt tale of a counselors journey from pain to self-acceptance and the transformational power of living a life of love.&lt;/p&gt;
