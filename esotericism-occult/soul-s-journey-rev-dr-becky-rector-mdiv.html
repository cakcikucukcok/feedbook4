      <meta name="description" content="Many people have asked themselves, What is my hearts desire? This question can be confusing. Perhaps you arrived at a point when you felt confident in what your hearts desire looked like. You may have even started making the choice to go after it, whatever it is, only to have something get in your way, maybe more than once. This barrier that always seems to pop up may have manifested as fear, either your own or that of a loved one, that pulled you away from your decision. This fear of the unknown may have forced you to stay in your current situation. No matter how this barrier manifested, it seemed to get in your way every time. 
Now, some people may believe this interference is a sign from the utmost. Or perhaps they believe that, by staying in their current situation, they will find a new happiness that will lead to contentment. So which is the true hearts desire? The answer is simple: Its the one that, when you see yourself obtaining it, gives you the most joy and happiness. Its the one that makes your heart race." />
