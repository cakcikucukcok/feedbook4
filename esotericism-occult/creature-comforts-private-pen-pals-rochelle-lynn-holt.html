  <title>Creature Comforts: Private Pen Pals - Rochelle Lynn Holt</title>
      <meta name="description" content="To understand the shifting emotions human beings go through daily, regarding any and all relationships to family, friends, lovers, acquaintances and strangers (ourselves included), each of us needs to continue to evolve and to become educated while living creatively in a stressful society and world.&lt;/br&gt;
My original purpose was to match a different animal and subject for every day of the year. As it turned out, some months have more entries than others; but, none is less than a month without Sundays and/or weekends.&lt;/br&gt;
Often, true benefit only takes place when the self who feels victimized expresses emotions on paper (i.e. in form of a missive to someone else) to comprehend whatever may be bothering the letter-writer.&lt;/br&gt;
But, these letters aren&#39;t intended to be sent; they are private. Instead, consider this volume a way and means to comfort and/or offer a solution or resolution to a troubling issue. For, only by appreciating ourselves can we totally fathom others before ultimately caring about humanity at-large, enough to accept and tolerate, eventually love each other&#39;s distinct uniqueness in this vast universe still striving for peace and harmony.&lt;/br&gt;
Writing letters has become a dying art. So too comprehending the significance of all creatures to balance our environment that is dependent on survival of on animals and insects. Perhaps you won&#39;t be able to resist sending one or two missives to the right or wrong person. That&#39;s up to you. I offer &lt;i&gt;Creature Comforts&lt;/i&gt;   with the genuine hope that you may realize every creature on earth has a purpose.&lt;/p&gt;
