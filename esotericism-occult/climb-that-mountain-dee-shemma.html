  <title>Climb That Mountain - Dee Shemma</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Climb That Mountain&lt;/i&gt; is a guidebook for your personal journey.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Are you lost, stuck, or off track?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What do synchronicity, the universe, angels and intuition have to do with you?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Would it be worth letting go of anger, hate, blame, fear and co-dependency?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Have you ever tried journaling, visualization, meditation, or saying affirmations?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Have you checked on your choices, plans, goals and dreams lately?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do you pay attention to your thoughts, listen in order to hear, take responsibility for your life, use your time wisely and refrain from judging others?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Did you know that you are a soul with a body, as opposed to a body with a soul?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Can you believe that you are never alone, that you have a support-circle and a trust-team?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How is your gratitude attitude?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Are you living in the now, or are you stuck in the past?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do you have healthy boundaries?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do you realize that there are no mistakes in life, only lessons?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Can you accept that someone else doesnt need to changeyou do?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do you know that we are here in Earth School to learn, heal and grow?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My life was once devoid of hope, direction, and joy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today my life is on track.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Climb That Mountain will gently guide you too!&lt;/p&gt;" />
