  <title>Healing Power: the Workbook - Philip Shapiro  Md  Mph</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;This workbook is a companion manual to Healing Power: Ten Steps to Pain Management and Spiritual Evolution, Revised, 2010. It is a pain management manual, but much more. It outlines a path of healing and recovery from beginning to mastery. It defines the importance of unconditional love in the healing process. Here you will find the wisdom of the sages, translated into universal methods we can use in healthcare. The model offers a host of techniques and tools designed to help healthcare professionals and consumers transform physical, mental, emotional, interpersonal, and spiritual suffering into peace, strength, and wisdom. It addresses the root causes of our suffering and offers corresponding deep healing solutions. You control depth, speed, and complexity. You can take it as far as you wish, all the way to liberation or enlightenment. Dr. Phil Shapiro&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;This work is a masterpiece and a must read for anyone wishing to transcend their suffering. It&#39;s all here. The reasons we suffer, and more importantly, the way out. This is a tried and true life changing work. Beautifully presented, Dr. Shapiro shares his wisdom, experience, and the tools necessary to liberate ourselves from suffering and live our lives in freedom. Corbett Monica, Founder Dual Diagnosis Anonymous &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;If we receive our medication, surgery, or natural remedy and are still in pain, there are a variety of psycho social and spiritual methods that can help us manage that pain skillfully. To this end, Dr. Phil Shapiro created Healing Power, a self-help, self-healing model for healthcare professionals, patients, and consumers. Healing Power has fifteen methods, one hundred qualities, wisdom pearls, and a variety of religious traction devicesthe best of the best, a highlight reel of sortsextracted from great spiritual books, teachers, and masters and translated into spiritually-oriented, cognitive behavioral therapy, mindfulness, and contemplative practices. These are your choices. You can go as far as you wish using this cafeteria of options for deeper healing. 
Dr. Shapiro&#39;s model lights a fire of hope and possibility under traditional medical practice. It allows us to function under the umbrella of a great idea: bringing the wisdom of the sages to health care and the street. It spiritualizes the practice of medicine by infusing it with a story and a soul. It improves healthcare outcomes. Healing Power&#39;s contribution to medical practice and mind-body-spirit medicine is unique and powerful. I highly recommend this work. 
Dr. John Bischof, Psychiatric Medical Director, Central City Concern, Old Town Recovery Center &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;The thing I really enjoy about this workbook is no matter the page we read, it is about love, manifested in many forms. Kealy Slaughter, Peer Support Specialist&lt;/P&gt;" />
