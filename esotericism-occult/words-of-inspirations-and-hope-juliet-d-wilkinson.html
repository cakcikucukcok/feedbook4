  <title>Words of Inspirations and Hope - Juliet D Wilkinson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The religion that feeds and fosters all religions and emphasizes their common greatness.
-Sathya Sai Baba
Discipline of the mind is a basic ingredient of genuine morality and, therefore, of spiritual strength. Spiritual power is the eternal guide in this life and the life after, for man ranks supreme among all creatures. Led forward by spiritual power, man can reach the summit destined for him by the great creator. Since nobody can interfere in the realm of God, we should tolerate and live side by side with those of other faiths. In the mystic traditions of different religions, we have a remarkable unity of spirit. Whatever religion they profess, they are spiritual kinsmen. While the different religions in their historic forms bind us to limited groups and militate against the development of loyalty to the world community, the mystics have already stood for the fellowship of humanity in harmony with the spirit of the mystics of ages gone by. No one should question the faith of others, for no human being can judge the ways of God. This is an excerpt from the speech on spiritual progress.
