  <title>A Matter of Recovery - Wes Skillings</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;In the summer of 1994, C.B. Miller was a bright-eyed, quick-witted twenty-one-year-old with his entire life ahead of him. He was about to start his junior year of college, and he was keenly focused on realizing his dream of becoming a high school teacher and coach. As C.B. was educating himself to start a career, his father, Mike, was preparing to retire from one. With the last of his four children nearing the end of school, Mike intended to exit from the work force, anticipating more free time to travel with his wife, Sharon. Each with plans of their own, father and son both eagerly awaited their futures. As chronicled in A Matter of Recovery, all of that would change in an instant one fateful night. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Matter of Recovery: The Story of C.B. Miller follows C.B., Mike, their family, and a community of friends through a challenging journey, one that begins with sheer survival and ends with hard-won success. By sharing their experiences with others, the Millers hope to not only inspire but also to inform. Millions of traumatic brain injury survivors face daily challenges. Many of them along with their loved ones do not know how to advocate for themselves as they encounter systems that are ill-equipped and people who are misinformed when it comes to dealing with TBI. If A Matter of Recovery helps just one person tackle the difficult tasks involved in making their own way, the Millers believe it will serve its purpose.&lt;/p&gt;" />
