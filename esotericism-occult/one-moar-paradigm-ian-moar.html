  <title>One Moar Paradigm - Ian Moar</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;In a vibrant exchange of letters between the author and a University Psychology Major over a three year period, issues of social pressure, the human soul and the metaphysical underpinnings of life are explored and discussed. An interesting and revealing read for anyone whos sincerely in touch with, and sensitive to, the yearnings of their own, individual soul.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The author gets his first chance to present his understandings about the intentions of the universe and how it has been structured to reach its goals. In his opinion, all of the end-of-the-world-as-we-know-it scenarios were presently encountering are but the notification from the universe itself of a major paradigm shift in our reality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He presents all of his ideas in a clean and simple manner and formulates a unique understanding about life that wants to remain dogma-free. And it seems to work . . .&lt;/p&gt;" />
