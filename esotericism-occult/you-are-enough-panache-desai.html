  <title>You Are Enough - Panache Desai</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NATIONAL BESTSELLER&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A spiritual thought-leader and featured guest on Oprah&amp;#8217;s SuperSoul Sunday helps us learn to quiet fear and anxiety and discover the powerful wholeness that exists within us all in this inspiring and affirmative guide.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Achieving equilibrium in today&amp;#8217;s age of anxiety can seem like a near-impossible&amp;#8212;even frivolous&amp;#8212;task. Panache Desai offers a refreshing, surprisingly unusual approach to meet the challenges of the modern moment and heal the fractured self it produces.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For Desai, the soul&amp;#8212;whole, unbroken, at peace, and one with the life source&amp;#8212;isn&amp;#8217;t a destination. It already exists within each of us, just waiting to be revealed. It is not something we have to work to develop&amp;#8212;it is our birthright. And when we are in union with our soul, we experience a personal evolution that not only illuminates our individual cosmic purpose but helps us to engage the sense of purpose and presence necessary to remake the world itself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;You Are Enough&lt;/em&gt; offers a straightforward, non-judgmental, and approachable process of revealing the soul, of coming into alignment and harmony with our true selves. Combining personal narrative, clear and inspiring philosophy, and prescriptive practices, it reveals that the way through is the way in&amp;#8212;that the way through fear, self-doubt, and anxiety is accepting and embracing dissonance and emotional and psychological blockages, so that we can approach our lives and the world from a perspective that understands our fears are not who we are. Desai&amp;#8217;s goal is simple: to guide readers through radical self-acceptance toward a life of ultimate peace and fulfillment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beautifully designed, this enlightening volume by a fresh voice shows us that while life may have caused us to forget our power, potential, light, and love, they are always there, just waiting to be discovered.&lt;/p&gt;" />
