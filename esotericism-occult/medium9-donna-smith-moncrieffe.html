  <title>Medium9 - Donna Smith-Moncrieffe</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Humankind has always been in search of new ways to harness inner powers to ensure that our full potential can be reached. In &lt;i&gt;Medium9&lt;/i&gt;, Smith-Moncrieffe unlocks the secrets of consciousness by taking readers on a fascinating adventure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;	Experience the power of spiritual energy as ordinary people are reunited with loved ones who materialize and return from the spirit world to communicate during physical mediumship sances.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;	Learn about the extraordinary benefits each of us can achieve during out-of-body experiences and astral travel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;	Gain insight into the secrets of energy healing with authentic healers who manipulate energy to produce healing beyond the capabilities of traditional medicine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;	Examine how ordinary people learn about their past lives, subsequently change behaviors, and transform their lives through hypnosis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;	Gain insight into how extraterrestrial races facilitate instrumental transcommunication, energy healing and mediumship.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you enlighten yourself with this important knowledge, you can make stunning transformations in your life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Donna Smith-Moncrieffe continues gathering evidence for the afterlife, this time going where few have gone, into the world of dark sances. Using her finely honed critical skills she makes the reader aware that, far from having died out or being totally fraudulent, genuine physical mediumship still exists. She systematically describes the evidence she personally gathered in a series of paradigm shifting sances held in the United States. Ever the thorough researcher, she conducts fascinating follow-up interviews with witnesses and experts in the field. Her conclusions will stun you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Victor Zammit and Wendy Zammit, Co-authors of &lt;i&gt;A Lawyer Presents the Evidence for the Afterlife&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;The Friday Afterlife Report&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Medium9 explores the fascinating phenomena of physical mediumship from interviews with participants as well as from the viewpoint of the authors experience. For those readers who wish to understand the nature of our third dimensional reality as well as what lies beyond and how our world can interact with higher dimensional realities, Medium9 is a unique study of consciousness.&lt;/p&gt;
