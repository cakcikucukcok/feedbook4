  <title>Descent into Darkness - Marija Petrovic</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The title Descent into Darkness came to me several months before I started to work on the book. I felt inspired to write about a particular transition in my life at midlife. With several questions about my true purpose in life, my life path had come up. And I felt I needed to dive deep into unknown waters of emotion, desire, fear, and pain in order to find the answers. I had an intuitive sense that I was slightly off track and that something deep inside of me was not touched, and I felt something big missing in my life. I have decided to take the lid off and dive into the invisible, the unknown, and take the risks of either falling off the abyss or finding true freedom. I have found that writing has been my only way to stay sane in this process. And so I birthed this book." />
