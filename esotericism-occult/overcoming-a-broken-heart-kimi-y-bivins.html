  <title>Overcoming a Broken Heart - Kimi Y. Bivins</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;As a babe in Christ, author Kimi Y. Bivins experienced deep wounds that have taken years to heal. In Overcoming a Broken Heart, she narrates her journey of mending that broken heart throughout the years. She shows how she developed faith through wisdom and contemplation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this compilation of memoir, poetry, and reflections, Bivins addresses important issues of the church while at the same time providing insight into what its like raising a child on ones own. Overcoming a Broken Heart considers the importance of worship, the impact of relationships, the role of an active father in a childs life, the goal of working toward Gods purpose in our life, and the responsibility of the church to aid in forgiveness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Poetry, some of which was given to her by the Holy Spirit, offered her a way to overcome her broken heart. She hopes that her work can help others undergoing the same pain that she experienced.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With emotional depth, Bivins contemplates her life and those of the church, church leaders, and other Christians through Scripture, poetry, and prayer.&lt;/p&gt;" />
