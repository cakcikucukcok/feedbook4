  <title>A Healing Legend: Wisdom from the four directions - Garry Flint</title>
      <meta name="description" content="A Healing Legend: Wisdom from the four directions&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This little book teaches a healing process that can change your life.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A Healing Legend: Wisdom from the Four Directions was written for children and adults to teach the reader&amp;#39;s inner-self a treatment process to move him or her in a positive direction. This is accomplished by reading the story about Kidd.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Kidd is going through a tough time in his childhood: he&amp;#39;s being bullied in school and worries incessantly about the &amp;quot;what-ifs&amp;quot; in life to the point where it is disturbing his school work and social life.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Kidd receives wisdom from an unexpected source. This wisdom included a process that led to change in his problems without any effort on his part. His growth and transformation from an insecure boy to a self-confident being teaches us that change can happen with the right process.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In A Healing Legend: Wisdom from the Four Directions, authors Garry A. Flint and Jo C. Willems use a Native American allegory and communication techniques to teach readers of all ages an alternative way of healing personal issues. The fictional story of Kidd is a way to explore the truth that useful healing processes can pass between family and friends.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This book can be read to children and used in a school setting." />
