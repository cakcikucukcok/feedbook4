  <title>Make Challah and Call Me in the Morning - Beth Ricanati, Md</title>
      <meta name="description" content="KEY SELLING POINTS: 
• According to the Centers for Disease Control (CDC), 80% of common chronic diseases (heart disease, stroke, diabetes) are lifestyle-driven (nutrition, exercise, stress management). 
• Chronic disease treatments account for 75% of our nation’s healthcare costs, which are estimated to account for 20% of our GDP by 2024. That’s one in every five dollars for something that doesn’t need to happen in the first place. 
• Research published in the &lt;em&gt;American Journal of Public Health&lt;/em&gt; in 2016 demonstrated no change in the last 20 years in the number of women who took maternity leave. Notably, fewer than half of them were paid for it. It’s difficult to being a working—often-underpaid—woman in America today.
• According to data from Fertility of Women in the US, an estimated 43.5 million women between the ages of 15 and 50 who have children live in the US today—a huge target audience.
• According to the Pew Research Center, approximately 2 percent of American adults (5 million people) identify as Jewish.
AUDIENCE:
• Busy women, professional and non-professional, trying to balance work and home 
• Mothers, especially of young children 
• Jewish women" />
