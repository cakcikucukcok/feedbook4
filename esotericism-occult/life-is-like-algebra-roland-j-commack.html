  <title>Life Is Like Algebra - Roland J. Commack</title>
      <meta name="description" content="For anyone reading this book, I want you to know that in no way form or fashion is it professionally written since I am not a professional writer. In fact, this is my first book ever. What I hope you get out of this book is all me. In addition, a big part that comes along with me is my heart. 
You will find sections of this book written in elementary type words; words that every one of all ages who can read should be able to understand. It is also easy for those unable to read where someone else is reading it to them to comprehend and for those that English may not be their first, second, or maybe even third language. 
It is a very different, original, and unique book. I hope that all my readers enjoy my story. Thank you for taking the time to read it.
This book is about my life surrounded with Bible scriptures that tie into my life story. Throughout the chapters of this book, where I mention the sun of God, Jesus Christ, it is not an error or misspelling. I have intentionally spelled it this way. You will get a clearer understanding at the end of the book in the segment called I Believe." />
