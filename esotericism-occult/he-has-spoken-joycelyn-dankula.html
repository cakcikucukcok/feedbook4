  <title>He Has Spoken - Joycelyn Dankula</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This book amplifies and exemplifies what God has spoken that came to pass. It is to help you see God not in a new dimension but in his original dimensionthe one that speaks and comes to pass; the one that speaks and follows through; the covenant keeper, the unchanging changer. This book is to guide you methodically and carefully to listen to the Word of God, the promises of God and to see it, not only unfold in your personal life but to see it fulfilled, because once he has spoken, it will come to pass. That is why he says with emphasis and clarity, The grass withers, the flower fades: but the Word of our God shall stand forever.
Chapter one helps you to understand the legitimacy, the power, and the credibility in the Word of our God. Chapter two showcases and authenticates what God has done particularly through Abraham, Sarah, Isaac, and others. Chapter three is the icing on the cake, what God did for Ishmael, because of the value he puts on his Word and power and authority behind it. Chapter four shows how God speaks so that you can distill his promises for yourself. Chapter five details why God speaks. Chapter six is concerned with how you can benefit, maximize, and apply the Word of God to your life. Chapter seven is to help you sing Hallelujah over the situations of your life, when you can see that with God, all things are possible.
The purpose of this book is to encourage you to crave to hear the Word of God for your situation. Once God has spoken to your situation, consider it done. No matter how hopeless, helpless, disappointing, unexplainable, or discouraging the situation may be, whatever he has spoken shall come to pass." />
