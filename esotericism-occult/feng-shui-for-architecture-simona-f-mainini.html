  <title>Feng Shui for Architecture - Simona F. Mainini</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;b&gt;Feng Shui for Architecture&lt;/b&gt; is an easy-to-use manual to incorporate Scientific Feng Shui into the design, renovation, and decorating of your home. The final goal is to support your well-being, as well as your family&#39;s, in all aspects of life.  It is also particularly useful during a real estate pre-acquisition inspection, for it offers examples of bad Feng Shui (to avoid), good Feng Shui (to desire), and how to correct any overall problems.  This will help you to evaluate the kind of investment to be made and to make the property Feng Shui proof (as well as decide if you want to either buy it or pass on it).&lt;br&gt;
The only book on the market written by an architect, interior designer, and Feng Shui expert who has over 20 years of expertise in the fields of architectural planning, design, and Scientific Feng Shui Mastery, Feng Shui for Architecture is largely the result of answering frequent questions that have arisen over the years by concerned Feng Shui and Interior Architecture students in classes taught by the author as well as addressing common issues brought up by professional architects, designers, and clients with whom the author has consulted with during the development of hundreds of projects (and whom are also the same people who encouraged her to write this book). &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Editorial Reviews&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;i&gt;&quot;Dr. Simona Mainini has an astonishing ability to interpret and install ancient Chinese formulas in such a way that they change lives today. Her discipline and precision in a field not often distinguished by these qualities is both unique and world class.&quot; &lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Richard Ashworth&lt;br&gt;
Author of The Feng Shui Diaries &lt;br&gt;
Editor-in-Chief of The Journal of the Feng Shui Society&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;i&gt;&quot;Dr. Mainini is one of those few, wonderful people who have managed to weld together the strict disciplines of architectural practice with the aesthetics and philosophies of the ancient Chinese traditions of Feng Shui. Readers can be assured that what she writes is not founded just on theory alone, but sound, practical experience.&quot;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Derek Walters &lt;br&gt;
Author of The Feng Shui Handbook &amp; The Complete Guide to Chinese Astrology&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;i&gt;&quot;Feng Shui for Architecture is an excellent guide for both the Feng Shui professional and layperson. You can benefit from the knowledge presented here and use it to make your environment as harmonious as possible.&quot;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Larry Sang&lt;br&gt;
Author of The Principles of Feng Shui &lt;br&gt;
President &amp; Founder of The American Feng Shui Institute&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;i&gt;&quot;Feng Shui for Architecture has been extremely inspirational to me and many of my students at the School of Architecture and Urbanism at the University of Sao Paulo (Brazil). We are very impressed with Dr. Maininis knowledge and experience. She brings a new pattern to design and architecture.&quot;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Maria Cecilia Loschiavo dos Santos, PhD &lt;br&gt;
Author of Movel Moderno no Brasil &lt;br&gt;
Professor, Design Department, University of Sao Paulo, Brazil&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;i&gt;&quot;The title and subtitle promises a lot-- and this book delivers even more!  Dr. Mainini has done a fabulous job organizing and explaining-- in a clear, precise manner-- the principles of Feng Shui and the ancient Chinese art of placement for good energy flow as it applies to the spaces in which we live and work. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
     Not only is this book great for the preparation of buildings, it is also extremely useful even if you are only searching for an energetically superior apartment, house, or office space to rent.  If you are looking for an invaluable source of Feng Shui information to help bring harmony to your living and working space and your life, this is a book for you. I applaud Dr. Mainini for the publishing of this, her first book, and highly recommend it to those who want to learn more about this most fascinating modality of healing.
