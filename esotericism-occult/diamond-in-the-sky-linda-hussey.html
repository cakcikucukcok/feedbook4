  <title>Diamond in the Sky - Linda Hussey</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Why God?&lt;br /&gt;Everyone that I saw asked the same questions: Why God? Why has this happened to us? I wondered if we had done something really bad to bring Davids death upon us. I had always prayed to God for him to protect Dan and our children. I asked God to put a protective shield around them everywhere they went and to bring them back safely to me. I believed with all my heart that God would answer my prayers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Three months before Davids accident, I was sitting in the den talking with one of my son-in-laws about what I believed. He said Linda, death is realwe humans dont have any control over it. David was sitting in a recliner listening to us and he said, Mama, hes right; we dont ever know.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There was a big game going on in Heaven in honor of Christs birthday. They needed a catcher, so I got the Call, Come on son, come play in our Game today!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My dear family and friends remembered when those tears start to fill your eyes; just go outside and look up towards the stars for I will be playing on the Diamond in the sky!&lt;/p&gt;" />
