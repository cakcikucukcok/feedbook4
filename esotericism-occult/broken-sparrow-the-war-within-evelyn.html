  <title>Broken Sparrow (The War Within) - Evelyn</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Has someone ever hurt or treated you so badly that you had to beg God to help you to forgive them, and to take away the pain? Or did you ever love someone so much that everything in your life was turned and flipped upside down? Or maybe you wanted something so much, but it seemed too far out of your reach for you to even begin to think that it was possible? Life doesnt come with a book of Instructions, unfortunately. Well be the author of most of the people we allow into our lives, business or personal. It doesnt matter how good we try to be or if were religious enough or even faithful; there will come a time in everyones life when theyll have to cry, rich or poor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes well get dealt a hand in life that we cant win, but someone else can take that same hand and annihilate their opponents. Well, for Evelyn, that hand was dealt, and someone did take it and win. The unfortunate part is, she came from within. As a child, Evelyn developed multiple personality disorder. I cant begin to tell you about all of the hurt and pain she suffered at the hands of her alters and the people who claimed to love her.&lt;br /&gt;
