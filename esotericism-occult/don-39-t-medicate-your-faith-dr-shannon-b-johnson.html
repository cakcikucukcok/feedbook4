  <title>Don&#39;t Medicate Your Faith - Dr. Shannon B. Johnson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Have we medicated our faith? Have we replaced our faith in God with quick fixes? When we are sick, do we reach for the medicine only? Or do we also reach toward heaven to the One who made us? 
There has been a consistent increase in the amount of medications Americans are consuming over the past decades, and the numbers continue to increase. If faith increased at the rate that the intake of prescription drugs increased, miracles would become the norm, and healing would be an everyday occurrence. When Jesus was on the earth, faith in His ability to heal, out measured medications. Now we have more medicines than we have faith. The scales have tipped over. 
Jesus proposed this question to the disciples. Nevertheless when the Son of man cometh, shall he find faith on the earth? It seems that the worlds faith in God continues to diminish instead of growing. When the Lord returns to the earth, I pray that He will find faith in the earth. The Lord is not against His children seeking the help of physicians and medicines, but He also wants His children to seek His help and Dont medicate your faith!" />
