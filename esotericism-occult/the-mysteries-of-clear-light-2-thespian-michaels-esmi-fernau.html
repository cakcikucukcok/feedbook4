  <title>The Mysteries of Clear Light 2 - Thespian Michaels, Esmi Fernau</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The Mysteries of Clear Light, &quot;The Emerging Identity&quot; is the second trilogy in an open-ended series.
&lt;P&gt;
Consider this: what if everything you have ever been told about Spirit were incorrect; that in fact there is no attainment to reach for, no enlightenment to strive towards? What if, in your pursuit of Spiritual Truths, in your zest to embody some mystical ideals, you have lost the very path humanity was meant to follow?
&lt;P&gt;
At the heart of timelessness lies the wellspring from which true individuality derives. You are eternally in process of &quot;becoming&quot;, you are forever &quot;under construction&quot;; there are no established standards on which to base your earthly life.
&lt;P&gt;
Each of you is a Cosmos in miniature whose course cannot be determined by human standards. The very fact of seeking is an acknowledgment of lack, whereas just being as you are is a celebration of existence itself.. We the authors are not anything you cannot be. Neither prophets nor gurus, we simply relate the story we came to tell. Clearly written, never didactic, at times irreverent and funny, eternal yet new, the knowledge we share reflects the timeless love of the Entities who bring you this wisdom and gently remind you, the reader, of your true identity.
&lt;P&gt;
We do not teach, for in truth there is nothing to learn. The realizations and conclusions you reach are your own; we merely present you with a different viewpoint and show you alternatives. Your immortal spirit will help you make your optimal choices and direct you toward the purpose for which you incarnated. Your reward is not the enlightenment you have always had; it is the freedom to make full use of the powers within you." />
