  <title>The Labyrinth of Life - Stefanos S. Sifandos</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;This book represents a journey though the maze and mysteries of what life holds. Each aphorism conveys a deeper thought that may lead not only to exploration of self, but also a whole exploration of the world external to our own minds. The beauty lies within the realm of thought-provoking text. It is truly a beautiful experience if one has the ability to pause and reflect on the interconnectivity of what life presents. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our Western framework and culturally constructed clutter has occupied our lives to the point where the ability to contemplate deeper truths about our existence has become lost within mechanisms of unnecessary and forced survival. This book allows the individual to absorb deeper thought processes and realizations about the way in which the world operates. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Filled with stunning imagery, this collection takes the reader to a place within themselves where they may contemplate the beauty of this Earth, humanity and what truly is important to their own existence. It has been know for an age that deep contemplation may often lead to fulfilling and peaceful existence. May all those who feel and contemplate deeply that which they love be blessed with the strength, courage and will to better themselves and constantly strive for a peaceful state of being.&lt;/p&gt;
