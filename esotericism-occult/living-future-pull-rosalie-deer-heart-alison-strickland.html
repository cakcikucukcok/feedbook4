  <title>Living Future Pull - Rosalie Deer Heart, Alison Strickland</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Living Future Pull tells the story of one woman&amp;rsquo;s attempts to be normal and fit into the world she was raised to believe in until the accidental death of her nearly fourteen year old son shook her familiar world and other realities claimed her attention and gradually&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;transformed her consciousness. Her soul growth invited and sometimes demanded that she move out of her limited definition of who she was and what she was capable of becoming&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;and instead&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;open to and become a magnet for the frequencies of Future Pull&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Through reflecting on her journals&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;that spanned more than forty years, listening and taking action on her intuition, and learning to live her life through a multi-dimensional perspective, she broke rank with the limiting beliefs that kept her hostage to her ego and grounded her personal story. As she opened to the guidance of her guides&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;and angels and the frequencies of Future Pull, she aligned with her more expansive soul story that resonated with joy, health, creativity, healing, and service.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Living Future Pull&lt;/em&gt; was my personal response to the question I posed: What if our journey on earth is as simple as believing and trusting that each of us is the meeting point between earth and heaven? What if my life were as simple as believing that God is having a Rosalie experience here on earth through me?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Edge walking between my personal story and my soul story was laced with rebellion, love, discipline, surrender and courage. In the transformational process, I reclaimed my light and my truth. I delighted in becoming more present by responding to the question, who do I wish to become? and that Future Pull question became an organizing theme in Living Future Pull.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;" />
