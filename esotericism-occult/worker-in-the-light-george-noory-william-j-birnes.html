  <title>Worker in the Light - George Noory, William J. Birnes</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;George R. Noory is the host of America&#39;s top late-night radio talk show, &lt;i&gt;Coast to Coast AM&lt;/i&gt;, which is broadcast to more than 500 radio stations in the U.S. and Canada and streamed over the Internet to more than ten million people, five nights a week. Noory truly believes that there are forces, both good and evil, at work on Earth, forces that can be harnessed by human beings. Fueled by a transcending experience at a very young age, Noory turned his life into an investigation of the possibilities and influence of such forces, and how we can use them to enhance our lives. &lt;br&gt;Now George Noory has woven his life&#39;s work into both an amazing memoir and a miraculous key that readers can use to unlock the secret to their own sensual transcendence and liberate their limitless potential. Through &lt;i&gt;Worker in the Light&lt;/i&gt;, George Noory will show readers how to:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;*Unlock the secrets to unlimited spiritual growth&lt;br&gt;*Transcend all doubts and fears&lt;br&gt;*Shatter the prison walls of their five senses&lt;br&gt;*Deploy the power of intuition to see the future&lt;br&gt;*Free themselves from the confines of time&lt;br&gt;*Facilitate the power of lucid dreaming &lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;Through easily understood, step-by-step instructions, and examples from his own life, George Noory shows how he has surpassed his own limitations and frustrations, how he has freed himself from doubts and fears, and how he glimpsed the right way out of life&#39;s desperate straits. He will teach readers how to overcome fear and doubt and find happiness and success. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the Publisher&#39;s request, this title is being sold without Digital Rights Management Software (DRM) applied.&lt;/p&gt;" />
