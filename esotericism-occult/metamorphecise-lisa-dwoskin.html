  <title>Metamorphecise - Lisa Dwoskin</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;As a fellow University of Miami alumnus, I am a true believer in the power of the mind. All of my life I have been an athlete and believed in the balance of mind, body, and spirit. Without having all three in proper alignment, I would not have achieved what I have in my life. I often speak about maintaining a positive mindset, eating healthy, exercising, and balancing your life. I heard about Lisa and her book from my father, and was happy to read and learn more about her journey and her passion for and commitment to helping people live happier and healthier lives. I endorse this author, and I want to personally thank her for taking the time to share her story. I feel that Lisas journey will help awaken the lives of many, and inspire others to begin their own transformations. Sensational book and very uplifting!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Dwayne The Rock Johnson, actor, WWE&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lisa is a very close friend of mine, and she is the daughter that I never had. I enjoyed her book very much because I felt as if Lisa was speaking directly to me in a casual and relaxed manner, about self-love, healing, and spirituality. Her book took me on a journey of transformation. It gave me tools and exercises that I began practicing in my own life, and they worked. I was able to experience her journey and it helped me in my life to relieve stress through meditation and positive thinking. Life is not easy, but we all live and learn and continue doing so until the day we die. Lisa opened my eyes to see that it is not the challenges that we face in life that define us, but the way in which we proceed and deal with those challenges.&lt;/p&gt;
