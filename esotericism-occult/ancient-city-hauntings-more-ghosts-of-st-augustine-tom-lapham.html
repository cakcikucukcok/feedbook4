  <title>Ancient City Hauntings: More Ghosts of St. Augustine - Tom Lapham</title>
      <meta name="description" content="St. Augustine is America&#39;s oldest city-and perhaps its most haunted. David Lapham&#39;s first volume, Ghosts of St. Augustine, has proven very popular. Enjoy another twenty-five hair-raising stories from the ethereal shadows of the Ancient City&#39;s murky past. Why is St. Augustine so ghost-ridden, so filled with spirits? Since the release of Ghosts of St. Augustine, the Ancient City has been the subject of numerous television documentaries and paranormal investigations. Ghost tours have burgeoned. Few have been disappointed in their quests for supernatural experiences. Come walk again with Dave Lapham through the dark, enduring streets of St. Augustine and shiver in the ice-cold pockets of air that smother you in the black of night. Listen to the gentle lapping of the water along the bay front and the distant murmurs of French sailors being slaughtered on the river. Come visit the Oldest House, the Old Jail, Ripley&#39;s, the Oldest School House, and all the many haunted B&amp;Bs and other establishments that harbor wandering souls and spirits from ancient times. Chill to the ghosts you&#39;ll find in the Pumpkin Church, the Casa de La Paz and Casa de Suenos. Meet the warriors of Moultrie Creek, the ghost of the old Spanish Washer Woman, and the ghosts of the Minorcans. you&#39;ll encounter dogs and demons, herbal creations, and even ghost magnets." />
