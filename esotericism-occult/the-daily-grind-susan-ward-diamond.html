&lt;p align=&quot;left&quot;&gt;How do you begin your day? All of us have our daily rituals, which have a way of influencing&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align=&quot;left&quot;&gt;the rest of our day. In her book, The Daily Grind: GOD With Your Coffee, author&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align=&quot;left&quot;&gt;Susan Ward Diamond shares stories and reflections gleaned from years of praying and&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align=&quot;left&quot;&gt;meditating early each morning over a cup of coffee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align=&quot;left&quot;&gt;Begun as a personal spiritual discipline, Diamond began sharing her Thoughts for the&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align=&quot;left&quot;&gt;Day with her congregation by email. Before long, her meditations had made their way&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align=&quot;left&quot;&gt;around the globe, encouraging others on their life journey to experience Gods joyful,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align=&quot;left&quot;&gt;unconditional love each day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align=&quot;left&quot;&gt;Sometimes painful, sometimes humorous, always honest, you will find yourself in the&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align=&quot;left&quot;&gt;stories this pastor has to share. Story is the common thread that binds us to one another.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align=&quot;left&quot;&gt;As the great novelist Willa Cather said, There are only two or three human stories,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align=&quot;left&quot;&gt;and they go on repeating themselves as fiercely as if they had never happened before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align=&quot;left&quot;&gt;Life is difficultin fact, at times it can feel like a grind. But when God is invited into the&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align=&quot;left&quot;&gt;daily-ness of our lives, we begin to find a blend that is filled with a marvelous aroma!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align=&quot;left&quot;&gt;The Daily Grind: GOD with Your Coffee will be a great addition to your daywhatever&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;time of the day you choose to read it.&lt;/p&gt;
