  <title>Prayer Cover - Richard Roberts, Lindsay Roberts</title>
      <meta name="description" content="We may be living in times when fear, trouble, sickness, acts of terror and other bad news plagues people daily. But you don&amp;#39;t have to live in fear for your family&amp;#39;s life. You can pray according to the truth of God&amp;#39;s Word, which is powerful, life-changing, and greater than any troubles known to mankind. It&amp;#39;s strong enough to protect you and those you love from the hard times shaking our world. That&amp;#39;s what Prayer Cover is all about.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Based on prayers they pray over their own family, Richard and Lindsay Roberts share faith-building Scriptures focusing on God&amp;#39;s power, protection, rest, peace, healing, provision, love, and faith. They explain what these verses mean, and demonstrate how you can use these biblical truths during your prayer time. These scriptures can help you face every day with confidence and guide you in how to make a powerful, scriptural declaration of faith daily over your life and the lives of your loved ones.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Practical, easy to use, and encouraging&amp;ndash;Prayer Cover can teach you how to stand strong in your faith on what God&amp;#39;s Word says about the situations you&amp;#39;re facing. &lt;br&gt;" />
