  <title>Echoes of a Haunting - Clara M. Miller</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;In the first place, the house doesnt even look haunted. With these words, a different world opens up to readers as it did some twenty nine years ago for an unsuspecting family from Buffalo, New York. Echoes of a Haunting traces the steps of this normal family whose life turned upside down when they moved to a disturbed or haunted house in Southern New York State in 1970. It is told in diary form in order to bring a semblance of order to the events. At first, the family tended to discount the happenings and come up with some rather creative explanations. Soon, however, the explanations began more and more to assume the form of rationalizations. Before long, they were forced to admit that there was no natural cause for what was occurring daily both in the house and in the surrounding area. Reluctantly, the members of the family began to reach out to others. In some cases, they encountered scorn and even a strange, unwarranted, hostility as though the whole panoply of phenomena were their fault. It was a very bad atmosphere in which to raise a family. &lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;	Once the story became public, help was offered by psychics and clergy. In some cases this help even brought a temporary relief but the trouble never disappeared for long. Strange accidents, one almost fatal, happened on a regular basis. Figures were seen, both human and otherwise. In one case a house was seen where no house had existed for many, many years. Disturbing personality changes emerged, even resulting in a transformation of eye color from brown to blue. The toll taken on the emotional and physical health of the family soon became too much to endure and they were forced to abandon the house in 1974.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;	Hopefully, this book will cause skeptics to think again to avoid a similar shock to the senses. The family had a rude awakening. Its never easy finding out that you cant always trust your senses, that nothing is really impossible and that there is a breaking point for everyone. Whether the reader is a died-in-the-wool skeptic, a searcher, a believer or somewhere in between, I hope everyone reads these pages with an open mind. It is all true!&lt;/P&gt;
        Echoes of a Haunting has recently been chosen as a textbook for a Masters Degree Program in Parapsychology at Texas Christian University. The Professor teaching the course, Dr. Timothy Barth, has stated that its the best documented case of a haunting he has ever read. 
        The house is currently being investigated by Paranormal researchers who have taken startling photos of &quot;energy orbs&quot; and strange colored lights in the area. Hopefully, these photos will be available soon on the Authors website." />
