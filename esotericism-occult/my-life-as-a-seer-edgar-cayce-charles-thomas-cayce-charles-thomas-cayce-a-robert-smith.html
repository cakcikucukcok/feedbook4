  <title>My Life as a Seer - Edgar Cayce, Charles Thomas Cayce, Charles Thomas Cayce, A. Robert Smith</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;For over seventy-five years, the prophecies and readings of Edgar Cayce-- The Sleeping Prophet-- have inspired millions of people around the world, and been the subject of hundreds of books. Over fifty years after his death, Cayce is still regarded as the father of the new age movement, and the foremost psychic of the twentieth century. His thoughts on the soul&#39;s journey, past lives, dreams, ancient civilizations, and astrology are still closely studied and followed by practitioners in these fields. But until now, only those who knew and studied him have been able to tell Cayce&#39;s story and philosophy. From Jess Stearn&#39;s&lt;i&gt; The Sleeping Prophet &lt;/i&gt;to Thomas Sugrue&#39;s &lt;i&gt;There Is a River&lt;/i&gt;, many bestselling books have sold millions of copies and touched many lives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, for the first time, Edgar Cayce tells his story in his own words. Only recently discovered, this new memoir delivers Cayce&#39;s important message to the world at a most crucial time, the dawn of the twenty-first century. In this personal, moving story, readers learn how Cayce felt about his amazing powers. Here Cayce speaks about the angelic presence that visited his childhood Kentucky home and told him that he would become a healer to millions. We also learn about his extraordinary childhood ability to learn his school lessons simply by sleeping on his books. Cayce also addresses the devastating throat paralysis that he miraculously overcame, and how he ultimately realized that his powers could only be used to help and enable people, and not for personal profit. Cayce even gives a &quot;behind the scenes&quot; glimpse at his many psychic readings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The combination of ability and humility, compassion and caring turned Cayce from social outcast to world-renowned psychic healer. Throughout his life, Edgar Cayce&#39;s was the voice people turned to for advice on issues as diverse as health and healing and philosophy and world issues. Now, Cayce speaks once more on these issues and delivers his ultimate message to humanity for the first time. &lt;i&gt;My Life as a Seer&lt;/i&gt; brings to life the emotional frustrations, motivations, fears, and visions of the century&#39;s premier spiritualist.&lt;/p&gt;" />
