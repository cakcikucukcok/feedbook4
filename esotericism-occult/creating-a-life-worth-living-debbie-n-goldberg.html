  <title>Creating a Life Worth Living - Debbie N. Goldberg</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Thank you for sharing your spiritual journey with me. In volume 1 you learned to master your internal world, how to connect to Spirit, and that many of us live unconsciously, guided by our ego. You now understand that you have the ability to create a fulfilling and purposeful life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Volume 2, we go deeper into our conversation with Spirit to clarify our lifes purpose and understand the steps we need to take to bring us to our true calling.  We strengthen our resolve and remain steadfast on our journey.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Did you know that you are the creator of your life? You are, and this book will help you understand what you have been creating and why? In order to create a life worth living we need to understand the different parts of us that are preventing us from moving into a life of love, peace, purpose, joy and creativity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The love that comes from Spirit is transformational love. It is a love that encircles you and allows you to grow, heal and evolve. In order to enhance your life and your relationships you need to understand the art of loving yourself. Your transformation changes everything around you,  Creating A Life Worth Living.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Transformational love is not a love that you encounter on an earthly plane nor can it be found there. This love baths you in truth and light showing you the blessing and miracle you truly are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everything you need for your lifes journey is within you.  Allow me to help you find this love within and awaken to a new world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Creating A Life Worth Living is a series of books that build upon each other and should be read in sequence to get the most out of them.&lt;/p&gt;" />
