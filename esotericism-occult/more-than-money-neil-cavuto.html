  <title>More Than Money - Neil Cavuto</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;In this phenomenal &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; bestseller, Neil Cavuto shares the inspirational stories of an array of personal heroes, many of whom motivated him to continue his career as he battled cancer and multiple sclerosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Joining the nascent Fox News Channel in 1996, Neil was set to establish himself as one of business journalism&#39;s most important players. Ten years after being diagnosed with cancer, however, Cavuto was dealt another body blow: He was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis. As friends and strangers alike gathered to offer their support, he became attuned to the stories of others in the business world who also triumphed over serious setbacks of their own. &lt;em&gt;More Than Money&lt;/em&gt; shares with us their personal stories, among them:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Evelyn Lauder, the cosmetics executive who pioneered the pink ribbon campaign after her own battle with breast cancer&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Richard Branson, who overcame dyslexia and used his creativity and entrepreneurial spirit to build the Virgin empire &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Michael Wilson, a senior executive at the Royal Bank of Canada, who launched a public campaign to raise awareness of and money for treating depression after his son committed suicide&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Jon Huntsman, who survived two bouts with cancer to build one of the largest petrochemical companies in the world and found one of the most prominent cancer research centers&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Moving, sincere, and wise, &lt;em&gt;More Than Money&lt;/em&gt; profiles individuals whose stories are a testament to courage, compassion, and dignity in the face of adversity.&lt;/p&gt;" />
