  <title>The Soul and Secrets of Its Structure - Larisa Seklitova, Ludmila Strelnikova</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Since ancient times people have known about existence of the soul. Every present religion on the Earth acknowledges that the man has it and all religions confirm that the soul is immortal and its loss is equal to death. People offer prayers about salvation of their souls as the greatest value. Many religions accept the reincarnation theory i.e. incarnating of the soul when the soul leaves human body after death and moves to newly born human body to proceed its development.
Thus, what is the soul and whats the structure? Our Heavenly Teachers have decided that it is time to give the humanity of third millennium new knowledge about the soul as people of sixth race who will live on the Earth in this period of time will be able to accept and understand these revealed truths. This book is devoted to this topic.
New knowledge about the soul is shown up with care not to shock by the avalanche of new concepts. For the first time they revealed that the soul is not only the eddy of invisible spirit but it has like the human body its own structure. The first chapter of the book is about the structure of the soul.
Creation of Soul
Jesus Christ says in the Bible: In my Fathers house there are many rooms. This means there are many inhabited worlds in the Cosmos. Souls for these worlds are created by God himself and his aides  special Hierarchical Systems. It takes 9 cosmic years to create one soul. One cosmic year is approximately equal to 1 billion earthly years because time of God and time on the Earth flies differently. God creates the soul and makes it spiritual. The only God governs the Great Secret of vivification. Without vivification there cannot be life as well.  
When we asked God What is the soul? He answered: The soul is the integral part of the Absolute. Many souls are sort of its interior filling. They are its main Units like cells in your body. All souls piece out the huge nature of the Absolute and God. 
Structure of Soul
The Soul is the complex energetical construction. It is a volumetric favose structure  matrix, where one volume enters another and all are merged. Cells of the matrix are completely digits which carry out energy. Total volume of the soul is called configuration.
Types of soul configurations vary greatly. The self-construction principle is laid in the matrix. Every soul while developing builds its configuration basing on energetical volumes which fill up cells of the matrix. Qualitative and quantitative composition is different within all matrices. That is the reason why there are no two absolutely similar souls.
The matrix is of great importance for every individual because a personality is not personality without it. Individual ceases existing without the matrix as an inspired creation.
The soul is triune. It consists of 3 principles: plus, minus and managerial. 	When a soul has just been created all these three principles are equal and every part occupies 1/3 of total matrix volume. In the course of development the balance between its parts constantly changes, although if the managerial part reaches half the volume it maintains this balance. This is a program of soul construction.
Soul Development
Development and improvement of soul in everyday life consist in acquisition of life experience, new knowledge, evolving feelings and intellect, but on energetical plane it is enlargement of own energetical potential. The sense of life and any existence in any world is development of soul.
There are only two ways of soul development for the man: plus direction to God and minus one to Devil. Ways of virtue, creativity, development through medicine and additionally way of computation and programming connected with creativity lead to God. Ways of evil, degradation, automatism and programming without creativity principle lead to Devil.
Development of soul in any world is based on a program. Program of development is drawn up per one incarnation in the material body. It is saved on one of hum" />
