  <title>Spirit Connections - Lisa Martin Capozzi</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;It has become acceptable for people to talk freely about their beliefs when it comes to &quot;invisible signs&quot; of spirits among us. People want to believe that there is something that exists beyond the visible. It gives them hope and comfort to think that the dead who&#39;ve crossed over to the afterlife are able to communicate with us. In 1996, when my Mom passed away, she was able to let me know she was okay and that I would be okay too without her in my physical presence. She is no doubt with me in spirit and still sends me signals to remind me of her spiritual presence in my life. I&#39;m not fearful, rather I find myself smiling or laughing with her whenever she shows herself to me. I like talking to people about this blessing. In turn, I have become pleasantly surprised at the stories other people tell me about their unexplainable experiences with spirits. I never knew how many people had experienced the feelings of what I call &quot;spirit connections&quot;.   
People were eager to confide their experiences to me. It inspired me to write this book which includes forty-seven of their stories in hopes that others will realize that even when your loved ones die, they can live on and be with you in spirit. You will always feel their love as long as you keep them alive in your heart. I hope after you read my book, you will feel renewed joy and happiness from the relationships you have with the living and the dead. And I&#39;m pleased the stories are enhanced with seventeen whimsical illustrations by artist Nicole Renee VanDyke. The book will make a perfect gift for anyone who has ever lost a loved one or is curious about life after death." />
