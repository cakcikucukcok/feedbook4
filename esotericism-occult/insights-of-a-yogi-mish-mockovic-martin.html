  <title>Insights of a Yogi - Mish Mockovic Martin</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Written by Mish Mockovic Martin, a woman who has dedicated two decades to the study and sharing of the ancient holistic science of yoga and its transformative powers, Insights of a Yogi introduces you to the core concepts of yoga. By way of a truthful and sometimes stark rendition of the significant events in her life, skillfully interwoven with ancient yogic philosophy, Mish takes you on a vibrant journey through the chakras. In an easy and relatable way, she explains applications of the Yoga Sutras and Bhagavad Gita. By sharing ideas and practices that are applicable to your real-life circumstances, situations, and crises, she will teach you the tools you need to overcome stress and anxiety. 
Mishs life has not always been as serene as it is now. After a severe spinal injury left her paralysed, she knew she needed to harness her inner courage to rebuild and rebound. Through the transformative powers of yoga, she has been able to heal those aspects of her life. Inspired by ancient yogic philosophy, her book contains secrets that will allow you to heal your body and your heart, overcome illness or unhappiness, and come to a place of splendid health, strength, and peace. 
In Mishs words, If you are willing to be open and honest, the light will spread to all aspects of your life, it will remove obstacles and blockages, open doors to self-discovery and the ability to transform and create your life, full of hope and optimism." />
