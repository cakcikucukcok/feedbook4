  <title>Stable Wisdom - Shirley J. Potterton</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Although midlife has been traditionally viewed as a time of decline, science and experience are demonstrating that most of our fears are unsupported. For many women it can be a time to rediscover important aspects of themselves that have been left due to the responsibilities of motherhood and careers.
In Stable Wisdom, lifelong horsewoman Shirley Potterton provides a one-of-a-kind guide for women on a midlife journey that encourages transformation and positive changes with the help of an equine companion.
Potterton, whose love for horses was rekindled at midlife, relies on experiences from her own journey of self-discovery as well as others to share powerful tools and exercises to help women embrace the wisdom of an intuitive creature in order to move forward, develop new skills, and utilize innate strengths. Through a step-by-step plan that can be applied with or without a horse, women can learn how to
	listen to the inner voice for direction;
	create and renew energy levels;
	develop a courageous approach to life;
	bring insight, wisdom, and experience to leadership roles; and
	initiate self-reflection without judgment.
Stable Wisdom provides valuable guidance, tools, and confidence for any woman in midlife who dares to think big and is ready to discover her own unique wisdom and implement exciting life changes." />
