She was astounded that he did it in just a few minutes, while standing on the sidewalk outside of a restaurant, using only words.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Dr. Weiss was so intrigued with this recently discovered tool that she and her husband of over 50 years, Dr. Jonathan B Weiss, went to Nova Scotia, Canada to learn the technique. Using it, they were thrilled to help their clients make important life changes in a fraction of the time, and with a fraction of the pain ordinarily associated with psychotherapy.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Four years and considerable studying later, they became the only Certified Logosynthesis Practitioners and Basic Trainers in the United States.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;" />
