      <meta name="description" content="Looking for God in all the wrong places? Then read this book. Its an in depth journey through the Holy Scriptures of the bible to guide you through Gods pathway of salvation which he has provided for human life on this earth. In the world of today, there are some many avenues and paths to choose in life. God has given man the freedom to choose his own destiny, but in that freedom he has asked that we choose wisely making right choices. What is the right choice in life? This book is here to help answer that question. 
The bible says the fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom; therefore, having godly fear is the first wise path that anyone can choose. Why is it wise to fear God?  It is wise because once we begin to give God his due respect as the creator of life, is where we begin our journey toward discovering every other right and wise pathway life has to offer, which leads to true salvation and in the end eternal life.  
This book is a journey through the Holy Scriptures of the bible in finding that right path to help clear up the fog in the minds of so many looking to know and understand what is true and what is right. God has already laid the foundation by the scriptures that we may have the tools and the ability to build a life of success according to the Master who created this great world in which we live; and who knows best.
If you have a true desire to understand the scriptures and want to know what God can do in your life; if you are confused about the bible and religion but hope to find the pathway leading to true salvation; then read this book. Is is here to give good education on biblical truths. And as you read, keep the bible handy: because this book is designed so that as you read it, you will need the bible for reference; in hopes that you might find the true pathway to paradise." />
