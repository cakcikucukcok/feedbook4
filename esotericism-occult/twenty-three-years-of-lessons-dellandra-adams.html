  <title>Twenty Three Years of Lessons - Dellandra Adams</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Twenty Three Years of Lesson is the first book of the seven ‘Twenty Something Chronicles’ series.’&lt;br /&gt;“No more wondering if you can make a better future tomorrow, start now.” Life has a funny way of reminding you of what is essential and what isn’t. I couldn’t wait one more moment sulking about what could have been; I had to look towards the future. Allow journaling to be your therapy, ask yourself your most in-depth questions and find your answer and know there are people out there who understand and have the compassion to help you through your darkest hours. Just the fact of not being the only one can help some while for others, not letting their pain shown or known brings solidarity. Some things only God and time can heal, but you can make changes in your day to day life to work towards a better view so that you can see your worth and know your value. Taking steps week by week to own back your power can be your most reliable tool. What better support than an altar of hope? My prayer closet has helped me through some of my darkest hours; I hope that my wisdom and experience can bring some form of grace and peace for you too.&lt;br /&gt;Dellandra Adams, a Texas native, a current student at the University of North Texas. The Vice President of P.U.S.H., a student-run organization that advocates and raises awareness in the general public and at the University of North Texas the experiences of youth impacted by the child welfare system with the overall mission of promoting emotional support, resources, fellowship, and a sense of community for foster care alumni pursuing college." />
