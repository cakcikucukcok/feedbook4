  <title>The Golden Keys—To Healing the Spiritual, Emotional, Mental, Physical - Lionel Sabourin</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The subconscious mind is a huge repository system, and it does not know what reality is, other than what you tell it.  Then it will repeat those thoughts, beliefs, patterns, and create your outer reality. Everything starts with a thought.
So what did you tell your subconscious, especially when you were young?  I had allowed others to program memy parents, teachers, churches, governments, society.  The subconscious then created aspects, sub-personalities that developed their own view of reality.
Do you remember every decision that you made and thought was real? I didnt, yet one decision I did when I was twenty months affected me until I was about forty-seven years old. That decision was I cant do what I want. I kept being blocked by my own subconscious mind because of what I had told it. 
There are many other examples in the book of how decisions can affect life, decisions about money, relationships, intimacy, weight /diets, diseases, cancer, arthritis, fibromyalgia, anxieties, depression, etc.
I hope you find some answers by reading this book." />
