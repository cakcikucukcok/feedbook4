  <title>Heartbreak and Happiness - Jonathan Merrick</title>
      <meta name="description" content="To all adoptive parents whose yearning for a child enabled you to persevere, even in your darkest days when you thought it would never happen and the system seemed cold and uncaring. They say what doesnt kill us makes us stronger, but, in our case, it very nearly didand the ramifications continue.
Has this journey been a blessing or a curse? The jurys still out on that one, as our lives continue to hold pockets of love and joy amid chaos and desperation. 
Lest you think our experience with the British adoption system was because we were gay, we include our friends story at the conclusion of ours; her tale is just as frustrating and gut-wrenching. 
Though we know there are many inspiring and happy adoption stories out there, we still must say to anyone considering adoption: Be prepared and beware!" />
