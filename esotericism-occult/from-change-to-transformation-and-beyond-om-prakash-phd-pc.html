  <title>From Change to Transformation and Beyond - Om Prakash PhD Pc</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;center&gt;Praise for From Change to Transformation and Beyond&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have had the distinct pleasure of working with Dr. Prakash and know firsthand of his passion and unique qualities in working with people. This book is a wonderful expression of his gift in understanding Transformative Changes that unfold in each of our lives. Im certain that when you follow the practices in his book you too will experience a deeper awakening and joy in the unfolding of life as it happens.&lt;br&gt;
Wade Lindstrom, Director of Coaching, Professional Education Institute&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I met Dr. Prakash at a professional meeting im 2009. My life has never been the same! His life lessons and his introduction to mediation have been inspiring and touched my life in a very deep way. Just being in the presence of this man is transformational!.&lt;br&gt;
Dr. Jayne Gardner, Principal, the Gardner Institute, a training school for people wanting to become spiritual coaches&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No one sets out to create an unsuccessful life. That goes without saying. But how to create a successful life is the journey of a lifetime. It starts with practice, practicing right relationship with the mind, practicing right relationship with the emotions; practicing right relationships with the present moment; practicing right relationship with inner and outer based relationships. So as you can see, a successful life is the natural by-product of a wise and transformative, well-executed practice. Dr. Prakash has written the definitive bible on transformational change. His wisdom offers us more than just the fine art of practice makes perfect. He offers the transcendent gift of how to practice to realize you are perfect. Warning: This book contains the seeds of a transformational personal revolution. Read at the risk of creating a wildly successful life.&lt;br&gt;
Vaishali, author of &lt;i&gt;You Are What You Love&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Wisdom Rising&lt;/i&gt;, syndicated radio show host, and life management expert&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Om Prakash is a very wise soul. He once taught a group of coaches at Mentor Coach to meditate. I walked away with the ability to meditate and an overwhelming sense of his passion and energy for life and giving. His keen intelligence andwarmth of character draw people to him. Om has had many successes in his life and the people he has touched are better for their contact with him.&lt;br&gt;
Anne Durand, MCC
&lt;p&gt;The desire to become, to transform, has taken on new meaning in these tumultuous times. People are hearing the call to a more mindful life, a life of authentic and right choice. Dr. Prakash brings a rich background and strong voice to those who aspire for balance and the deeper meaning. Change is inevitable; how you move in change is not. Dr, Prakesh leads you on a path of centered practices designed enrich your personal journey.&lt;br&gt;
