  <title>Early in His Presence - Joyce A. Harris</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Early in His Presence is a devotional book designed to encourage Christians and non-Christians to devote at least two hours and forty minutes a day for reading the Bible and prayer for spiritual growth and maturity. The time mentioned was derived from the twenty-four hours a day that God gives to each of us.  Its like the tithing principle: 10 percent of all your income to be given to the Lord. If God gives us twenty-four hours a day, giving Him 10 percent of our time is two hours and forty minutes a day.  Dont try to do it all at once, but gradually grow into it a little at a time until you can do it.  Keep track of the time you spend with the Lord, even if its only fifteen minutes.  Gradually keep adding on to it until you have accomplished your goal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These devotionals should encourage you to desire a closer walk with the Lord and to develop a closer personal relationship with Him. Before you begin your quiet time in His presence, pray and ask God to open your heart and mind to receive what He has for you each day. I am confident you will be inspired, revived, recharged, and blessed as you spend time Early In His Presence.&lt;/p&gt;" />
