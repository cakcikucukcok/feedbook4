  <title>Quantum Experiences - Oliver Twist</title>
      <meta name="description" content="At first, I write about my experiences in general terms and then in more detail. I share a particularly essential &#39;quantum experience&#39; with my aunty that passed away about fifteen years ago which aided me to develop morally, academically, psychologically and transpersonally. Some more challenging experiences are part of my spiritual journey. How I managed and integrated such experiences within the &#39;shared reality&#39; is explained. Towards the middle of the book I discuss understandings of the medical model and how this viewpoint often debilitates a person rather than helping an individual with &#39;quantum experiences&#39;, also known as &#39;spiritual emergencies&#39; or &#39;spiritual crises. I critically discuss unhelpful attitudes to such experiences and contribute by adding ideas of how to improve and add to the medical model rather than rejecting, or devaluing it completely. I do this partly by suggesting to introduction of spirituality into the N.H.S. (National Health Services). Furthermore, I critically introduce how calibre psychiatrists could aid and empower individuals with &#39;quantum experiences&#39; rather than pathologise or stigmatise. The end of my book illustrates how my unique and valuable experiences enabled me to develop, further grow both professionally and spiritually in greater detail, by embracing transpersonal psychology into my work. Towards the end of the book I also include important contributions of other mental health professionals, by embracing the transpersonal model. I discuss how their work has aided our understanding in greater depth. The book finishes by introducing how philosophical and spiritual ruminations can empower and make a difference with significant and positive change for individuals with &#39;Quantum experiences&#39;. Rather than debilitate him/her with fear and unnecessary interventions. Finally, I touch upon reality by opening up a discussion of what is real i.e. who decides about reality?" />
