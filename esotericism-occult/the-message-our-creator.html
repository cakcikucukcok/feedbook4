  <title>The Message - Our Creator</title>
      <meta name="description" content="A remarkable and awe inspiring dialogue with Our Creator and one of His long time devotees, GO. Our Creator guides and teaches GO on his Spiritual mission and responsibilities while living here on earth. Through this dialogue Our Creator even shows us how we can reach Him and Be more like Him in Spiritual Power, Wisdom and Spiritual Love. Our Divine Inheritance is loudly broadcasted and made available to each one of us if we listen and read with an open heart and sincerity what He wants us to know and Be in this life time.
When you start loving your Divine Self you start being responsible for all My Creations. 
My Message is for sincere seekers who want My help.
The masses of My People begin to hint that they are something more than themselves.
Each sense it but just cant wrap their hands around this stirring, this restlessness in them.
My Word is so important to get to everyone now. May the blessings Be love ones! Your Creator" />
