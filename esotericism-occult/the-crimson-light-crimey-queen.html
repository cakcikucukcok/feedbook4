  <title>The Crimson Light - Crimey Queen</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The Crimson Light: A Bridge to Actualising Self-full Love is a life transformational journey that rests on the premise Nothing happens by chance but by the choices we make. 
After witnessing the scene of Mr. Barack Altidore stepping into a tombed casket, Lauviah becomes haunted by the question Why am I here? only to be convinced that she must have subconsciously made the decision to be there at the exact moment of it happening. If that was the case, then why would she do a thing like that? 
The quest for answers had opened up many bright paths of hope, including hills and smoke-like valleys of emotions, but often felt like stepping on thorns of her familys history of sexual, mental, and physical abuse. 
Lauviahs main challenge was not only the emblem of fear of each thorn but also to allow herself the sense of worthiness by which she could bathe in the feeling of sweet-scented red rose petals. She needed the tender properties for healing her broken spirit. 
Like an alchemist, Lauviah relies on her insightful ability to see things from various angles and finds a wealth of beauty deep inside her that showed up even in bags of coals. 
Her journey demonstrates openness and honesty that makes her intentions quite transparent. Her ability to focus, with purpose, takes her beyond the five senses, where she unreservedly acts on her intuitions, dreams, and imaginations in achieving her goals. 
The Crimson Light illustrates the benefits of feeling stuck by which one is allowed the free-view opportunities to intently look in lifes huge mirror and to see what changes to make and to know oneself. 
This journey of actualising self-full love reverberates a sacred vow witnessed by body and mind, where both heart and soul. Say I do to the Crimson Light." />
