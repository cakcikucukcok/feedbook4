  <title>The New Thought Collection #1 - Charles F. Haanel</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;The New Thought Movement paved the way for the modern prosperity movement. It was the New Thought writers who first brought attention to the concept of manifesting wealth, right thinking, and the power of positive thinking. Without their landmark works, many of today&amp;rsquo;s best selling prosperity books could not have been written. Now together for the first time are ten more of the most important books ever written on the subject of Wealth and Success by the best New Thought writers. We&amp;rsquo;ve gathered another 1,000+ pages of the best advice and instruction that you&amp;rsquo;ll ever receive on how to become successful, for one incredibly reasonable price. The writers in this volume are all legendary and for good reason. It&amp;rsquo;s time to stop hoping for success and do something about getting it. This book will guide you every step of the way. Collected in this omnibus edition are: &amp;lsquo;Think and Grow Rich&amp;rsquo; by Napoleon Hill; &amp;lsquo;The Science of Getting Rich&amp;rsquo; by Wallace D. Wattles; &amp;lsquo;The Master Key System&amp;rsquo; by Charles F. Haanel; &amp;lsquo;In Tune With The Infinite&amp;rsquo; by Ralph Waldo Trine; &amp;lsquo;Creative Mind and Success&amp;rsquo; by Ernest Holmes; &amp;lsquo;The Game of Life and How to Play It&amp;rsquo; by Florence Scovel Shinn; &amp;lsquo;Foundation Stones to Happiness and Success&amp;rsquo; by James Allen; &amp;lsquo;Mind Power: The Secret of Mental Magic&amp;rsquo; by William Walker Atkinson; &amp;lsquo;The Power of Awareness&amp;rsquo; by Neville Goddard; and &amp;lsquo;The Success System That Never Fails&amp;rsquo; by William Clement Stone.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;" />
