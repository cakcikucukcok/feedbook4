  <title>The Face of Love Volume Ii - Deborah A. Reeves</title>
      <meta name="description" content="You are a person of value, a person who possesses unfathomable abilities, talents, skills and blessings.  Psalm 139:14, I will praise you, for I am fearfully and wonderfully made; marvelous are your works, and that my soul knows very well.  You have the power to choose whether you want to live a life of survival or a life of abundant living.  Are you willing to become more of who you are meant to be?  What do you want out of life?  What are you willing to give for life?  If you are ready to live in the present today, to count your blessings, to forgive and to trust, this book is for you.
Each day is a gift from God.  Thank Him.  Trust that He has allowed you to live this day for a reason.  Be willing to examine yourself and see if you are where He wants you to be.  Be willing to grow for Him.  Be willing to serve Him.  Be thankful that He spared you and gave you life this day.  I have been encouraged to see myself through the eyes of my son KT III who believes in me no matter what.  I thank God for him.  God wants us to see His son Jesus.  Mark 9:22-24, Jesus said to him, If you can believe, all things are possible to him who believes." />
