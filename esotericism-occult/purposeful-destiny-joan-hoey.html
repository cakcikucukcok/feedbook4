  <title>Purposeful Destiny - Joan Hoey</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;This is a book for persons of deep faith or none, and everyone in between. Therapist and trainer Joan Hoey, LCSW, takes you on a journey of the soul, beginning with her own story and including the transformations achieved by her clients struggling to unblock themselves and find their highest best destiny.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everyone has a purposeful destiny, but most of us need help to travel down a different road. Sometimes the obstacles on our way to love and fulfillment are calling cards from a higher power, asking us to make a change. Other times, spirit guides enter our lives through unexpected coincidences or in the shape of those who have loved us and still watch over us. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reading this book may give you that strong pull in the pit of your stomach, because weve all been where Joan and her clients have found themselves: blocked in our own lives but longing for change and fulfillment. Purposeful Destiny draws on the subtle and shrewd psychological insights gained over her career but also her openness to the higher powers that help us get beyond ourselves and give our lives a mysterious unity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of all, Purposeful Destiny is an invitation to change your own life, free yourself from the obstacles, break the negative patterns, and discover the love and freedom waiting for you. It can be an amazing journey, but it may just begin by taking this ride with Joan Hoey.&lt;/p&gt;" />
