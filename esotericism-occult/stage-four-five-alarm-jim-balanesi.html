  <title>Stage Four, Five Alarm - Jim Balanesi</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;And looking at them Jesus said to them,&lt;br /&gt;With men this is impossible,&lt;br /&gt;But with God all things are possible.&lt;br /&gt;Matthew 19:26&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Who holds you up when adversity comes and shakes you downwhen youre told that youre going to die from your illness, your income has burned to the ground, and the housing market has fallen? Who is going to be there to help you up?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stage Four, Five Alarm is the true story of how Jim Balanesi and his wife, Cindy, overcame stage four lung cancer and a fire that destroyed their successful caf through the love and grace of God. These experiences took them on a journey of discovery, learning what their lives are truly all about. Instead of giving up, which would have been so easy, they followed God and His Word, making them stronger with each step. It was a challenge to move forward, but they struggled to stay on the path because they wanted to win these battles once and for all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God gave them the courage, guidance, strength, and knowledge to continue on together through the hardest of times. Their spirits could have been blown apart by these tragediesif not for their growing relationship with God and His Son, Jesus. Stage Four, Five Alarm shares how their love has kept them together and made them into the strong believers they are today.&lt;/p&gt;" />
