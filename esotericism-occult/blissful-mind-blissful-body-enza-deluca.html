  <title>Blissful Mind, Blissful Body - Enza DeLuca</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;We can all learn from the humble lotus flower. It grows in mud and yet never lets this humble origin keep it from enjoying the full radiance of the sun. It never lets anything get in the way of its potential or its true beauty. For this reason, the lotus is a symbol of enlightenment. Like the lotus, we all have within ourselves the power to make the most of each moment. We begin to realize our true potential in the moment we choose to break free of the mud that would keep us trapped and limited. When we embrace our sheer potential, we stand grounded to the earth, deep in mud, ever looking to the sky.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;In this guide, yoga teacher Enza DeLuca shares her inspiring approach to lifes challenges and opportunities. She believes that we each have unlimited potential beauty within us and that our radiance is blocked only by our own limiting thoughts, beliefs, words, and actions. She seeks to inspire readers to love the body they have. By harnessing the power of the Law of Attraction, you can manifest the body that your heart desires.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;There are many paths on the journey to realising your inner beauty. Everyone has an individual path on this planet. Each journey begins with a single powerful moment of intent, and Enza invites you on the journey of a lifetime. Let your individual beauty shine.&lt;/P&gt;" />
