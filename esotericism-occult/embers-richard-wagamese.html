  <title>Embers - Richard Wagamese</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;&quot;Life sometimes is hard. There are challenges. There are difficulties. There is pain. As a younger man I sought to avoid them and only ever caused myself more of the same. These days I choose to face life head on&amp;#151;and I have become a comet. I arc across the sky of my life and the harder times are the friction that lets the worn and tired bits drop away. It&#39;s a good way to travel; eventually I will wear away all resistance until all there is left of me is light. I can live towards that end.&quot;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&amp;#151;Richard Wagamese, &lt;I&gt;Embers&lt;/I&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;In this carefully curated selection of everyday reflections, Richard Wagamese finds lessons in both the mundane and sublime as he muses on the universe, drawing inspiration from working in the bush&amp;#151;sawing and cutting and stacking wood for winter as well as the smudge ceremony to bring him closer to the Creator. &lt;I&gt;Embers&lt;/I&gt; is perhaps Richard Wagamese&#39;s most personal volume to date. Honest, evocative and articulate, he explores the various manifestations of grief, joy, recovery, beauty, gratitude, physicality and spirituality&amp;#151;concepts many find hard to express. But for Wagamese, spirituality is multifaceted. Within these pages, readers will find hard-won and concrete wisdom on how to feel the joy in the everyday things. Wagamese does not seek to be a teacher or guru, but these observations made along his own journey to become, as he says, &quot;a spiritual bad-ass,&quot; make inspiring reading.&lt;/div&gt;" />
