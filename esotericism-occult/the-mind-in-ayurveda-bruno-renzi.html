  <title>The mind in Ayurveda - Bruno Renzi</title>
      <meta name="description" content="In the tradition of Vedic Knowledge, Consciousness is not a dimension consequent to the peculiar phylogenetic development of the human being, nor is it a configuration that emerges in relation to the organization of the Central Nervous System, but it is considered, on the contrary, a basic dimension of nature.&lt;br /&gt;
It is an original nucleus at the base of existence, &amp;ldquo;a vast and unlimited unified field that originates and pervades every phenomenon expressed in nature.&amp;rdquo; (Maharishi Maesh Yogi, 1966)&lt;br /&gt;
Experience teaches us that the Self has already existed for a long time and is more ancient than the ego, which represents the secret &lt;i&gt;spiritus rector&lt;/i&gt; or guiding spirit of our destiny. The Self, as such, does not become conscious&lt;i&gt; eo ipso&lt;/i&gt; (on its own), but it has always been taught, if it is taught at all, by a tradition, by knowledge&amp;hellip;&lt;br /&gt;
Therefore, like every other archetype, it cannot be located, confined within the area of ego consciousness, but it behaves as if it were an atmosphere surrounding man without well-defined spatial or temporal limits&amp;hellip; (C.G. Jung)&lt;br /&gt;
Within the vision of the mind in Vedic Science, the author highlights the importance of crucial preconceptional quantum factors that make up the &amp;ldquo;olographic memory&amp;rdquo;, that morphogenetic field which, at the level of DNA, determines temperamental phenotypical expression, and the existential project of the individual within a well-defined flow of consciousness." />
