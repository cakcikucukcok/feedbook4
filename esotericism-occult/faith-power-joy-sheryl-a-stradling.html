  <title>Faith, Power, Joy - Sheryl A Stradling</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Faith, Power, Joy&lt;/em&gt; tells the multi-generational saga of a family of women who followed their intuition, demonstrated their faith, and transformed their challenges into opportunities for service and joy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The women&amp;rsquo;s stories begin in 1890, when the author&amp;rsquo;s great grandmother challenged a family friend in a bet and went on to overcome unexpected tragedy, grief and loss. She learned to share her faith through love and helping others heal. Her daughter enjoyed a stellar career as an educator in the public schools, which she achieved through determination to overcome the limiting social norms of her times, and her eldest daughter confronted lifetime illness and personal loss with courage and determination.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The author reveals these women&amp;rsquo;s secrets for successful living as well as her own personal growth through spiritual practice and holistic healing, while her own daughter shares the source of her strength though her devotionals and examples of Christ-centered living. Their stories are both joyful and heartbreaking as each reveals her methods for overcoming adversity and transforming obstacles into opportunities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These remarkable women built on the spiritual growth of their foremothers. They share their secrets for creating powerful and courageous lives through applying the spiritual principles of forgiveness, love, faith and service. Their stories inspire us with timeless guidance to harness our inner power, live by our faith, and share our joy.&lt;/p&gt;" />
