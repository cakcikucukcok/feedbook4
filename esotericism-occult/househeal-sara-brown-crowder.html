Weaving timeless universal principles with the practical details of daily life, HouseHeal helps you to connect with your true power, know what you want, and move into action at home in a way that feels natural and life-affirming, even fun! HouseHeals compassionate and inspiring step-by-step approach gives you the understanding, skills and motivation you need to create a more beautiful home, and a more beautiful life, now. &lt;/p&gt;
