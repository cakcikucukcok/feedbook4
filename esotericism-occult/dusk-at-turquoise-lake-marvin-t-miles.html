  <title>Dusk at Turquoise Lake - Marvin T. Miles</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Dusk at Turquoise Lake&lt;/i&gt; is about the mystique of any given day. It is an exhilarating exploration about life, love, yearning, and retrospection.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Two lovers displaced by their careers and life paths live on different continents. During their separation, the author refuses to lapse into zombiesque depression. Instead, he writes to his beloved as an attempt to dissolve the time and space between them.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Though separated from their mutual breath, he delves into the nature of things, whether through conceptual, spiritual or personal experience. What unfolds is an extraordinary journey that unleashes creativity and insight. He paints emotions, deep and penetrating ideas, and conceptual and spiritual philosophies that will either draw them together or pull them apart.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;The author&#39;s lilting prose chronicles the pain of absence, gentle acceptance and insightful understanding of separation and unity, fate and destiny.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Dusk at Turquoise Lake&lt;/i&gt; is a time capsule. It is a love story that began years ago, which is both personal and universal. It brings the author to the present, most certainly altered, more mature, and deepened.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;For any explorer of the heart and soul, &lt;i&gt;Dusk at Turquoise Lake&lt;/i&gt; is a journey that opens a pathway to self-discovery and reflection on life&#39;s only true work - to love and be loved.&lt;/p&gt;" />
