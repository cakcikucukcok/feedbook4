  <title>Intuition - Osho</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Discover your own deep well of wisdom in &lt;i&gt;Intuition: Knowing Beyond Logic&lt;/i&gt;--from one of the greatest spiritual teachers of the twentieth century.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Intuition deals with the difference between the intellectual, logical mind and the more encompassing realm of spirit. Logic is how the mind knows reality, intuition is how the spirit experiences reality. Osho&#39;s discussion of these matters is wonderfully lucid, occasionally funny, and thoroughly engrossing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All people have a natural capacity for intuition, but often social conditioning and formal education work against it. People are taught to ignore their instincts rather than to understand and use them as a foundation for individual growth and development--and in the process they undermine the very roots of the innate wisdom that is meant to flower into intuition.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this volume, Osho pinpoints exactly what intuition is and gives guidelines for how to identify its functioning in others and ourselves. You will learn to distinguish between genuine intuitive insight and the &quot;wishful thinking&quot; that can often lead to mistaken choices and unwanted consequences. Includes many specific exercises and meditations designed to nourish and support each individual&#39;s natural intuitive gifts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Osho challenges readers to examine and break free of the conditioned belief systems and prejudices that limit their capacity to enjoy life in all its richness. He has been described by the &lt;i&gt;Sunday Times&lt;/i&gt; of London as one of the &quot;1000 Makers of the 20th Century&quot; and by &lt;i&gt;Sunday Mid-Day &lt;/i&gt;(India) as one of the ten people--along with Gandhi, Nehru, and Buddha--who have changed the destiny of India. Since his death in 1990, the influence of his teachings continues to expand, reaching seekers of all ages in virtually every country of the world.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />
