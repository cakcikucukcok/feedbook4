  <title>Just Be - Ambassador Erieka Bennett</title>
      <meta name="description" content="It&#39;s a privilege to grow old gracefully. You must abandon all fears and stereotypes of Aging and plunge fully into it with enthusiasm, tact and even the childlike wonder of discovering new things. Just be.
In her third book, JUST BE: AGING GRACEFULLY, Ambassador Erieka Bennett seeks to impart wisdom she has gained in living life fully, unapologetically and magically for 65 years. With an international career encompassing corporate communications and diplomacy throughout Africa, Erieka is well-positioned to present a broad view of what it takes to step into senior status feeling healthy and optimistic about the years ahead. 
It is my hope that this book will complement other material on spiritual, physical and emotional health that has begun to inspire a paradigm shift on the approach to aging well, she explains.
Its a great privilege to grow older, and we can make it more fun by altering our thoughts and attitudes. Aging should be seen as a time to do what you love  and just be. Contrary to the obnoxious idea that life is coming to an end when we see the first gray hair, we should prepare for and treat aging as the rewarding start of something new.
Anyone can age gracefully, with the right tools. This must-read gem- Just Be: Aging Gracefully - is such a tool, especially for the man or woman over 50 but also for young adults. As Erieka explains, its never too early to start paving the way for rich, productive, healthy and beautiful twilight years." />
