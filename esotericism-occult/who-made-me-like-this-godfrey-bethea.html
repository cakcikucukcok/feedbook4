  <title>Who Made Me Like This? - Godfrey Bethea</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Who Made Me Like This? sits the reader next to Godfrey Huk Bethea as he tells the story of his life, beginning with his childhood spent on the streets of Brooklyn, New York, where he found himself exposed to the full gamut of urban life. Then, in a change that permanently altered his lifes trajectory, his parents decided to move the whole familyincluding Huk and his eight siblingsfrom the urban and culturally varied borough of Brooklyn to Lancaster, Pennsylvania, known both for its location in rich farming country and as a hub of Pennsylvania German life.
The imprint of Brooklyn life left its mark on Huk, who sought an opening to escape from his Lancaster exile. Immersed in the messages of the Bible, Huk found himself tugged into ministry as a pastor. He served as an assistant pastor in Philadelphia and then as the pastor of a church in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, the states capital. Then, ultimately and perhaps a bit ironically, he returned to Lancaster to serve for two decades as the pastor of Kings Temple.
If you find yourself asking a questionWho made me like this?the account that Godfrey Huk Bethea shares in Who Made Me Like This? may help you, by hearing his answer to the question, to come to some answers for yourself. This inspirational memoir is for everyone who desires to know how God works in our so human lives to guide and direct us to the ends He desires for us." />
