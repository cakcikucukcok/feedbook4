  <title>Encounter in Rendlesham Forest - Nick Pope, John Burroughs, Jim Penniston</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Roswell was only the beginning! An in-depth look at the Rendlesham Forest UFO Incident, the world&#39;s most sensational and compelling series of UFO encounters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 1980, a UFO was tracked on military radar in Rendlesham Forest, England.  It landed near two of the most strategically important military bases in NATO, and was approached by military witnesses who touched the hull. This explosive new book tells the full story of this incident, which is set to become better-known than Roswell. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Written by Nick Pope, an international bestselling author and former government UFO investigator, working closely with John Burroughs and Jim Penniston, the two officers at the heart of the encounters, &lt;i&gt;Encounter in Rendlesham Forest&lt;/i&gt;  reveals the first-hand witnesses&#39; full stories for the first time and is supported by numerous formerly-classified documents obtained under the Freedom of Information Act. The inside story of these events and their aftermath will change people&#39;s perceptions about UFOs and about the true role played by government, the military and the intelligence agencies.&lt;/p&gt;" />
