  <title>Star * Avatar - Miranda* Linda Weisz</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;I&lt;b&gt;n a profound recollection Miranda* remembers her earthly mission. Under the guidance of Spirit and extra-terrestrials Miranda* undergoes years of training, in multiple dimensions and the synchronistic realm. With spiritual initiations as well as trials and suffering, Miranda* evolves, rapidly integrating lessons learned in other lifetimes, and developing the paranormal abilities needed for the monumental role she is to play as she fulfills her destiny. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;On a trip to Peru in 2001 she finds an ancient engraved stone, and when she unravels its message, it unveils a Truth so astonishing that she guards it in secret. Revealing the written prophecy too soon may unleash the greatest religious and political revolution in the history of mankind. Tuning in to the collective consciousness, Miranda* has waited to come forward until humanity was not only ready for this momentous message, but eagerly awaiting it. With the Mayan Calendar ending in 2012, that time is now. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;After The Secret which quickly spread around the world, this book is The Revelation. Adventure, romance, magic and miracles all come together in an inspiring blend of spirituality, mythology and cosmic science. Incredulous as it may appear, this is a true story.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />
