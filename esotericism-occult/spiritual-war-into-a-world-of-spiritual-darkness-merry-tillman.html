  <title>Spiritual War into a World of Spiritual Darkness - Merry Tillman</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This may be the one of most fascinating book youve ever read.
	There are many things man and woman does not understand. When we read the Bible, it foretells the events that have unfolded since the beginning of time. The Bible speaks truthfully; and it informs us on the past, present, and future. Since the fall of man, evil has had its dark forces lurking here and there, and many people are deceived by it. At this very moment, the works of darkness are taking place; therefore, be on guard to protect yourself. People practice witchcraft for self-motivation, power, and control; however, most may not realize the devastation it causes the person they are trying to harm. Questions go unanswered for countless ones who seek help for this type of darkness. I am Merry Harris Tillman, and I would like to inform the world of the dark forces at work. What is the real truth behind witchcraft? Is it good or is it bad? I will shed light on what witchcraft is and the harm it causes. There are many dangerous situations where life is at risk. It comes in many forms, such as calamities, accidents, and crimes. It exists in locations possessed by evil spirits known as territorial spirits." />
