  <title>Mentis Ludos - Craig Downey</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Tired of the same old arguments? Looking for a new fresh challenge? Even think that there is nothing that could really surprise you about this world? Then why not take a look inside; there could be over fifty good reasons to do this. Mentis Ludos represents quite a range of accessible, controversial mind, body, and spiritual challenges that will have you laughing, crying, and developing all manner of ambivalent emotion as you curse and distantly debate some of the mind-blowing concepts presented within. I dont think I ever actively sought subjects that were open to intellectual challenge from the layman right up to the dedicated professional and definitely did not conceive these ideas for that sole purpose. What I was truly seeking was a touch of magic in my life, something that would open my heart and mind to the possibilities of the world in which we live. I could not live without this and undertook my own personal challenge of finding at least something plausible that would truly engage my entire being. There is nothing really in this world that I truly find distasteful other than a complacent attitude to life. Many of us find adequate outlets in fiction-based subjects, although I seem to crave more than this. I want to experience real mystery, plausible fantasy that takes you to almost exactly the same place as the most spectacular of fictional drama. That really allows you to flex the soul as you are taking on somewhat of a roller-coaster ride through the highs and lows of emotions you may have thought you would never experience." />
