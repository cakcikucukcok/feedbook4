  <title>The Price of Heartbreak - Rick Sharpe</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Failure is failure. I had failed… miserably! I suck at break-ups but who doesn’t? I was the guy next door who “had it all together!” But that’s not what goes on inside.  
My experience had shame written all over it, a significant departure from the person I thought I was. Failing emotionally started a journey filled with the very real pain of heartbreak and the smothering cloud of depression. I discovered what vulnerability really was and how my generation ran from it.  
Search your own heart and find those scars. They never really heal but they become a better part of us. To get through a day you sometimes need some assurance that you are not alone. For those who need to know there is another day worth living, you’re welcome to share this journey." />
