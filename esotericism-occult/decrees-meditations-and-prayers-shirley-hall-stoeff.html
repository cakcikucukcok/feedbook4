  <title>Decrees, Meditations and Prayers - Shirley Hall Stoeff</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Decrees, Meditations, and Prayers is a gift from the ascended masters that will wrap their spiritual vibration around youand at the same time will touch your very soul with comfort and love. They are our sisters and brothers on a very high level of spirituality, seeing into the future and knowing what is needed for our growth. These are the living light words that are laid out for you within these pages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have been fortunate and blessed to be able to work with the blessed masters for more than forty-five years. I am very pleased to know my past incarnations have also been spiritual workers for the light. There is no light-switch for me to turn off. I am a walk-in who is a light worker full time, with the gold ring I see on the birthing wheel.&lt;br /&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;
There are many light workers that have incarnated at this time to do Gods work for mankind, all with different gifts to be used to battle against the negative energies. Pick up your blue-flamed sword and join us. Our hand is extended to you!&lt;/p&gt;" />
