  <title>Citizen King - Les Jensen</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt; Before you were born your soul had a vision of what your life could be. To honor that vision can bring a deep sense of satisfaction and fulfillment into your life, producing feelings of joy, happiness and gratitude.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt; To engage that vision of your life and trust yourself is to turn on the creative expression of your own potential. When you walk authentically as yourself, all possibilities come within your reach. The vision of your dreams comes into focus. You may not know every detail, though you trust in the story of your heart and soul, as they feed you a vision of what is possible. It is intentional creation itself.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt; Your own potential has no limits, and to create a flow of its expression brings an ever-unfolding story of genuine satisfaction and gratitude as you honor your purpose here on Earth. To have big dreams and take bold actions creates a most exciting and adventurous life, fulfilling the vision of your soul.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt; Will you embrace the bold ideas of your heart and soul, and trust that there is a way for them to manifest? Can you do this from a place of personal forgiveness and compassion? When you master that, you start to purify your own heart, the source of your authentic power. When you put action to your inspiration, you give your soul influence in your life. Your soul becomes free to express as it intends. This is soul-level living.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt; Your ego&#39;s role shifts to fulfilling your inspiration with action. It is you acting as a Citizen King. The path to living an exceptional life in your own authentic kingdom affords you a genuine sense of fulfillment and joy. It is the new age of what personal power looks like. It is our human potential ... fulfilled.&lt;/p&gt;" />
