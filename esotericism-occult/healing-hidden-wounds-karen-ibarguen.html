  <title>Healing Hidden Wounds - Karen Ibarguen</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The traumas that accumulate over a persons lifetime are varied and numerous. Sexual assault. Surgical trauma. Car accidents and near misses. Serious illness. War. Traumatic experiences, those remembered or forgotten, can manifest as pain, impaired mobility, addiction, illness, fear, depression, anxiety, lack of confidence, and other suboptimal conditions. Yet regardless of the traumatic event(s) of our lives, human beings have a tremendous capacity to heal. In the tradition of classic spiritually-based healing texts such as Louise Hays Heal Your Body and White Eagles Heal Thyself, Dr. Karen Ibarguens &lt;em&gt;HEALING HIDDEN WOUNDS: A JOURNEY TO LIBERATION&lt;/em&gt; offers readers a window into how the subtle energies of the mind and body work together to create physical and emotional harmony. As Dr. Karen walks readers through her own journey of self-discovery and healing from childhood sexual abuse, she connects readers to a rich legacy of meditation and mind-body consciousness that opens the heart, quiets the mind, and creates a foundation for healing.The traumas we experience need not keep us from our destiny. Indeed, they can lead to liberation.&lt;br /&gt;
Part memoir, part self-help book, part travelers guide to the mystical world of spiritual and energetic healing, &lt;em&gt;HEALING HIDDEN WOUNDS&lt;/em&gt; is like nothing else out there. In addition to offering readers substantial food for thought, this book offers practical ways to bring the ideas to life. It all starts with taking two minutes out of your day to find a quiet spot, sit comfortably, relax and breathe. Karen guides the reader as a process of self-inquiry naturally unfolds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I couldnt put this book down. HEALING HIDDEN WOUNDS is a must read for anyone interested in the journey to personal liberation.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;-Carine Feyten Ph.D., Chancellor of Texas Womans University&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dr. Karen Ibarguen D.C.&lt;/strong&gt; is certified in chiropractic clinical neurology, applied kinesiology, naturopathic medicine, reiki, and homeopathy. Her interest in somatic responses to trauma stems from her personal experience and those of the many patients she has helped to achieve more optimal health and well-being during 17 years of private practice in North Texas. To explore holistic healing modalities and their legacies within ancient traditions, she has spent time with Kogi elders in South America, practiced Karma Yoga in Portugal, worked with a modern-day shaman, taken refuge with the venerable Lama Dorjee Rinpoche, and walked the sacred Tibetan ground of Mount Kailash. She has come to realize through self-inquiry how meditation and other energy practices unite in the pursuit of health and healing. Dr. Ibarguen shares these techniques with her patients and others in trainings and healing workshops. More information can be found on her website at www.KarenIbarguen.com.&lt;/p&gt;" />
