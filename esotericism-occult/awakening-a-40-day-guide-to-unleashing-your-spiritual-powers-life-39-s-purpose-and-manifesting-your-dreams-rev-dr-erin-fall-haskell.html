  <title>AWAKENING: A 40-DAY GUIDE TO UNLEASHING YOUR SPIRITUAL POWERS, LIFE&#39;S PURPOSE, AND MANIFESTING YOUR DREAMS - Rev. Dr. Erin  Fall Haskell</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;#1 Bestseller!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Universe is taking your order 24/7. No words need be spoken. It listens through energy, vibration, and frequency. Life is the ultimate mirror of your consciousness and designed for one thing: Your AWAKENING.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On this transformational 40-day journey, Rev. Dr. Erin Fall Haskell reveals the spiritual truths behind the world&amp;rsquo;s greatest minds and #1 cause of success. You will learn how to unleash your spiritual powers, ignite your life&amp;rsquo;s purpose, manifest your dreams, claim your birthright of prosperity, live with vibrant vitality, powerfully love in your relationships, and create your personal daily spiritual practice. She teaches you how to breakthrough your limiting beliefs and co-create with the Universe, living a life of abundance, vitality, joy, and love!&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In these pages, you&amp;rsquo;re taken step-by-step through transforming your entire life&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;1. Wake Up: It all begins with a powerful decision; The first process of Awakening is the shift within, changing how you view reality. In this section, you will learn how manifestation begins with your consciousness. You will also learn how to live authentically and powerfully. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2. Reprogram: Spiritual work is counterintuitive; it is the opposite of learning because it means letting go of your limiting beliefs and fixed ideas. As you peel back the layers of all you are not, you expand your mind and reveal the Truth of who you are. In this section, you will learn how to command your subconscious mind.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;3. Align: Aligning with your own personal truth and with the Laws of the Universe is the key to manifesting a life you love. In this section, you will be guided to get in the flow of the four primary areas of your life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wealth and Wisdom: Prepare to lead the journey to empty your consciousness of limiting beliefs about money, wealth, and affluence. Learn how to tap into the infinite innovation within, and embody the wisdom of the Universe, which will benefit all aspects of your life. This wisdom will give you the power to claim your birthright of prosperity, abundance, and thriving creativity. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Love &amp;amp; Relationships: Learn to unveil the Truth that the ultimate relationship is found within you, and realize that all other relationships are a reflection and projection of your ability or inability to love. Despite the challenges you face, you can transform your relationships from divided to Divine. Raise your confidence, self-development, self-worth, and self-love.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Health &amp;amp; Wellness: You have an innate power to heal and a life force capable of miracles! Let go of your preconceived notions of well-being, release negative energy, and uncover the secret to vitality, longevity, and wellness.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; Purpose &amp;amp; Calling: Unveil the creative spirit within by transforming the most difficult circumstance you have ever endured into the greatest blessing of your life. You have a gift to give to this world: YOU!&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;4. Affirm: This is a new age journey into the miracle of listening. Create your personal Vision, Mission, and Daily Spiritual Practice. Whether you are advanced or just a beginner, the miracle of listening is found in the practices of Meditation, Mindfulness, Visioning, Intuition, and Affirmative Prayer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s embark on this incredible journey together!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;FREE MASTERCLASS WITH BOOK PURCHASE: www.erinfallhaskell.com/awakeningbook&lt;/p&gt;" />
