  <title>God Bless America? - Richard Ruhling</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;God Bless America? offers a fresh meaning to the Great Sign that was in the sky on September 23, 2017 (YouTube) because of the 9-month pregnancy image pointing to next spring.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The sign, according to astronomers, is a complex convergence of aligning planets and constel-lations that unfolds over 9 months that fits Revelation 12:1,2. Starting September 23, 2017, the sun will be in the virgin, Virgo, and the moon will be at her feet. She will have a crown of nine stars and three planets in alignment making 12. Jupiter, symbol of deity, will be in the womb area, exiting at her feet. What does it mean?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since God guides the stars, it&amp;#39;s not the birth of Christ or He would be 2000 years late.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;God is on time, and He&amp;rsquo;s the Author of nature and the Bible, so we look to the Bible to explain what nature doesn&amp;rsquo;t?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;God called Israel His &amp;ldquo;first-born&amp;rdquo; in Exodus 4:22, but this implies another event. Paul supports this when he included the Exodus and said, &amp;ldquo;All those things happened to them for examples ...ends of the world.&amp;rdquo; 1Cor 10:1,11. The Exodus then, is an example of an event that&amp;rsquo;s impending, signaled by the imagery of Revelation 12:1,2. It&amp;rsquo;s also the imagery of &amp;lsquo;travail on a woman with child&amp;rsquo; when the &amp;lsquo;day of the Lord&amp;rsquo; (end-times) comes with sudden destruction in 1Thessalonians 5:1-3.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;America has many parallels to Egypt as the greatest nation then and now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;1. They killed babies; the US has aborted 60 million.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2. Egypt was a source of food in times of famine as America is for some nations now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;3. Israel went to Egypt in a famine. Pioneers came when the Bread of Life was banned by the papacy in medieval times. Pioneers risked their lives for relief.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;4. Egypt enslaved Israel, but the US has enslaved most of its people with alcohol, tobacco, drugs and bondage to food, gambling, greed, crime, sex, perversion, music, TV, etc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;God is going to execute judgment on the US as He did on Egypt. Israel made a covenant at Sinai and they became God&amp;rsquo;s kingdom and Bride, Exod 19:5,6; Jer 3:14. This brings us to a more biblical understanding of the wedding parables, not a rapture. Readiness for the calamity in those parables is the key to high destiny. The Rule of 1st Use helps us understand them. For example&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The cry at midnight in Matthew 25:6 is first found in Exod 12:29,30 as calamity fell on Egypt. The &amp;lsquo;knock&amp;rsquo; in Luke 12:36 is an earthquake because Laodicea (where He knocked) ended that way. &amp;ldquo;The day of the Lord&amp;rsquo; begins with an earthquake in Joel 2:10,11; Paul says &amp;lsquo;sudden destruction.&amp;rsquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;God Bless America? shows how we can be ready for that event by &amp;lsquo;watching&amp;rsquo; on the eve of Passover (all the wedding parables have Passover imagery) and it&amp;rsquo;s the authentic night for communion and the key to high destiny, Luke 12:35-37,44.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the wedding parables have been misunderstood as a pre-tribulation rapture. For the student of eschatology and end-times, here&amp;#39;s a book that helps explain Bible prophecy and the impending apocalypse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Readiness for a sudden event (cited by Christ in 7 parables, Matthew 24:31- 25:13) and explained in the book so should be important to us because it affects destiny, I urge readers to get a copy of God Bless America?&amp;nbsp; It&amp;#39;s about His Rescue Plan &amp;amp; How We Can Be &amp;ldquo;Ruler Over All That He Has.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Think about it...it&amp;rsquo;s so important to Christ that He is offering to make us &amp;ldquo;ruler over all that He has&amp;rdquo; if we answer His end-time call&amp;hellip;It&amp;#39;s more important to Him than we realize...&lt;/p&gt;" />
