  <title>How Art Can Change Your Life - Iván Fernández</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Is art just a nice-to-have? Or is it deeper, far more integral...even necessary?&lt;/p&gt;
Is there something from Beethoven to help us with that career setback? Is there something from Shakespeare to help us with our relationships? Is there something from Rembrandt to show us who we really are?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is these, amongt other questions that this book probes; through painting, music, literature, architecture, sculpture, photography and filmsspanning cultures - from Europe and Africa to India and Australia, and artistic periods - from the ancient to the modern.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Leveraging his considerable experience as a research professional, Ivan Fernandez combines riveting insights from diverse artists of the past and the present, a dazzling variety of astonishing facts and powerful questions for us to reflect on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In language that is simple, elegant and imbued with passion, Ivan utters an urgent, sincere plea; urging us to draw actionable life lessons from art that can help us rise above ourselves. To make a masterpiece of our own lives. And as a guide on this epic voyage, he takes us on a fascinating journey inward; ploughing not merely the depths of artistic insight, but of the inscrutable human spirit itself!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Fernandez talks about bliss - a term Ive often used. It was through writing about my practice, together with making my work, that I found my bliss. I wish Id had Fernandezs book back in those times when overwhelming doubt inhibited my practice. He brings enlightenment to thinking about art and why artists do what they do. This can help give an artist conviction, and therefore confidence, and a lay person a heightened appreciation of art. This most enjoyable read will bring great insight to artists and lay people alike. A truly inspiring read!&lt;br /&gt;
- Archibald Prize-winning artist and art teacher, Cherry Hood&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ivan Fernandezs cross-disciplinary approach - infusing insights from philosophy, literature, music and art - make this book a great read!&lt;br /&gt;
- Sculptor, Vince Vozzo; member of the decade club&lt;br /&gt;
(exhibited at Sculpture by the Sea ten times or more)&lt;/p&gt;" />
