  <title>Dreaming with God - Alexandra De Avalon</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;In 1992 Alexandra De Avalons son David was killed in an automobile accident. Soon after, she felt his presence, and their spiritual journey began. David has communicated to his mother what happened after his physical death. He validates that he is still alive through miracles that have never stopped. Alexandra shares in a very candid way her spiritual journey and what she does to help heal her grief.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When David made his transition, Alexandra De Avalon had a turning point in her life. She became a healer. This insightful book is about hope, miracles, and encouraging a spiritual healing process with grief.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Breaking through the myth of death to the meaningfulness of the continued spiritual connection with those we love, Alexandras exquisitely written journey invites us into a universal spirituality from Ancient Mayan ritual to loves transformative power. Her words awaken the beauty of prayer, hope, family, faith, and everyday miracles as they affirm the quality of life that unfolds as we listen to the wisdom of our hearts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you know someone who has lost a loved one, give the gift of hope and share this book with them.&lt;/p&gt;
