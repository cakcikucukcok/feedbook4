  <title>37 Seconds - Stephanie Arnold, Sari Padorr</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Like &lt;em&gt;Proof of Heaven&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;To Heaven and Back&lt;/em&gt;, a medical drama with heavenly implications in which a woman receives premonitions of her death that come true, and her discovery of the heavenly help available to all of us.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When she was pregnant with her second child, Stephanie Arnold had a sudden and overwhelming premonition that she would die during the delivery. Though she tried to tell the medical team and her family what was going to happen, neither the doctors nor her loved ones gave her warnings credence. Finding no physical indications that anything was wrong, they attributed her foreboding to hormones and anxiety.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One member of the medical team did take her concerns seriously enough, and made the fateful decision to order extra units of blood &amp;#8220;just in case.&amp;#8221; Then, during the delivery, Stephanie suffered a rare Amniotic Fluid Embolism. She went into cardiac arrest and flat-lined for 37 seconds. She died. Using the supplementary blood, the medical team revived her, and she remained unconscious for more than six days.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After months of recovery, Stephanie began to remember details of her experience, details she knew because she had witnessed the entire dramatic event, including her death, from outside her body&amp;#8212;beside other spirits that were with her. In this remarkable true story, Stephanie recounts her harrowing journey and shares her surprising spiritual discoveries: we are not alone and have more loving help than we can imagine surrounding us.&lt;/p&gt;" />
