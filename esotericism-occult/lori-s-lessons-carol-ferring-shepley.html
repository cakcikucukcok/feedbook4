  <title>Lori’S Lessons - Carol Ferring Shepley</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;When Lori Patin first received her diagnosis of Parkinsons at age fifty-five, she wanted to cry until she died. When she made up her mind to fight the disease, her husband and caregiver, Bob, took a stand beside her. In &lt;em&gt;Loris&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Lessons&lt;/em&gt;, author Carol Ferring Shepley tells the story of the Patins love throughout the course of the disease and how it affected their lives.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But this memoir is about much more than Loris struggle against Parkinsons disease, a progressive, incurable, degenerative disorder that affects the central nervous system. Its also the story of someone who has faced a terrible challenge, met it head-on, and refused to concede. In the struggle, she has learned vital lessons about life itself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Loris Lessons &lt;/em&gt;shares how for fifteen years, Lori fought relentlessly, but in the summer of 2011 she lay in a coma. At the time, Bob thought the best he could hope for was to bring her home with a nurse. Thanks to a miraculous remission, however, today she doesnt even have tremors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Offering inspiration and hope, &lt;em&gt;Loris Lessons &lt;/em&gt;presents a 360-degree perspective on how Lori attacked the disease. She has taken many pharmaceuticals, but the two strongest drugs in her regimen are hope and faith.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />
