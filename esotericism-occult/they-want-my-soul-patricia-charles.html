  <title>They Want My Soul - Patricia Charles</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;This book is a documentation of the life of a Black immigrant from Trinidad. It tells her journey from her arrival to America in search for a greater opportunity for work, earning more money, living comfortably and acculturating herself to the American way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She found all of that and more. What she also found were racist employers, who continue to use immigrants to satisy their own progression and journey in life, but suppress, deny and try to crush the Black immigrants dreams. The author presents her journey openly and off ers a cogent immigrants perspective of a Black womans search for purpose in America.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this book, Patricia Charles, an immigrant from Trinidad, is unashamed to share her experiences in America. It is bold and purposeful defying a life without meaning, and her employers oppressive machinations.... -The Rev. Dr. G. Derek Neriah Paul-Adjunct Professor of Religious Studies.
&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt; According to Patricia Charles this book is about the voice of an ordinary African American
woman, my story, my dreams, my reality and my unequivocal faith in God and His purpose for my life. The author reflects on her own personal experience as a black immigrant, and her encounter with our societys diverse sociopolitical, economic, and cultural institutional structure. Her narrative is a reminder of the nightmares and struggles immigrants have to endure in order to achieve the American Dream. - Professor Grigoris Argeros- Professor of Sociology at Lehman College.&lt;/p&gt;" />
