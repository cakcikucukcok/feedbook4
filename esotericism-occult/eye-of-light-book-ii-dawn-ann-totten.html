  <title>Eye of Light (Book Ii) - Dawn Ann Totten</title>
      <meta name="description" content="As a simple guide to assist you in getting the most out of your life and experiences, the Q&amp;A-style channeled messages are certain to help you feel less alone and more in control of your relationship and career fumbles and follies. Knowing how to classify your friends, family, and the people who surround you on a daily basis gives incredible clarity to the concerns you may have about who to trust with your dreamsand who to keep at a distance. Recognizing who plays the game with you and who sabotages you (or plays for another team) puts you in the drivers seat. The power to clearly see who supports you both directly and indirectly allows you to harness your inner wisdom and serve your selfand your purposebetter. Learn to connect with God Source more completely, and know who your teammates and support characters are. You will also learn how to cut non-team players, ball hogs, and glory hounds in a noninvasive and unaggressive manner. They will simply slip away, leaving you in a state of faith, trust, and work-with mindset. The recap sections throughout part one aid in ease of use and referencing. The last chapter, Exercises and Processes, is all about you. Its purpose is to deepen your inner strength, your connection with Mother Earth and God Source, and anchor your knowledge of who you are and why you are here. Finally, we address changing your path, for those of you who are really fed up with this life!" />
