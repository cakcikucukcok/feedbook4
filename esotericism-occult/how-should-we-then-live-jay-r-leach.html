  <title>How Should We Then Live? - Jay R. Leach</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Many churches today have become ineffective to the kingdom of God because they no longer obey the mandate from our Lord, Jesus Christ.
While many churches are boasting about numbers and membership, the actual purpose of the Christian church, making disciples, seems to have gotten lost or overlooked. Using illustrations and down-to-earth language, Jay Leach unlocks practical principles that illustrate the growth of a disciple from rebirth to maturity. Not only will we enjoy eternal life in the
future, but we will enjoy eternal life here and now. How? By knowing our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ.&lt;p&gt;
In the Bible, knowing carries with it the connotation of intimacy. To enjoy eternal life now, we must have a knowing and intimate relationship with Christ. Relationship and intimacy bring with them the creation of a new
nature and purpose, of forward movement to a fruitful adult discipleship; they also provide a clear understanding of salvation and the process of growing into a mature disciple. The church can provide nurture through small groups and other team-building ministries, but to become a disciple requires a personal commitment. &lt;i&gt;How Should We Then Live?&lt;/i&gt; will explain how to form this very special relationship with Jesus Christ." />
