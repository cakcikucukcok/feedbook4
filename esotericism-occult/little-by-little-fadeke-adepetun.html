  <title>Little by Little - Fadeke Adepetun</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Fadekes story in Little-by-Little is indeed an account of Gods miraculous healing power in a way that shows the sovereignty of God in the affairs of men. I have seen the power of God demonstrated amidst her challenges; I have witnessed firsthand her complete dependence on God and her courage in the face of daunting medical diagnoses. Her story confirms that medicine does not contradict faith, but rather that faith actually supports and enhances medical procedures. I have come to realise that the times when God brings gradual healing actually requires a strong stand of faith on His word over a period of time. Fadeke has clearly demonstrated that the issue of gradual healing is no less spectacular a miracle than instantaneous healing. Dr. Tony Rapu
