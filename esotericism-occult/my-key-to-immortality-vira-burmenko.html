&lt;p&gt;Dear reader, I am inviting you on a journey into simple truths of my life, which I believe will bring you closer to discovering yourself and your own key to immortality. We each have our own path in our own lives, and no one else can show you how to walk yours, because only you know what it is, and only you make it real. I am not going to hand to you the key to eternity, for I can only truly give you a small hintthat it could be the simplest and most complex thing you could ever imagine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sincerely,&lt;br /&gt;
Vira Burmenko&lt;/p&gt;" />
