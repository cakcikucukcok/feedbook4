  <title>Seven Steps to Activating Your Supernatural Funnybone - Alexandra Alexander</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Happiness is not about new cars and bigger houses, its about contentment. Peace and satisfaction evolve out of contentment and laughter is the legitimate child of contentment.&lt;br /&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;
If I put a microphone in your face could you tell me without pause what makes you happy? Most people cant! Why? Because its not our focus! We focus on what makes us unhappy! How long has it been since you had a happy thought? Research shows that small children laugh 300 or more times a day while an adult laughs only 20 at most. What happened to our laughter?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why Laugh? Humor is infectious and laughter is far more contagious than a yawn. Humor and laughter strengthen your immune system and protect you from the damaging effects of stress. Other benefits of laughing instead of grumbling are: less pain, relaxed muscles, less heart disease and better moods. Now isnt that enough reason to make you smile?&lt;/p&gt;" />
