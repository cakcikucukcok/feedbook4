      <meta name="description" content="&lt;b&gt;The must-read summary of Jeff Hoffman and David Finkel&#39;s book: &quot;Scale: Seven Proven Principles to Grow Your Business and Get Your Life Back&quot;.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This complete summary of the ideas from Jeff Hoffman and David Finkel&#39;s book &quot;Scale&quot; shows that budding entrepreneurs must build their business the right way in order to succeed. To do this, they must reduce the company&#39;s reliance on themselves so that the business can grow and eventually be sold. This is what takes an entrepreneur from simply being self-employed to owning a scalable business with multiple employees. The authors explain that scaling a business consists of seven key principles which are split into four phases from building a solid foundation to learning to manage your time. This summary will take you through each principle and help you to create a strategic plan to grow your business while still managing your own time. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Added-value of this summary: &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;• Save time&lt;br&gt;• Understand the key concepts&lt;br&gt;• Increase your business knowledge &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;To learn more, read &quot;Scale&quot; and discover how you can grow your business and still have time to yourself. &amp;lt;:b&amp;gt;&lt;/b&gt;" />
