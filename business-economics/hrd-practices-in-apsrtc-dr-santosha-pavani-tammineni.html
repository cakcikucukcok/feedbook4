  <title>Hrd Practices in Apsrtc - Dr. Santosha Pavani Tammineni</title>
      <meta name="description" content="A complete study on implementation of HRD practices in APSRTC at zonal level is rare in number. In contrast to the earlier practices, an attempt has been made by the researcher to trace out the impact of HRD practices on employees at zonal level and to investigate whether it is implemented in letter and spirit or not by reviewing operational performance of APSRTC and its financial function. This work is not only an in-depth study of HRD practices in APSRTC; the study also presents an overview of the road transport sector in India. With the advent of globalization, transport sectors are confronted with challenges in improving productivity by successfully meeting the intense level of competition from its counterparts. 
Business today is in a period of change and uncertainty. The success will largely depend on how these challenges are matched with the utilization of human resources that is at our disposal. It has been very unfortunate that the APSRTC has limited its human resource developmental practices for some cadres at apex level only without taking organizational climate of various zones into account while training their managerial personnel. But the need of the hour is to put more emphasis on all the HRD practices at managerial level in the background of their level of climate. The researcher looks at the problems of implementing HRD practices in the context of changing technological advancement and government policies." />
