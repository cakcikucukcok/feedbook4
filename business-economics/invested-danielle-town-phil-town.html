  <title>Invested - Danielle Town, Phil Town</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;In this essential handbook&amp;#8212;a blend of &lt;em&gt;Rich Dad, Poor Dad&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;The Happiness Project&lt;/em&gt;&amp;#8212;the co-host of the wildly popular InvestED podcast shares her yearlong journey learning to invest, as taught to her by her father, investor and bestselling author Phil Town.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Growing up, the words finance, savings, and portfolio made Danielle Town&amp;#8217;s eyes glaze over, and the thought of stocks and financial statements shut down her brain. The daughter of a successful investor and bestselling financial author of &lt;em&gt;Rule #1&lt;/em&gt;, Phil Town, she spent most of her adult life avoiding investing&amp;#8212;until she realized that her time-consuming career as lawyer was making her feel anything but in control of her life or her money. Determined to regain her freedom, vote for her values with her money, and deal with her fear of the unpredictable stock market, she turned to her father, Phil, to help her take charge of her life and her future through Warren Buffett-style value investing. Over the course of a year, Danielle went from avoiding everything to do with the financial industrial complex to knowing exactly how and when to invest in wonderful companies. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In&lt;em&gt; Invested&lt;/em&gt;, Danielle shows you how to do the same: how to take command of your own life and finances by choosing companies with missions that match your values, using the same gold standard strategies that have catapulted Warren Buffett and Charlie Munger to the top of the &lt;em&gt;Forbes&lt;/em&gt; 400. Avoiding complex math and obsolete financial models, she turns her father&amp;#8217;s investing knowledge into twelve easy-to understand lessons. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In each chapter, Danielle examines the investment strategies she mastered as her increasing know-how deepens the trust between her and her father. Throughout, she streamlines the process of making wise financial decisions and shows you just how easy&amp;#8212;and profitable&amp;#8212;investing can be.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Capturing a warm, charming, and down-to-earth give and take between a headstrong daughter and her mostly patient dad, &lt;em&gt;Invested &lt;/em&gt;makes the complex world of investing simple, straightforward, and approachable, and will help you formulate your own investment plan&amp;#8212;and foster the confidence to put it into action.&lt;/p&gt;" />
