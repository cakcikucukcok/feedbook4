  <title>Start Your Own Online Coupon or Daily Deal Business - Rich  Mintzer, Entrepreneur magazine</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;Unlike old-school &amp;#147;design your own coupon book&amp;#8221; titles, this book moves straight into computer technology and proceeds to the latest trend in couponing . . . apps, which provide deals to mobile users in any location. Many daily deal businesses do not work to enhance the experience for their merchants.  Readers, however, can learn how to do so. Experts in the industry are also included such as Marc Horne, co-creator of Daily Deal Builder, who discusses what it takes to build a daily deal site, David Teichner, CEO of Yowza!! who brought deal apps to iPhones and several business owners who have tried their luck at running daily deal. They discuss what they have learned from the process.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Currently there are few, if any, other books on how to start a daily deal business and the coupon books focus on how to use coupons and even on extreme couponing, but not on running an online coupon business. This is a unique title which provides those who enjoy offering deals and discounts to get started in an industry that is still growing.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/div&gt;" />
