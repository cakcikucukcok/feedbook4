  <title>What&#39;s Wrong with Damn Near Everything! - Larry Winget</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The Pitbull of Personal Development&lt;sup&gt;®&lt;/sup&gt; Takes on Damn Near Everything!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Larry Winget does not mince words, and in this latest addition to his straight-talking brand, one of the most iconic leaders of the personal development industry puts down in black and white, &lt;i&gt;What&#39;s Wrong with Damn Near Everything!&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;If you think the world is a mess, you already have a lot in common with Larry. The genius and power of his simple approach to turning around the parts of your life that need it has transformed people and businesses all over the world. Now, in this wildly entertaining and informative diagnosis and prescription, he narrows down the singular virus sickening the four most influential aspects in our lives: the people around us, our education system, business, and government. The illness rotting them all out can be blamed on people ignoring their core values.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;That&#39;s personal, and Larry goes there and then some, and that&#39;s why countless people have been converted into followers by watching him on television as he regularly appears on varied news programs and by buying enough of his books to put him on the &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Wall Street Journal&lt;/i&gt; bestseller lists. His shocking opinions and belly-laughing honesty all come unfiltered. If he offends you—good! You&#39;re engaged and really thinking about what&#39;s important to you. This single resource enables you to:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;Take real action to improve what&#39;s wrong with your business, family, and life.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Get advice you can understand from a non-stop powerhouse coach.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;What&#39;s Wrong with Damn Near Everything!&lt;/i&gt; tells you all the simple truths to troubleshooting everyday problems in life and business.&lt;/p&gt;" />
