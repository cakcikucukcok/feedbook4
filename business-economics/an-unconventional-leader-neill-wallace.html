  <title>An Unconventional Leader - Neill Wallace</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;We all have the ability to push aside accepted conventions to revolutionize the way we view modern leadership and become exceptional leaders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Neill Wallace looks back at his own personal and workplace experiences. Inspired by other leaders - from polar explorers to contemporary businesspeople - Neill gives a straightforward view on how you can truly get to know, understand, and inspire your team members.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By taking an unconventional approach to leadership, youll be able to:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Determine the type of leader you are and learn how you can effectively use your natural style to put people first.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Empower yourself to make positive changes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hire and promote people best suited for the job.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Increase employee engagement by allowing them to contribute more to the organization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If youve never quite fit the mold, prefer the freedom of being outside the box, believe that everyone can contribute to an organizations success, then this guidebook is for you. While you may have to disturb the status quo, you will find engaging your team and achieving goals easier when you apply the lessons of An Unconventional Leader.&lt;/p&gt;" />

From learning how to let go of workplace fears to taking a people-first management approach, you will feel empowered to take charge of your career, make positive changes for yourself and your team, and become a proactive contributor to your organization.<br /><b><i>An Unconventional Leader: Wallace, Neill: 9781480810228 ...</i></b> | Applying his experience in business as an “unconventional leader,” debut author Wallace offers his insightful personal perspective in a book that is as much about a life philosophy as leadership. Wallace begins with a discussion of typical business leadership, suggesting that leaders tend to follow convention largely because things have always been done the same way: “Today many of us just accept that the leadership pathway is not only unchallengeable but also unchangeable.”<br /><b><i>AN UNCONVENTIONAL LEADER by Neill Wallace | Kirkus Reviews</i></b> | The Paperback of the An Unconventional Leader by Neill Wallace at Barnes &amp; Noble.
