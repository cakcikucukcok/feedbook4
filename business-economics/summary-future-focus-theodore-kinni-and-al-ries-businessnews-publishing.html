  <title>Summary: Future Focus - Theodore Kinni and Al Ries - BusinessNews Publishing</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This work offers a summary of the book “FUTURE FOCUS: How 21 Companies AreCapturing 21st Century Success” by Theodore Kinni and Al Ries.In Future Focus, Theodore Kinni and Al Ries raise an essential question: What are the ingredients of 21st century corporate success? It is reasonable to assume those companies which have succeeded in the past will be the best positioned to continue that success into the next century. In other words, the most likely corporate success stories of the next century are the companies that achieved the most in the last century. Therefore, the starting point for predicting the future is to analyze which companies did best in the last century. Using four quantitative criteria (revenue growth, profit growth, increase in market capitalization and growth in globalization) and four qualitative criteria (marketing innovation, technological innovation, degree of focus and future prospects), a short list of 21 companies was developed.In Future Focus, the authors reveal the four qualities these 21 success stories of the last century have in common. They explain the reader how to learn and profit from their example. A brilliant guide for business owners and executives." />
