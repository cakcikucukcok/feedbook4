  <title>How to Lose Your Shirt Starting a Mail Order Business - Joseph Lanciotti</title>
      <meta name="description" content="From his own experiences in starting a small mail order business, the 
author has written this important, basic book. He has included some of the 
critical problems he encountered and overcame. During the difficult times 
when he made mistakes, he chose to accept it with good humor and as a 
learning experience which he passes on to the reader.&lt;/p&gt;
    He does not promise, &#39;to make you a millionaire&#39;, however, he explains 
how the mistakes he made could make you lose your shirt if you repeat them.&lt;/p&gt;
    He tells you about his successes and his failures with a few tears and a 
little boasting, and he warns you that losing your shirt can be very painful. 
The guidance he offers should prevent you from repeating some of the serious 
mistakes that he made.&lt;/p&gt;
    Starting small, with a tight budget, and little knowledge about the mail 
order business, the author developed press releases and advertising that sold 
many products including plastic spouts and orange peelers, garlic that had no 
odor, fake alarm panels, and books. A very popular product, The Seat Bag, was 
sold to thousands of Bird Watchers, Artists and other customers around the 
world.&lt;/p&gt;
    His press releases were used by The New York Times, other large 
newspapers, and the Associated Press. How he did this and who he met along 
the way will make you laugh as you learn." />
