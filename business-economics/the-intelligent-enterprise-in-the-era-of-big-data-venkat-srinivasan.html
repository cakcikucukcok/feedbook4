  <title>The Intelligent Enterprise in the Era of Big Data - Venkat Srinivasan</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;“ … the enterprise of today has changed … wherever you sit in this new corporation … Srinivasan gives us a practical and provocative guide for rethinking our business process … calling us all to action around rapid development of our old, hierarchical structures into flexible customer centric competitive force …. A must read for today’s business leader.” &lt;b&gt;Mark Nunnelly&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Executive Director, MassIT, &lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;Commonwealth of Massachusetts and Managing Director, Bain Capital&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“’Efficiency,’ ‘agile,’ and ‘analytics’ used to be the rage. Venkat Srinivasan explains in this provocative book why organizations can no longer afford to stop there. They need to move beyond – to be ‘intelligent.’ It isn’t just theory. He’s done it.” &lt;b&gt;Bharat Anand&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Henry R. Byers Professor of Business Administration, Harvard Business School&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In the era of big data and automation, the book presents a cutting-edge approach to how enterprises should organize and function. Striking a practical balance between theory and practice, &lt;i&gt;The Intelligent&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;Enterprise in the Era of Big Data &lt;/i&gt;presents the enterprise architecture that identifies the power of the emerging technology environment.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Beginning with an introduction to the key challenges that enterprises face, the book systematically outlines modern enterprise architecture through a detailed discussion of the inseparable elements of such architecture: efficiency, flexibility, and intelligence. This architecture enables rapid responses to market needs by sensing important developments in internal and external environments in real time. Illustrating all of these elements in an integrated fashion, &lt;i&gt;The Intelligent Enterprise in the Era of Big Data&lt;/i&gt; also features:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;• A detailed discussion on issues of time-to-market and flexibility with respect to enterprise application technology&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;• Novel analyses illustrated through extensive real-world case studies to help readers better understand the applicability of the architecture and concepts&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;• Various applications of natural language processing to real-world business transactions&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;• Practical approaches for designing and building intelligent enterprises&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Intelligent Enterprise in the Era of Big Data &lt;/i&gt;is an appropriate reference for business executives, information technology professionals, data scientists, and management consultants. The book is also an excellent supplementary textbook for upper-undergraduate and graduate-level courses in business intelligence, data mining, big data, and business process automation.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“a compelling vision of the next generation of organization—the intelligent enterprise—which will leverage not just big data but also unstructured text and artificial intelligence to optimize internal processes in real time … a must-read book for CEOs and CTOs in all industries.” &lt;b&gt;Ravi Ramamurti&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;i&gt;D”Amore-McKim Distinguished Professor of International Business and Strategy, &lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;and Director, Center for Emerging Markets, Northeastern University&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/i&gt;“It is about the brave new world that narrows the gap between technology and business …. The book has practical advice from a thoughtful practitioner. Intelligent automation will be a competitive strength in the future. Will your company be ready?” &lt;b&gt;Victor J.
