  <title>A Pirate Captain&#39;s Guide to Leadership - Doug Heatherly</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Every workplace has them&lt;/em&gt;. Employees with bad attitudes. People who ignore the rules. Rude and insubordinate workers. Individuals who put forth little or no effort, produce substandard output, and yet &lt;em&gt;still&lt;/em&gt; expect everything in your organization to revolve around &lt;em&gt;them&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;#39;ve attempted to &lt;em&gt;manage&lt;/em&gt; these people, you already know it can be a frustrating, time-consuming, and wholly ineffective endeavor. &lt;em&gt;Leading&lt;/em&gt; them is the only real solution. &lt;em&gt;A Pirate Captain&amp;#39;s Guide to Leadership&lt;/em&gt; gives you the power to turn &amp;ldquo;workplace pirates&amp;rdquo; into motivated and productive employees.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is not a &amp;quot;gimmick&amp;quot; book that rehashes the same old superficial philosophies. It&amp;#39;s a definitive &amp;quot;how to&amp;quot; manual for today&amp;#39;s supervisors and managers. The parallel between the Golden Age of Piracy and the modern American workplace provides an entertaining metaphor, but within each of the book&amp;#39;s eight major sections are clear and concise chapters that explain exactly what to do and how to do it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With more than 30 years of hands-on leadership experience, author Doug Heatherly focuses on the &lt;em&gt;practical&lt;/em&gt; aspects of employee development. He offers a proven set of leadership skills that you can apply &lt;em&gt;today&lt;/em&gt; &amp;ndash; not only with &amp;quot;workplace pirates,&amp;quot; but with every employee (ALL workers respond to effective leadership).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The well-organized structure makes it an ideal learning tool for newly-appointed supervisors, as well as an indispensable quick reference for experienced managers at any level. The techniques and examples are applicable in business, government, education, and non-profit organizations - anywhere that motivation, discipline, proficiency, commitment, teamwork, and &lt;em&gt;results&lt;/em&gt; are important&lt;/p&gt;" />
