  <title>Enterprise Mobile Device Management Complete Self-Assessment Guide - Gerardus Blokdyk</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Are there any easy-to-implement alternatives to Enterprise Mobile Device Management? Sometimes other solutions are available that do not require the cost implications of a full-blown project? What are the compelling business reasons for embarking on Enterprise Mobile Device Management? How are the Enterprise Mobile Device Management&#39;s objectives aligned to the organization’s overall business strategy? What other areas of the organization might benefit from the Enterprise Mobile Device Management team’s improvements, knowledge, and learning? How would one define Enterprise Mobile Device Management leadership? 
&lt;p&gt;
Defining, designing, creating, and implementing a process to solve a business challenge or meet a business objective is the most valuable role… In EVERY company, organization and department.
&lt;p&gt;
Unless you are talking a one-time, single-use project within a business, there should be a process. Whether that process is managed and implemented by humans, AI, or a combination of the two, it needs to be designed by someone with a complex enough perspective to ask the right questions. Someone capable of asking the right questions and step back and say, &#39;What are we really trying to accomplish here? And is there a different way to look at it?&#39;
&lt;p&gt;
For more than twenty years, The Art of Service&#39;s Self-Assessments empower people who can do just that - whether their title is marketer, entrepreneur, manager, salesperson, consultant, business process manager, executive assistant, IT Manager, CxO etc... - they are the people who rule the future. They are people who watch the process as it happens, and ask the right questions to make the process work better.
