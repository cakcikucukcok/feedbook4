  <title>From the Cowshed to the Kop. My Autobiography - Peter Cormack</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;Described by the late, great Bill Shankly as &amp;amp;#145;the final piece in the jigsaw&amp;amp;#8217; of his now famous Liverpool side of the 1970s, Peter Cormack is one of the most successful footballers of his generation, winning both domestic and European honours at club level and playing for his country nine times. Regarded as a legend by fans of both Hibernian and Liverpool, Peter&amp;amp;#8217;s playing career also included spells with Nottingham Forest and Bristol City before he moved into football management. From the Cowshed to the Kop is a compelling account of a career spanning almost forty years. As soon as he joined Hibernian as a teenager, his quality shone through, and amongst his 99-goal tally was Hibs&amp;amp;#8217; first in a glamour-friendly against a world-class Real Madrid side, which included Hungarian talisman Ferenc Pusk&amp;amp;#225;s. He also starred in the famous Napoli game where Hibs beat the Italian giants 5&amp;amp;#150;0 at Easter Road to overturn a seemingly impossible 4&amp;amp;#150;1 deficit. After a two-year spell in the English First Division with Nottingham Forest, Bill Shankly made his move and signed Cormack for Liverpool for a club record equaling fee of &amp;amp;#163;110,000. He soon established himself as a key part of one of the greatest footballing sides of all time and won two League Championships, an FA Cup medal and two UEFA Cup medals before injury forced him out of the team. These were the glory days at the start of Liverpool&amp;amp;#8217;s dominance of domestic and European football, and Peter Cormack played his part in that incredible success story. Having played with and against some of the greatest names in football, Peter Cormack&amp;amp;#8217;s remarkable story is told with honesty and humour, and provides a unique and fascinating insight into one of football&amp;amp;#8217;s golden eras.&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;" />
