  <title>LeadershipFlow Perfectly Square - Croft Edwards</title>
      <meta name="description" content="How many times have you read a book about leadership but the next day couldn’t remember, let alone apply, any of the concepts to your real life? Today is a new day. In LeadershipFlow | Perfectly Square, Master Certified Coach and Leadership Expert Croft Edwards finds a fresh way to look at personal and organizational change through his story of a family-owned business and its struggle to survive. Infusing his proven methodology into the narrative and characters, he provides readers with a dynamic roadmap for how to lead and transform a company and access the keys to leadership for themselves. Jackie Andrews, a former junior military officer, has come home to co-run Perfectly Square, her family’s woodworking supply company, that has struggled to thrive in the aftermath of the death of its founder, Jackie’s father. Jackie quickly realizes that the status quo is not sustainable as the company seeks its direction and growth under both her leadership and that of her brother Mark, a reluctant CEO. Croft’s page-turning journey will enliven the reader with new insights into leadership and how to tap the great potential within us all - the ultimate state of performance known as Flow. As the story unfolds, Croft’s principles and techniques regarding transformational change and the study of LeadershipFlow are brought to life through real world interactions. These principles can be used to build high performing organizations, but also to create transformational change inside each leader. A lively and entertaining read, with a powerful, yet user-friendly message for leaders everywhere." />
