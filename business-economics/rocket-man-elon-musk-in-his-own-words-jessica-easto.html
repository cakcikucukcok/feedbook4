  <title>Rocket Man: Elon Musk In His Own Words - Jessica Easto</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;Elon Musk, the South African&amp;#150;born entrepreneur who made his first fortune with Internet companies such as PayPal, has risen to global prominence as the visionary CEO of both Tesla Motors and SpaceX, two companies with self-proclaimed missions to improve life as we know it and better secure the future of humanity.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;For the first time, the most insightful, thought-provoking, and revealing quotes from this entrepreneurial engineer have been compiled into a single book. &lt;I&gt;Rocket Man: Elon Musk In His Own Words&lt;/I&gt; is a comprehensive guide to the inner workings of the man dubbed &quot;the real Tony Stark.&quot; Hundreds of his best quotes, comprising thoughts on business, clean energy, innovation, engineering, technology, space, electric vehicles, entrepreneurship, life lessons, and more, provide an intimate and direct look into Silicon Valley&#39;s most ambitious industrialist.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Even with no prior experience in the complex, ultra-high-barrier-of-entry automotive and space industries, Musk has excelled. Tesla, the first successful American car startup in more than 90 years, received more than 325,000 reservations for its economical Model 3 in a single week&amp;#151;advancing the company&amp;#8217;s cause to &amp;#147;accelerate the advent of sustainable transport&amp;#8221; via affordable, reliable electric vehicles. SpaceX, the first private company to launch, orbit, and recover a rocket and dock at the International Space Station, has drastically reduced the cost of launching and manufacturing reusable spacecraft, which the company sees as the first step toward its &quot;ultimate goal&quot; of making life multiplanetary. In the words of Richard Branson, &quot;Whatever skeptics have said can&amp;#8217;t be done, Elon has gone out and made real.&quot;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;How could a young man who at one time seemed like &quot;just&quot; another Internet entrepreneur have gone on to build two highly disruptive companies and innovate technologies related to everything from electric batteries to rocket manufacturing? There&#39;s no better way to learn than through his own words.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;This book curates Musk quotes from interviews, public appearances, online postings, company blogs, press releases, and more. What emerges is a &#39;word portrait&#39; of the man whose companies&#39; swift rise to the top will undoubtedly keep their status-quo competitors scrambling to keep up.&lt;/div&gt;" />
