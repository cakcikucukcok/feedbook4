  <title>The Financial Shepherd - Ii and Sy Pugh, Glen Wright</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Have you ever wondered why some people have SO much money, and why others have so little? What makes the super-rich any different from you? For anyone who has ever wondered what the difference is between the haves and the have-nots, you may have just found your answer. Regardless of how much money you have or dont have, the journey to financial success begins with understanding and accepting how you think about money, how you feel about money, and what you know about money. Once you achieve a realistic assessment of where you are financially, there are specific steps and proven strategies that can propel you toward accomplishing positive financial goals and securing financial freedom.
Dollars + Change = Sense is the equation for financial success. This subtitle is based on the idea that it makes sense to change your old financial habits if you arent in a desirable financial position or if youd like to improve your current financial situation and maximize opportunities to increase wealth. The Dollars represent your current assets and liabilities, financial strengths and weaknesses, and other tools and resources that can be used to implement a good financial plan. Change represents your attitude and willingness to learn new information and apply new methods of financial management taught or demonstrated by professionals in the financial arena. Sense implies a reliable ability to judge and make good decisions as a result of training, maturity, and experience. Prepare to abandon old habits and adopt a new way of thinking about money. It is time to take control of your finances and embrace savvy new ways to spend, save, and invest in your financial future.
If you browse the shelves at any library or bookstore, you will see there are many books written on finance. Some are written from a Christian perspective, some deal with feelings about spending and emotional attachments to money, others deal primarily with financial terminology and the technical aspects of money management. Many purport to be how to books that teach the reader tricks of the trade and how to get rich quick. But this book is designed to help readers identify real problems in their own finances and to provide real solutions that work.
Throughout the entire book, you will be given guidelines for completing a basic financial assessment, understanding key financial terms, identifying a reputable financial planner, working with licensed professionals and counselors, developing and following a financial plan, achieving long-term investment, retirement and estate planning goals, and discovering Gods ultimate financial plan for your life. It may be useful to highlight specific terms or concepts, take notes in the margins, and re-read certain sections to make sure you not only read the information, but comprehend it as well. Realize that undergoing a financial transformation not only takes skill, but it also takes time. Making a commitment to understand, adjust, and improve your financial habits is one of the most important investments you will ever make, and it is guaranteed to offer a good return.
The Financial Shepherd will help lead you up the path of financial recovery or down the road toward financial independence." />
