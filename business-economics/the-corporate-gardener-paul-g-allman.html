  <title>The Corporate Gardener - Paul G. Allman</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Mr. Allman has written his book utilizing the power and simplicity of a good story designed to be very
informative yet easy to read addressing the following issues:&lt;p&gt;
CHANGING WORK DEMOGRAPHICS&lt;br&gt;
As the experience of seasoned managers begins to disappear from corporate America, the objective is to provide a useful tool to encourage in-depth exploration of management theories. Written with a market focus of first time managers, this book could also be used as an excellent refresher for more experienced managers struggling with mentoring less experienced staff members.&lt;p&gt;
ECONOMY&lt;br&gt;
Predictions of our current economy indicate years of continued financial challenges. Corporations will
focus more and more on cost-cutting measures, improvement and efficiency efforts reminiscent of the last similar economic cycle beginning in the early 1990s.&lt;p&gt;
EFFECTIVE WORK TEAMS&lt;br&gt;
Cooperation, timely communication, efficient processes and on-going skill development are key
components of successful organizations. The focus of corporations has become how to maximize
employee contributions and minimize unnecessary constraints on productivity." />
