      <meta name="description" content="The American University of Avezzano, Italy, must create a curriculum that promotes physical education. Its geographic location makes it an ideal place to help a variety of people of different nationalities.
If done correctly, a focus of this kind would establish an American school of physical education, health, recreation, camping, and outdoor activity, thus improving quality of life for both students and the community in general. In this scholarly work, author Aspr Surd provides
	insights on strategy and organizational structure based on comparative physical education programs;
	details on the functions studied and how administrators at American schools integrate physical education into curriculums;
	information from surveys of American colleges and universities in the East and Midwest that provide strategies on how to organize such a campus.
By studying innovation in an array of curriculums, schools throughout Italy can change their daily routines and help their students. Studying the forms and methods implemented in the creation of a new school points to urgent needs and compelling opportunities both inside and outside centers of learning." />
