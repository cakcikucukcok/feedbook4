  <title>The Century Bhoys - Paul Cuddihy, David Friel</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;Since Celtic&amp;amp;#8217;s formation in 1888, a total of seven hundred and seventy seven players have represented the club at first-team level and by the end of season 2007/08, Celtic had scored 10,883 competitive goals. However, just twenty-eight players have managed to score more than 100 competitive goals for Celtic throughout those 120 years. Century Bhoys celebrates each of these twenty-eight players, from the first player to hit 100 goals, Sandy McMahon (1890-1903), to the greatest goalscorer of all time, Jimmy McGrory with an incredible 468 goals in 445 appearances. It&amp;amp;#8217;s an incredible list featuring famous Lisbon Lions such as Stevie Chalmers and Bobby Lennox and modern greats such as Brian McClair, Charlie Nicholas, John Hartson and, of course, the legendary Henrik Larsson, who scored 242 goals in 315 games during a seven-year period with the club. Each chapter focuses on an individual player, looking at their playing career with Celtic, with particular focus on their first goal, their 100th goal, the final goal as well as the highs and lows of their time at the club and one or two quirky and not widely known facts. Entertaining and informative, Century Bhoys is full of facts and anecdotes about the greatest goalscorers in the history of Celtic FC. &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;" />
