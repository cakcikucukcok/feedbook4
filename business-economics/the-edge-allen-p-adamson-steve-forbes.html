      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;In the digital age, the old rules of marketing and branding are in desperate need of overhaul. Word of mouth has evolved to word of type as customers promote or deride products and services to a massive Internet audience at a moments notice. Any misstep away from the brand message  becomes a catastrophe as companies are no longer afforded the luxury of tweaking their message as a commercial, ad, or story develops, resulting in damage control that not only costs the brand money, but also costs customer support, hurting a brand&#39;s image and integrity. &lt;br&gt;In &lt;i&gt;The Edge&lt;/i&gt;, Allen Adamson examines how the leading brands of today maintain their dominance in the market utilizing the strategies put forth in his previous books&lt;i&gt; BrandSimple&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;BrandDigital&lt;/i&gt;.   Adamson succinctly accounts specific challenges facing the biggest brands of today, from major companies like Apple and General Mills to celebrity brands like Lady Gaga and Jay Z. He reveals the guiding principles employed to ensure the message stays focused, remains clear, and continues to drive a brand to the top of the market.&lt;/p&gt;" />
