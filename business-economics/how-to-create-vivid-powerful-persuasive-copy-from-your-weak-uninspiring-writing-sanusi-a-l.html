  <title>How to Create Vivid &amp; Powerful Persuasive Copy From Your Weak &amp; Uninspiring Writing - Sanusi A. L.</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Have you been wasting thousands of dollars this 2019 and getting poor results from your marketing effort?&lt;br /&gt;
Are you a marketer or a business owner who finds it very difficult to sell a product or service?&lt;br /&gt;
Have you been finding it difficult to write vivid and powerful persuasive copy that will make people take the action you want?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
If you answered yes to any of the above questions, then cry no more because I can help you!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
You just can&amp;#39;t afford to waste any more money, more time, and more energy after trying so hard and still failing! I don&amp;#39;t know what it is about marketing that makes everyone on earth seems to think they can do it.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
You see, with over 10 years of constant success in marketing various great products and services for my clients, and also from my relationship with other marketers, I can easily tell you why many marketers are not successful. Most of the time, it&amp;#39;s got nothing to do with the quality of their products or services.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Now, if your product or service is of very high quality, but your sales are still very poor, it must have been because of one or more of the following reasons:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
1. You are simply an untrained marketer or have little or no experience in marketing.&lt;br /&gt;
2. You are unable to convince people enough to take action or buy your product or service because you just can&amp;#39;t create vivid and powerful persuasive copy that will make your readers or listeners to not only visualise your writing in their minds but also see, smell, hear, touch and even taste it!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
However, your audience taking action is key in marketing because ACTION = SALES.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
3. You do not know how to make your marketing exciting enough for your audience (and more fun for you to write).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
You do not know&amp;nbsp;how to grab them by their eyeballs and steal their attention away from your competitors.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The good news is that this book has been written to change all that. This book is a very rare opportunity for you to learn how to engage and convince people to buy your product or service.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I have poured in numerous examples to teach you step by step how to use imagery to make your reader or audience to understand exactly what you&amp;#39;re talking about, remember it, and take action (for example by buying your product or service).&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
My book was written from a combination of my online and offline marketing experience. I created this educative&amp;nbsp;book and made it very short so that you can consume&amp;nbsp; the content very quickly.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
It is filled with clear screenshots and steps you should take to learn how to effectively capture the attention of your readers,&amp;nbsp;keep it, and persuade them to take action.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Are you thinking I&amp;#39;m done? No not yet!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I&amp;#39;ve taken the extra giant step to provide you after-sales support so that you can contact me directly if you need further help in creating persuasive copy. This is to ensure you succeed very fast in your marketing business.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
So don&amp;#39;t procrastinate. Order my book right now, and let&amp;#39;s walk together through the very simple process of creating&amp;nbsp; content that will not only engage&amp;nbsp;your audience and customers, but will also make them pay and thank you for your&amp;nbsp;quality product or service!&lt;br /&gt;
