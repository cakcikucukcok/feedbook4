  <title>Daring to succed - Guy Gendron</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The exceptional, winding path of a man who is inseparable from the empire he built
Combining a tobacconist, newstand, food mart, beer shop and general store, the convenience store has undergone many trans­formations over the last 35 years, ever since a man decided to turn it into his life&#39;s business. That man is Alain Bouchard. Strangely, few people know his name, even in Quebec, where he lives. He is, however, one of Canada&#39;s wealthiest entrepreneurs, as well as one of the most peer-honoured businessmen in the world.
    Starting as a volunteer clerk in his brother&#39;s business before doing all the tasks related to this often thankless work, Alain Bouchard is truly a self-made man who climbed through the professional ranks. Today, the multinational Alimentation Couche-Tard Inc. empire that he founded encompasses Circle K, comprises 12,000 stores and over 100,000 employees. It posts revenues of almost US $35 billion.
    What is the recipe for this kind of success? What values drive this entrepreneur and his loyal collaborators? This book provides an unprecedented look into an extraordinary business and a man who put it all on the line to win.   
Currently Radio-Canada&#39;s ombudsman, Guy Gendron was a television journalist for over 35 years, notably in Toronto, Ottawa, Washington and Paris. The two-time winner of the Judith-Jasmin prize and twice named recipient of the Caisse de Dépôt et Placement du Québec-Bank of America Merrill Lynch Economic and Financial Journalism Awards of Excellence also taught journalism at Université du Québec à Montréal. He wrote Brian Mulroney&#39;s political biography in 2014." />
