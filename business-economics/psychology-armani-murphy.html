      <meta name="description" content="&lt;b&gt;Have you ever wanted to influence someone into thinking the way you do? Do you wish you could take control of a conversation to manipulate the outcome? Are you ready to &lt;u&gt;discover what it takes to master dark psychology and use NLP techniques to your advantage&lt;/u&gt;?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Most people when learning about dark psychology skim over the top and just do a handful of different things to influence and manipulate others. This is not that kind of book! This book is all about getting deep with different laws of manipulation to ALWAYS succeed at whatever you are trying to accomplish. It&amp;rsquo;s all about controlling the actions and thoughts of the person you are interacting with to either persuade them to accept your call to action, or to side with you in a debate.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Politicians know these laws. Leaders know these laws. Now you are going to learn the laws of manipulation so you can always gain the upper hand and take control. It&amp;rsquo;s easy to learn them and to put them into everyday practice. And there are enough laws of dark psychology that you can pick and choose which ones are going to best suit your situation and goals in life. That&amp;rsquo;s the best part! This book is completely customizable. And that&amp;#39;s what you&amp;#39;ll learn in &lt;i&gt;Psychology: Techniques in Dark Psychology, Manipulation, Influence with Persuasion, NLP &amp;amp; Mind Control&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;
