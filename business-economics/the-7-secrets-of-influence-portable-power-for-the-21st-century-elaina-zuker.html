  <title>The 7 Secrets of Influence: Portable Power for the 21st Century - Elaina Zuker</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Ms. Zuker&#39;s unique theory of the &quot;Secrets of Influence&quot; is the result of studying the Influence Strategies of hundreds of managers and executives in companies in the U.S., Canada and internationally. Combining academic discipline with her years of practical business experience, she created the unique &quot;Secrets of Influence Styles Inventory&quot; and her elegant but simple step-by-step system for building on one&#39;s existing Influence skills and formulating a personal Influence Strategy (details of the statistical studies are in the appendix of the eBook).  This highly practical guide, filled with realistic advice on succeeding in today&#39;s unpredictable business and social climates, enables the reader to learn the skills needed to persuade the boss to try a new idea or approach, to influence subordinates to work together more productively, or to induce a school or community group to adopt - or defeat - a proposal.  Identifying and explaining the basic influence styles, the author tells how to determine one&#39;s natural style and, even more important, how to develop better &quot;radar&quot; to detect the influence styles of others. Understanding that we all must interact with many different types of people in both business and social settings, in addition to the new media we are all using, these techniques allow us to exert more influence in all our relationships.  Given such realities, Zuker demonstrates which style is most effective for accomplishing varying goals: creating a common vision, establishing trust, fostering an atmosphere conductive to an open exchange of ideas or a rational discussion of hard data, encouraging creative and innovative solutions to problems, or motivating unimaginative or recalcitrant people.  The Seven Secrets of Influence is filled with vital Information on such topics as how to use verbal and nonverbal clues to create instant rapport, gain credibility with others, motivate cautious people, overcome the problems caused by overlapping or unclear authority, and gain the support of key decision makers for important projects  Powerful and practical, this eBook is essential reading for any manager or communicator in today&#39;s tough business climate." />
