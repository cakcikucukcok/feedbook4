  <title>The General Theory of Rapid Economic Development - Shivaji Lokam</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;How can the many Low-income countries around the World rapidly develop and transform into high-income? Why didn&amp;rsquo;t they develop until now?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After pouring millions and millions of dollars into decades of research, the mainstream economists and their theories have nothing to show. Many countries have failed in trying to develop. In the 1990s, even at a very early age Author Shivaji Lokam could see his home country India also, burdened with overpopulation and severe shortages, had failed to develop. Despite the admirable recent success, India remains a low-income country.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After investing three-years in painstaking research, the Author has achieved a breakthrough. He has developed the two general laws of rapid economic development &amp;ndash; the first anytime and anywhere. &lt;em&gt;The General Theory of Rapid Economic Development&lt;/em&gt; is a book that at once successfully uncovers the miracle behind the greatest improvement in living standards in the shortest time anywhere in the World in South Korea, Taiwan, and China. The Theory and the Mechanisms in the book show the developing countries of today how to replicate those same or even better outcomes and transform into high-income nations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Author explores in the book the historical cases in the US, UK, France, and Germany; considers the cases of a wide array of other countries as Saudi Arabia, Malaysia, and Japan; unpacks the industrialization of China unlike anywhere; unmasks for the first time the non-industrialization route of development of Chile and Botswana; and takes up the case of India as an Application of the theory.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Packed with more than hundred neatly presented graphs and flowcharts, fifty newly defined or redefined economic terms, and an opening Chapter to help readers to whom the topic is novel, the book&amp;rsquo;s breadth, and depth unmatched anywhere as it weaves through such multiple subjects as economics, business, and technology, banking, history including history of economics, science and engineering. Well researched and vastly original, the book upends the thinking behind the more than two-hundred-year-old economics discipline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unlike any other economics book, &lt;em&gt;The General Theory&lt;/em&gt; is easy to understand and is written not exclusively for the economic profession but especially for financial journalists, policymakers, businesses executives, entrepreneurs, students of economics, concerned citizens, general readers, etc.&lt;/p&gt;" />
