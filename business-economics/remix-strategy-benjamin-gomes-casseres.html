  <title>Remix Strategy - Benjamin Gomes-Casseres</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;&lt;B&gt;How to Create Joint Value&lt;/B&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;br&gt;Alliances, partnerships, acquisitions, mergers, and joint ventures are no longer the exception in most businesses&amp;#151;they are part of the core strategy. As managers look to external partners for resources and capabilities, they need a practical roadmap to ensure that these relationships will create value for their firm. They must answer questions like these: Which business combinations do we need? How should we govern them? Will their results justify our investments?&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Benjamin Gomes-Casseres explains how companies create value by &amp;#147;remixing&amp;#8221; resources with other companies. Based on decades of consulting and academic research, &lt;I&gt;Remix Strategy&lt;/I&gt; shows how three laws shape the success of any business combination:&lt;BR&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;#149;  First Law: The combination must have the potential to create more value than the parties could create on their own. &lt;I&gt;Which elements from each business need to be combined to create joint value?&lt;/I&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&amp;#149;  Second Law: The combination must be designed and managed to realize the joint value. &lt;I&gt;Which partners best fit our strategic goals? How should we manage the integration?&lt;/I&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&amp;#149;  Third Law: The value earned by the parties must motivate them to contribute to the collaboration. &lt;I&gt;How will we share the joint value created? Will the returns shift over time?&lt;/I&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;br&gt;Supported by examples from a wide range of industries and companies, and filled with practical tools for applying the three laws, this book helps managers design and lead a coherent strategy for creating joint value with outside partners.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/div&gt;" />
