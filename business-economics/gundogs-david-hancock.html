  <title>Gundogs - David Hancock</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;This book is about gundogs, those ever-willing companions of both sportsmen and discerning dog owners. Gundogs is not a manual covering training, grooming, nutrition and dog care; it is very much a celebration of the gundog&#39;s contribution to the sporting and companion dog scene, an examination of their past, their performance and their prospects in an increasingly urban society. Painstakingly researched, it covers the well-known recognized breeds and the more obscure ones from overseas, some quite unknown to the British public.David Hancock&#39;s earlier books have been highly praised, as have his many articles in sporting magazine in the last thirty years. When reviewing one of his previous books, the revered writer on sporting dogs, the late Brian Plummer, described it as a &#39;masterpiece&#39;. Reviewing his Sporting Terriers, Dogs in Canada magazine stated that it &#39;has the quality of a classic&#39;. A reviewer of his last book, Sighthounds, stated that &#39;Hancock&#39;s work provokes thinking in the reader the way a good discussion stimulates and refreshes our minds.&#39; A Canadian reviewer of another of his books gave the view that David Hancock is &#39;perhaps the most important living writer about dogs.&#39; A comprehensive survey of the gundog&#39;s origins, its role and its future, Gundogs is essential reading for all those with an interest in these loyal dogs, especially gundog and country sport enthusiasts. Meticiously researched and packed with information it covers the well-known recognized breeds as well as more obscure ones. Superbly illustrated with 360 colour and black &amp;amp; white photographs. David Hancock has studied dogs for over half a century and is a past winner of the Dog Writers Association of America.&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;" />
