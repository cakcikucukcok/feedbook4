  <title>What&#39;s Your Digital Business Model? - Peter Weill, Stephanie Woerner</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;What is &lt;i&gt;your&lt;/i&gt; digital business model? While many leaders of companies recognize the threat from digital--and the potential opportunity--they lack a common language or a compelling framework to help them assess it and, more importantly, to direct them. They don&#39;t know how to think about their digital business model. In this probing and practical book, Peter Weill and Stephanie Woerner provide much-needed tools, self-assessments, motivating examples, and key financial analyses of where the profits will likely be made.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Based on five years of study at the MIT Center for Information Systems Research, the book provides a powerful yet simple framework that has been field-tested globally with more than a dozen senior management teams. The authors found that digitization is moving companies&#39; business models on two dimensions: from value chains to digital ecosystems, and from a fuzzy understanding of the needs of end customers to a sharper one. Looking at these dimensions in combination results in four distinct business models, each with different capabilities: (1) Supplier, (2) Omni-channel, (3) Modular Producer, and (4) Ecosystem Driver. The framework helps companies clarify where they are currently in an increasingly digital business landscape and highlights what&#39;s needed to move toward another, higher-value digital business model.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In meeting the growing challenge to &quot;go digital,&quot; this smart book will help you grapple with the threats, respond to the opportunities, and create winning digital strategies.&lt;/p&gt;" />
