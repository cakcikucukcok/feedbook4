      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A &lt;em&gt;Wall Street Journal &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;Financial Times&lt;/em&gt; book of the month&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Millennials have become the largest generation in the U.S. workforce, and Generation Z workers are right behind them. Leaders and organizations must embrace the new ways of working that appeal to the digital-first generations, while continuing to appeal to Baby Boomers and Generation X, who will likely remain in the workforce for decades to come.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Within any organization, team, meeting, or marketing opportunity, you will likely find any combination of generations, each with their own attitudes, expectations, and professional styles. To lead and succeed in business today, you must adjust to how Millennials work, continue to accommodate experienced colleagues and pay attention to the next generations coming up. &lt;em&gt;The Remix&lt;/em&gt; shows you how to adapt and win through proven strategies that serve all generations&amp;#8217; needs. The result is a workplace that blends the best of each generation&amp;#8217;s ideas and practices to design a smarter, more inclusive work environment for everyone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a leading expert on the multigenerational workplace, Lindsey Pollak combines the most recent data with her own original research, as well as detailed case studies from Fortune 500 companies and other top organizations. Pollak outlines the ways businesses, executives, mid-level managers, employees, and entrepreneurs can tackle situations that may arise when diverse styles clash and provides clear strategies to turn generational diversity into business opportunity. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Generational change is impacting all industries, all types of organizations, and all leaders. &lt;em&gt;The Remix&lt;/em&gt; is an essential guide for anyone looking to navigate today&amp;#8217;s multigenerational workplace, which is more diverse and varied than ever before.&lt;/p&gt;" />
