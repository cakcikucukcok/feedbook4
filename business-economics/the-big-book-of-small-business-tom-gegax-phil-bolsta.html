  <title>The Big Book of Small Business - Tom Gegax, Phil Bolsta</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Your shoes are charred from stomping out brush fires. You have nightmares about UFOs&amp;#8212;Unreachable Financial Objectives. All-star interviewees turn into duds. Meetings cause more problems than they solve. The office is a ghost town at 5:01 p.m. Does this sound familiar? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tom Gegax knows what that is like. Years after running his Tires Plus franchise by the seat of his pants, blissfully unaware of how little he knew about getting the most out of people and managing a world-class organization, Tom was faced with a cancer diagnosis and a business at the brink of disaster. Resolved to change things around, he improved his mental clarity, health, and relationships and noticed that the more he profited on a personal level, the more his &lt;em&gt;company&lt;/em&gt; profited. Tires Plus grew into a $200 million business with 150 upscale locations. He had learned the first lesson in Enlightened Leadership 101: Focus on the well-being of your employees and customers&amp;#8212;as well as your own&amp;#8212;and success will follow naturally.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In &lt;em&gt;The Big Book of Small Business&lt;/em&gt;, Tom shares his hard-earned lessons on how to become an enlightened, effective leader, and on how to do the small things right so the big decisions work. This all-in-one toolbox for small businesses is jammed with warm-hearted, tough-minded practices and street-smart tips, covering every aspect of a growing business: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Starting, funding, and getting your new business off the ground&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Crafting a mission and growing a corporate culture that works&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Hiring the best people and maximizing their potential&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Communicating and negotiating with your employees, customers, and suppliers&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Creating processes for continuous innovation and growth&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Protecting your business from unforeseen dangers&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Planning for growth &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;And much more . . .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;As thorough as a textbook and as lively as a news magazine, &lt;em&gt;The Big Book of Small Business&lt;/em&gt; is the most comprehensive and practical book on how to take a small business to the next level, and an indispensable slingshot for the millions of scrappy Davids taking on corporate Goliaths.&lt;/p&gt;" />
