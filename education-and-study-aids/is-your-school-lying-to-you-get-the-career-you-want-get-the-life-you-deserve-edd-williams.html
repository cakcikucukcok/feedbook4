      <meta name="description" content="The world is changing. Education is changing, but careers and university advice isn&#39;t, and more than that it hasn&#39;t for the last 30 years. The teachers we are entrusting with our children&#39;s futures lack the essential skills and experience to competently advise them - a view that is also held by employers, Ofsted, The Department for Education, The Sutton Trust, and other think-tanks. Is Your School Lying to You? Get The Career You Want. Get The Life You Deserve. is the complete, comprehensive &#39;how to&#39; academic and careers guide aimed at every student considering their options. It is for anyone who is struggling with their decisions, those who want some clear advice about what they should be doing and when, or those who know exactly what they want but aren&#39;t sure how to go about it. In fact, it&#39;s aimed at every student who cares about their future. This book offers real world insights about how to identify what you really want from your life, how to plot your academic journey and its impact on your career prospects, how to write your personal statement or CV, advice from successful people from a variety of industries, best practice for interviews, work experience, internships and a host of other critical skills to help achieve your goals - even if you don&#39;t know what those goals might yet be." />
