  <title>The Learning Curve - Erica Baker</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Why do you want to teach those kids? How can I connect with students that do not want to learn? Why challenge this group if they will never understand the content? These are three common questions asked of and by educators of culturally and linguistically diverse (CLD) students. The Learning Curve is a guide to aid new and veteran educators, and anyone working closely with CLD students, with engagement strategies. This guide features an analysis of federal legislation, the Taylor System, and school models that work such as Christopher Emdin&amp;#39;s 5C Model. In the age of growing diversity and inclusion, now is the time to dismantle the School-to-Prison Pipeline and establish a cultural framework to support CLD students inside and outside of the classroom.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Erica R. Baker is an alternative educator with experience in Washington, D.C. and Atlanta Public Schools. She holds an M.Ed in Curriculum and Instruction with a specialization in Educating for Change from Trinity Washington University. Baker prides herself in being extremely vocal about race relations, education, and equity in the United States. Currently, Baker resides in Stone Mountain, Ga. In her spare time, she loves to spend time with her family and dog, Chloey.&lt;/p&gt;" />
