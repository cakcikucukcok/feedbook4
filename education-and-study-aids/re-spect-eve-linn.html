  <title>Re-Spect - Eve Linn</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Something is just not right these days. Its like were out of alignment with our core values and have lost respect for  &lt;b&gt;respect&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Through a detailed exploration of what respect means, how we experience it (and how we process its absence), author Eve Linn invites readers to consider the holistic impact of this societal paradigm shift. Has respect for family members, friends, and strangersnot to mention the selfbecome an endangered quality in humanity? In addition, is the lack of respect for the property and dignity of others a symptom of a deeper, more insidious disease afflicting humanity?&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Linn suggests that the recent worldwide protests against corporate greed may in fact be a conscious or subconscious contemporary response to this apparent loss of respect. She investigates this theory as she reviews the development of postWorld War II pluralistic economic societies and other significant developments of the area of industrialization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By exploring these ideas, Linn, a psychotherapist, has come to the conclusion that we have lost respect in general during our past journey from preindustrial times to pluralistic economic societies. She also questions the fact of more aggressive behaviors in our societies in light of the recent, increasingly disastrous behaviors of Mother Nature, considering this coincidence from a metaphysical level of understanding us as a human species in the world in which we live.&lt;/p&gt;" />
