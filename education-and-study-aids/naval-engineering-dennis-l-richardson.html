  <title>Naval Engineering - Dennis L. Richardson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Naval Engineering: Principles and Theory of Gas Turbine Engines is a technical publication for professional engineers to assist in understanding the history and development of gas turbine engines including the thermodynamic processes known as the Brayton cycle. Common principles of various gas turbine nomenclatures, technical designs, applications, and performance conditions that affect the capabilities and limitations of marine operations are provided. It enables the ability to describe the principal components of gas turbines and their construction.
This book will enable the reader to increase professional knowledge through the understanding of navy engineering principles and theory of gas turbine engines. The reader will learn the operation and maintenance of the gas turbine modules (GTMs), gas turbine generators (GTGs), reduction gears, and associated equipment such as pumps, valves, oil purifiers, heat exchangers, shafts, and shaft bearings. Inside this book, you will find technical information such as electronic control circuitry, interfaces such as signal conditioners, control consoles, and designated electrical equipment associated with shipboard propulsion and electrical powergenerating plants. When every detail of engineering work is performed with integrity and reliability, technical leadership know-how will improve." />
