As students engage in meaningful work and deepen their knowledge of a specific topic, teachers gain insight into best instructional practices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Through photographs and classroom examples, former curriculum director, teacher, and museum educator Linda D&#39;Acquisto shows how school museums inspire students&#39; curiosity and creativity; encourage responsibility and teamwork; and strengthen writing, communication, research, and problem-solving skills. You will learn the process for developing your own exhibition, including strategies for&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;* incorporating academic content standards&lt;/br&gt;&lt;br&gt;* assessing learning and understanding&lt;/br&gt;&lt;br&gt;* guiding research, writing, and design&lt;/br&gt;&lt;br&gt;* promoting partnerships among students, colleagues, parents, and the community&lt;/br&gt;&lt;br&gt;* using the completed museum as a teaching tool&lt;/br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With its step-by-step approach and practical resources, &lt;i&gt;Learning on Display&lt;/i&gt; will help you transform your curriculum into motivating museum projects that make class work rigorous, memorable, and fun.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Note: This product listing is for the reflowable (ePub) version of the book.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />
