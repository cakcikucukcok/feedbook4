	Readers will find insightful discussions of the challenges Continuing Education enterprises face in the years ahead and difference between administration and leadership.  Also included is an in-depth presentation of management theory and techniques and marketing concepts as they apply to higher education. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
	The books extraordinary contribution is a wealth of detailed information on the specifics of creating a thriving Continuing Education program.
