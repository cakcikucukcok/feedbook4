  <title>Applications of Public Health Education and Health Promotion Interventions - Rashid M Ansari</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Although there have been many significant advances in health care over the years, there are still issues demanding the attention of health-care professionals, governments, and individuals. Among them are chronic diseases and problems, such as type 2 diabetes, smoking, lack of physical activity, and dietary issues.
In Applications of Public Health Education and Health Promotion Interventions, author Rashid Ansari highlights the practical applications of public health education and health promotion in various settings in addressing those health issues in particular and other health problems in general. He also provides health education concepts and processes that provide a combination of approaches to lifestyle change in order to assist individuals, families, and communities in making informed decisions on matters that affect the restoration, achievement, and maintenance of their health. 
A combination of health education and health promotion interventions at the primary level of prevention can be used to facilitate behavioural and environmental changes conducive to health enhancement. Ansari also shows how health inequality among populations can be reduced. 
Applications of Public Health Education and Health Promotion Interventions provides practical information on how public health theories and hypotheses can be used to combat some of the most prevalent health-care issues of the day." />
