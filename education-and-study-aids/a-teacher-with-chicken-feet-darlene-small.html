  <title>A Teacher with Chicken Feet! - Darlene Small</title>
      <meta name="description" content="I AM NOT LOOKING FOR THE BEST SELLER, BUT I AM HOPING FOR THE BEST RESULTS. I COME OUT A FAMILY OF 12, OF WHICH MY FATHER WOULD SAY IT WAS CHEAPER BY THE DOZEN. HOWEVER, THAT WAS A LONG TIME AGO NOT IN TODAYS TIME.
YES WE HAD A GREAT TIME GROWING UP TOGETHER, BUT IN TODAY IN WHICH WE LIVE, WE TOO HAVE SOME CONFLICT,BUT WE LOVE EACH OTHER. WE ALL HAVE SOME CONFLICT. NEVERTHELESS, IF WE DONT SIT DOWN OR FIND SOME TIME TO SOLVE OR AGREE TO DISAGREE, CONFLICT CAN ESCALATE.
ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS ASKED FAMILIES WHO HAVE LOST LOVE ONES FROM JOB SHOOTINGS, DOMESTIC SHOOTINGS AND SCHOOL SHOOTINGS. THE LIST COULD GO ON AND ON.
I HOPE THE QUOTES AND POEMS WILL HELP CHANGE A LIFE. WE WILL HAVE LESS GRAVES IF WE PASS THIS FORWARD. LET THE CHANGE START WITH YOU.
THANKS TO MY PARENTS, MY BROTHERS, JAMES, MAC, CHARLES, JESSES,EZEKIEL AND ISAAC MITCHELL. THANKS TO MY SISTERS, ARLENE,
JACQUELENE, CARLENE, CHARLENE AND ELENE, AND TO ALL MY BROTHER-IN-LAWS, SISTER-IN-LAWS, NEPHEWS, NIECES, COUSINS, FRIENDS AND IF I HAVE ANY EMEMIES OUT THERE I LOVE YOU TOO." />
