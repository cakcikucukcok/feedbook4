  <title>Up, Up, and Away - Dr. Mary Moore Nance</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;A Synopsis of Materials and Teaching Process:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Values-based stories, grades 522, three stories each level, address interest categories of adventure, biography, children/family, church history/religion, cross-cultural stories, history, problems/challenges, human relations, and missions. The first class session offers an inventory of each students reading experience, interests, and felt needs. Students indicate story preferences within the categorized stories. A graded story list aids teacher planning. In daily free class discussion, students use questions generated while reading and the thought questions provided with each story. Appendix C: The Daily Class Discussion Assignment helps thinking flow. The teacher assigns the Final Written Reflection for that days story and begins process on the subsequent story.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Nance did not see a truck driver who could not read or write wellshe saw potential.  I cannot really comment on the technical side of what she did, and I cannot tell you how or what she didbut whatever it wasit obviously worked. She transformed a truck driver who had done little reading into someone who finished his bachelors, masters, and has now completed a doctoral degree!  What I do know is that her kind spirit and gentle encouragement spurred me onwards toward a thirst for reading and learning all I can.  The simple reality is this: the work Dr. Mary Nance has done  works! I am living proof!&lt;br /&gt;
