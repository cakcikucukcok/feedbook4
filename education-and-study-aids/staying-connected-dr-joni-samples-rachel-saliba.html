  <title>Staying Connected - Dr. Joni Samples, Rachel Saliba</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Staying Connected is a journey of discovery for parents of children who are about to begin school or who are already on their journey through education. 
Rachel encourages parents to discover where learning happens and shares stories of the school experience from a parent perspective. Her helpful advice draws from real life stories of parenting children as they make their way through their education. Truly connecting with children and their learning is at the heart of the book as Rachel encourages us to explore our own connection with ourselves to enable that special relationship between parent and child to continue once they begin school. 
The book is a helpful tool, a guide for practice with examples of how-tos. Although its geared for parents, as a teacher, I would find it very helpful, especially for the kinds of conversations I might have with both parents and children. It also provides wonderful ideas that a teacher can pass on to a parent about talking with and encouraging a child. Some of the best gems in this book are near the end; Rachel writes, The gift of connection with our children can never truly be found unless we connect with ourselves first.
