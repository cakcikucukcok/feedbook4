  <title>Seasons of Poetry - Jan Bowcut</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Seasons of Poetry is a delightful journey through the year with vivid, stylized images, and engaging poems,
that stand on their own. But it doesn&#39;t end there. Its lessons present an introduction to writing poetry, and an
overview of poetic forms and traits. Based on Six-Trait Writing, and supportive of state standards for
literature, it provides guidelines for beginning writers of any age to create depth, and poetic skill within their
poems. The author&#39;s &quot;voice&quot; comes through her writing, inspiring even the most reluctant writer to discover
the poet within; while self-driven writers will be off and running on their own.
Some of the ideas presented in Seasons of Poetry are:
	Rhyming vs verse
	Figurative language
	Irony and juxtaposition
	Meter
	Repetition
	Sensory imagery
	Evoking strong emotion
	Aspects of a poets life
	Breaking conventions or using them in an unusual way
	White space, subtitles, and line breaks
	Glossary of terms
Teachers and students alike, will find this multi-faceted book the perfect combination to inspire new poets.
Bowcut says, &quot;It&#39;s an all-in-one course tied with a bow ... all you provide is the ribbon&quot;." />
