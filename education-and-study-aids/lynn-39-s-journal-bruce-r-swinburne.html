  <title>Lynn&#39;s Journal - Bruce R. Swinburne</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;LYNNS JOURNAL&lt;br /&gt;
THE THIRD BOOK IN A TRILOGY&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lynn Bosen grew up in a trailer park. Her father abused her until he died when Lynn was nine years old. Her mother was a recluse, showing little interest or affection for Lynn. Lynn grew up with three survival qualities. She could run like the wind, she had a powerful mind, and she had a beautiful body. Boys and men were drawn to her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lynn is now Lynn Bosen Noble. Her husband, Mike Noble, is a graduate professor and vice president of Great Rivers University (GRU). Mike Noble has studied in diverse academic fields including studies of writing and healing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Stem: Cells That Divide, Lynn was left for dead in an explosion meant to kill her and to destroy the Stem Cell Laboratory on the campus of GRU. She survived and Mike encouraged her to write of her life in a journal, thus, Lynns Journal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lynn takes on the task with little enthusiasm; however, she addresses the challenge and she enjoys the process. You will respect her courage and her survival skills. She has trepidation about sharing it with Mike.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is her unexpurgated journal, or as some are wont to say, warts and all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Enjoy!&lt;br /&gt;
