  <title>Survival Skills for the New Elementary Teacher - Jeannette M. Konior</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;
Every year thousands of new teachers graduate, all hoping to obtain their dream job in the school district of their choice. They have been given a great education at their respective universitites. In addition to the usual academics, they have learned educational theory, development, lesson planning, methodology, etc. But, very few learn about the more practical side of education in the classroom - &lt;i&gt;the tricks of the trade&lt;/i&gt;. Student teaching provides an opportunity to learn some of these things; however, not all circumstances come up in one or two experiences. In most cases, the new teacher enters the work force a true novice whose confidence is shaken when it becomes obvious how much is not known.
&lt;P&gt;
This book concentrates on elementary education. Here you will find answers to questions you may have asked on classroom management, discipline, organization, testing and grading, talking to parents, and much more. The teacher is the catalyst who puts all these things in motion. The teacher as classroom leader must be decisive, compassionate, ready, clear and to the point, and above all, professional.
