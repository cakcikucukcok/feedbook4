  <title>Connecting High-Quality Educators with Urban Students - Sharon Hartin Iorio</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Recent national attention has focused on the benefits of school-university-community partnerships to increase the pipeline of highly qualified teachers for urban students, but little has been published about large-scale partnerships. This book about one urban teacher education partnership is written for those who want to plan, direct, work in, or study a full-scale, pre-K-12 school, university, and community partnership.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;The book offers a comprehensive approach to urban teacher education. Topics cover (1) recruitment; (2) a large-scale Professional Development School model (e.g. 400 candidates per semester) and an early childhood residency graduate program (20 candidates per cohort)&amp;mdash;two partnership programs embracing all university preservice teacher candidates; (3) induction support for new teachers, and finally, (4) professional development for candidates and experienced, in-service teachers.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Each of the six chapters show how the separate parts of teacher education can be interrelated to build a stronger, more cohesive, integrated system to serve teachers and ultimately Pre-K-12 students. A review and reflection on a single teacher education partnership, this easy-to-use book, is clearly documented by interviews, five-year evaluation outcomes, and a retrospective analysis that embraces sociocultural themes.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;" />
