  <title>Ajax Penumbra 1969 - Robin Sloan</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;From Robin Sloan, author of &lt;/i&gt;Mr. Penumbra&#39;s 24-Hour Bookstore, &lt;i&gt;the story of Mr. Penumbra&#39;s first trip to San Francisco--and of how he got entangled with the city&#39;s most unusual always-open enterprise...&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is August 1969. The Summer of Love is a fading memory. The streets of San Francisco pulse to the sounds of Led Zeppelin and Marvin Gaye. And of jackhammers: A futuristic pyramid of a skyscraper is rising a few blocks from City Lights bookstore and an unprecedented subway tunnel is being built under the bay. Meanwhile, south of the city, orchards are quickly giving way to a brand-new industry built on silicon.&lt;br&gt;But young Ajax Penumbra has not arrived in San Francisco looking for free love or a glimpse of the technological future. He is seeking a book--the single surviving copy of the&lt;i&gt; Techne Tycheon&lt;/i&gt;, a mysterious volume that has brought and lost great fortune for anyone who has owned it. The last record of the book locates it in the San Francisco of more than a century earlier, and on that scant bit of evidence, Penumbra&#39;s university has dispatched him west to acquire it for their library. After a few weeks of rigorous hunting, Penumbra feels no closer to his goal than when he started. But late one night, after another day of dispiriting dead ends, he stumbles across a 24-hour bookstore, and the possibilities before him expand exponentially . . .&lt;/p&gt;" />
