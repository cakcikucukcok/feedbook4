  <title>Fertilizer For The Funnybone - Gary Guest</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;DISCLAIMER: The views represented in this book are not necessarily the views of the United States Department of Agriculture. BUT THEY SHOULD BE! In the increasingly competitive and challenging world of farming, surely a book is needed to educate farmers on how to increase their crop yields. Okay, so this isn&amp;rsquo;t that book. Or&amp;hellip;is it? What if what every farmer really needs is just a good laugh?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gary Guest or &amp;ldquo;Double G&amp;rdquo; as he&amp;rsquo;s known, loves three things: 1. Being a farmer; 2. Dirt; and 3. Making people laugh. In &lt;em&gt;Fertilizer For The Funnybone&lt;/em&gt;, he&amp;rsquo;s fulfilled that mission in sowing a collection of humorous anecdotes, poems, and witty one-liners sure to reap a bountiful harvest of laughter. Guest also loves his wife of 40 years who plays a prominent role in the book, as well as serving as his &amp;ldquo;typist, editor, conscience and sometimes waitress.&amp;rdquo; Whether you&amp;rsquo;re a lifetime farmer or a city-slicker, you&amp;rsquo;re sure to love this book and the author &amp;rsquo;s infectious and delightful brand of self-deprecating humor. From &amp;ldquo;Me a writer? That might be a stretch&amp;rdquo; to &amp;ldquo;You might be a Cattleman if&amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo; to the &amp;ldquo;Dear Double G&amp;rdquo; not so sage advice columns, this book lives up to its name!&lt;/p&gt;" />
