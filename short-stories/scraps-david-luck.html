  <title>Scraps - David Luck</title>
      <meta name="description" content="From slice-of-life vignettes to narratives with suspense, the short stories in author David Lucks fiction collection stem from his observations of life around him. After moving from an isolated mountain cabin to a home near Sloans Lake in Denver, Colorado, Luck was intrigued by the activity surrounding the lake. Luck used these situations as fodder for this book. &lt;p&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Scraps&lt;/i&gt; first story, Angelica and Carlos, introduces the young Angelica as she waits for her son to be returned from a weekend visit with his father, Carlos. When Carlos and Roberto are more than an hour late, Angelica wonders if she will ever see her son again. In Balby, England, an American couple, married for forty-one years, travel to England for the first time and become the unwitting targets of a beautiful thief. Going Postal tells the tale of Maggie, a homeless woman; Jasper, a retired gentleman who has taken up in-line skating; and Merna, a cantankerous mail carrier; and how their lives intersect in an unusual way.&lt;p&gt;
Infused with sensory images woven with beautiful language, the stories in the collection give a glimpse into situations, people, and places with which we can all identify." />
