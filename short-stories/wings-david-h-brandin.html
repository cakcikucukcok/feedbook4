  <title>Wings - David H. Brandin</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;David Brandin loves tales that end with an unusual twist. In his collection of thirty-eight flash fiction stories, he cleverly intertwines satire with political incorrectness to deliver one of-a-kind political, historical, science fiction, and fantasy tales that each come to a surprising conclusion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Divided into four sections, Brandins stories begin by exploring political scheming as a president struggles with a church sermon on the seven deadly sins; a poorly qualified candidate defends his nomination to an ambassadorship; and asylum is claimed under unusual circumstances. As Brandin continues into historical and fantasy tales, eclectic characters are brought to the forefront as a statistics professor attempts to beat the odds on airplane bombs; an attempt is made to reengineer the wings of chickens; Chicago politicians struggle with a plan to reduce gang warfare; and a robot wonders whether sex is possible. In his final section, Brandin chronicles the life story of a small boy cursed by Lord Shiva.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wings is a collection of unique short stories that delivers satire, humor, and surprise endings as a group of wide-ranging personalities try to overcome lifes most challenging obstacles.&lt;/p&gt;" />
