  <title>A Long December - Richard Chizmar</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;In 1996, Richard Chizmar&#39;s debut short story collection, &lt;i&gt;Midnight Promises&lt;/i&gt;, was a finalist for the World Fantasy Award. &lt;i&gt;Publishers Weekly&lt;/i&gt; called it &quot;a sterling collection&quot; while singling out &quot;The Silence of Sorrow&quot; as &quot;an understated masterpiece.&quot;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Two years later, Subterranean Press published a mini-collection from Chizmar entitled &lt;i&gt;Monsters and Other Stories&lt;/i&gt;. In his introduction, acclaimed genre critic Edward Bryant said, &quot;When all is said and done, this book should leave you in utter silence, giving you time and opportunity to contemplate what you just read. Tough storytelling from a tough writer; but a writer who is not calloused. Chizmar possesses a finely honed gift of empathy. With utter grace and loving kindness he&#39;ll put you right inside the life (and soul) of the monster.&quot;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Now, nearly two decades later, Chizmar assembles thirty-five stories, including a previously-unpublished novella, and presents us with &lt;i&gt;A Long December&lt;/i&gt;. This massive new collection features more than 150,000 words of Chizmar&#39;s very best short fiction and includes 8,000 words of autobiographical Story Notes.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Eerie, suspenseful, poignant, the stories in &lt;i&gt;A Long December&lt;/i&gt; range from horror to suspense, crime to dark fantasy, mainstream to mystery.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;As New York Times bestselling author Scott Smith (&lt;i&gt;A Simple Plan&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;The Ruins&lt;/i&gt;) notes: &quot;It&#39;s an idyllic little world Richard Chizmar has created. Boys fish in the shallows of a winding creek. A father tosses a baseball with his young son in the fading light of a summer day. There&#39;s the smell of fresh-cut grass. And then, well...just beneath the surface? There are those missing pets whose collars turn up in a shoebox. Or the disturbing photos the dead can leave behind. Or the terrible thing you might find yourself doing when a long lost brother suddenly returns, demanding money. Chizmar does a tremendous job of peeling back his world&#39;s shiny layers, revealing the rot that lies underneath. His stories feel like so many teeth: short and sharp and ready to draw blood.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;" />
