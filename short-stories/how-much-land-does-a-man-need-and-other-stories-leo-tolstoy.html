  <title>How Much Land Does a Man Need? and Other Stories - Leo Tolstoy</title>
      <meta name="description" content="In this collection, &quot;How Much Land Does a Man Need? And Other Stories,&quot; Russian born Leo Tolstoy (1828-1910) demonstrates his varied subject matter and style in his shorter fiction. In the title piece, &quot;How Much Land Does a Man Need?,&quot; Tolstoy explores this very question through the story of a peasant with an increasing appetite for land. In &quot;What Men Live By,&quot; the humble shoemaker Simon sets out to collect money to pay for new coats for the family. &quot;A Spark Neglected Burns the House&quot; is a parable examining the process of reconciliation. Also included are &quot;Two Hussars,&quot; &quot;Where Love is,&quot; &quot;God Is,&quot; &quot;Two Old Men,&quot; and &quot;A Prisoner in the Caucasus,&quot; some of Tolstoy&#39;s finest early work. Though Tolstoy is widely known for &quot;War and Peace&quot; and &quot;Anna Karenina,&quot; considered two of the greatest novels in world literature, his short stories remain valuable classics in their own regards." />
