  <title>The Little Ho! Ho! Book - Ron Drain</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Ho! Ho! Ho!  Ho! Ho! Ho!  Ho! Ho! Ho! Ho! Ho!  &lt;p&gt;Welcome to Volume 1 of &lt;i&gt;The Little Ho! Ho! Book&lt;/i&gt;. (Referred to in familiar circles as the &lt;i&gt;T.L.H.H.B.&lt;/i&gt;) This is a compilation of twelve of the Fans Favorite Holiday Columns that ran in years past throughout the Midwestern United States in the weekly humor column &quot;And...More, Later.&quot; Simple, eh?
&lt;p&gt;Well...not quite that simple. For this Holiday Gift Book is much more than just your average compilation. In this its finest hour, it represents the extremely hard work of several individuals who felt strongly enough about this project to devote an enormous amount of Time, Patience, and Support to it. Its purpose is twofold: to bring attention to a devastating condition, Alzheimers, which is affecting our aging population on an ever-increasing basis, and secondly to generate a non-typical source of revenue to the local chapter responsible for increasing the publics awareness of this serious illness.
&lt;p&gt;The authors and artistic contributors are receiving no monetary remuneration for their efforts. In fact, 100%...again, thats 100%...of the royalties generated by the sales of this small effort will be paid directly to the Heartland Chapter of the Alzheimers Association, the charity selected to benefit from this first edition of &lt;i&gt;T.L.H.H.B.&lt;/i&gt; Hopefully, this is just the first of many such volumes that will continue to benefit this particular charity as well as several other worthy organizations in future years.
&lt;p&gt;On behalf of everyone who contributed their energy to this endeavor...Thanks, our appreciation, and Happy Holidays." />
