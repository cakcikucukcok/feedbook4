  <title>13 Views of the Suicide Woods - Bracken MacLeod</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;&amp;#147;Bracken MacLeod writes dark, human stories of horror and modern noir. Absolutely one of the brightest stars of the next generation!&amp;#8221;&lt;BR&gt;&amp;#151;Christopher Golden, New York Times bestselling author of &lt;i&gt;Snowblind&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Ararat&lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;p&gt;From the author of Mountain Home and Stranded, comes Bracken MacLeod&amp;#8217;s first collection of short stories.&lt;br&gt;&lt;BR&gt;These stories inhabit the dark places where pain and resignation intersect, and the fear of a quiet moment alone is as terrifying as the unseen thing watching from behind the treeline. In the titular story, a young woman waits for her father to come home from the place where no one goes intending to return. A single word is the push that may break a man and save a life. The members of a winemaking community celebrate the old time religion found flowing in the blood of the vine. A desperate man seeking a miracle cure gets more than a peek behind the curtain of Dr. Morningstar&amp;#8217;s Psychic Surgery. A child who dreams of escaping on leather wings finds rescue in dark water instead. Looking back over a life, a homeless veteran must decide to live in the present if he wants to save his future. In a Halloween Hell house, a youth pastor must face the judgment of a man committed to doing the Lord&amp;#8217;s work. Fiery death heralds the beginning of a new life. A man who has been carrying pain with him his entire life gives up his last piece of darkness. And a still day beneath the sun illuminates the quiet sorrow of the last feather to fall.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;B&gt;Bracken MacLeod&lt;/B&gt; is the author of &lt;I&gt;Mountain Home, White Knight&lt;/I&gt;, and, most recently, &lt;I&gt;Stranded&lt;/I&gt;, which has been optioned by Warner Horizon Television. He lives in New England with his wife and son.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;" />
