  <title>River Child - Eleanor Millard</title>
      <meta name="description" content="River Child is a collection of nineteen linked short stories set in the magnificent Klondike in the famous gold rush town of Dawson City, Yukon Territory. The book explores questions of cross-cultural relationships, personal identity, and the strength of First Nations&#39; commitment to the family through three generations. Dave Maclean is a White man from Saskatchewan who lives with Maggie, a First Nation woman in Moosehide, the native village close to Dawson City. Maggie dies from tuberculosis. Their child, Eliza, is sent to an abusive residential school hundreds of miles away. Eliza runs away to come back home, and eventually gives birth to Selena whom she leaves to be cared for by Dave. Much of the book explores the personal and social conflicts experienced by Eliza and Selena while Dave observes his child and grandchild becoming alcoholic. Several unique characters influence the life of the Maclean family, including Selena&#39;s grandmother, her best friend, her father, her brothers, and her boyfriend. While the overall story is realistically sombre, it is always hopeful." />
