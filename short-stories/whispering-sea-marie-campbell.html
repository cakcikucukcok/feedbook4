      <meta name="description" content="The story is about a young child, Serena wandering the countryside with her father. So poor that sometimes she had to go around in barefoot. Eventually they were befriended by a kind old shop owner who gave them an old house on the beach. There they found contentment but Serena always longed to find out about her past.
Mighty Ocean where have you been
what wonderous things have you seen
that sun kissed land with beaches white
the frozen shores no sun did light
Such change of mood
Such depth untold
what many stories could unfold
We remember not its angry roar
white tipped spray rising high
but listen very quietly as
it reaches the shore it whispering gently
after its mighty journey
