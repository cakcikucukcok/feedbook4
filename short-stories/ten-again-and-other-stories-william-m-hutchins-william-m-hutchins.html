  <title>Ten Again and Other Stories - William M. Hutchins, William M. Hutchins</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Ibrahim al-Mazini was one of the great humorists and stylists of twentieth-century Arabic prose literature. Like an Egyptian James Thurber, he captured the foibles and triumphs of Cairo&#39;s middle classes of the 1930s and 1940s in exceptionally stylish prose. This collection gathers in one volume some of al-Mazini&#39;s best short fiction, including two novellas: &lt;em&gt;Midu and His Accomplices&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Ten Again&lt;/em&gt;. Midu is an engaging, well-liked army officer who assisted by almost every other character in the story arranges a faux heist from his uncle&#39;s library in order to allow young love to run its course.  In &lt;em&gt;Ten Again&lt;/em&gt;, a man awakes to find that he has returned to childhood, on the day of his tenth birthday: his wife, who is being wooed by a most obnoxious suitor, is now his mother, and his two sons torment him mercilessly at his birthday party. In al-Mazini&#39;s skillful hands, the short stories included here illuminate a lively fictional world: from a drunken encounter with a parrot to an undertaker&#39;s attempt to provide a cadaver with a believer&#39;s contented smile. An unmarried woman dreams of her unborn daughter, who is impatient to be born; and a reclusive author who has chosen to disappear from Cairo&#39;s literary scene is tracked down to his obvious disgust by an intrepid researcher. Rich in insight, imagination, and humor, these stories are a splendid introduction to a major figure in the early generation of Egyptian writers." />
