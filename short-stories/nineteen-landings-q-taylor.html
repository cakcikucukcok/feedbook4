&lt;p&gt;After a thumping noise awakens a man in his house, he and his cat spring out of bed to investigate. Whoever it is, whatever it is, he is prepared to face it. But when he finds nothing, he returns to bedonly to be awakened again by footsteps. Now he is left wondering if what he hears is all in his imagination or real. As another man falls asleep next to his future wife, a dark figure with a machete in hand meets him in his dreams. He thinks it is just a nightmare, until he wakes up. Jake Lawnmeyer, a hard-working father of two, will do anything to make his boys happy, including climbing an old mountain.
