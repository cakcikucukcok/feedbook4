A mysterious tech conference brings a writer to Montreal, where he discovers new designs on the past in &amp;#8220;How It Used to Be.&amp;#8221; A grandfather&amp;#8217;s Yiddish letters expose a love affair and a wartime secret in &amp;#8220;Little Rooster.&amp;#8221; In &amp;#8220;Childhood,&amp;#8221; Mark&amp;#8217;s concern about his son&amp;#8217;s phobias evokes a shameful incident from his own adolescence. In &amp;#8220;Roman&amp;#8217;s Song,&amp;#8221; Roman&amp;#8217;s desire to help a new immigrant brings him into contact with a sordid underworld. At his father&amp;#8217;s request, Victor returns to Riga, the city of his birth, where his loyalties are tested by the man he might have been in &amp;#8220;A New Gravestone for an Old Grave.&amp;#8221; And, in the noir-inspired &amp;#8220;The Russian Riviera,&amp;#8221; Kostya leaves Russia to pursue a boxing career only to find himself working as a doorman in a garish nightclub in the Toronto suburbs. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In these deeply felt, slyly humorous stories, Bezmozgis pleads no special causes but presents immigrant characters with all their contradictions and complexities, their earnest and divided hearts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;#160;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;#160;" />
