  <title>Mindwarp, a Novella - Richard Hebert</title>
      <meta name="description" content="MindWarp has been named to Kirkus Reviews&#39; &quot;Best of 2011&quot; list. The Florida Writers Association also awarded the title novella its top prize for short fiction in the 2011 Royal Palm Literary Award competition.
In this award-winning collection of short fiction, a deranged author turns a barroom buddy into his fictional foil as he warps his own and the friends reality beyond recognitionan ageless man sits on a rock in the desert on Yom Kippur waiting for a goat to be brought to hima shanty-town child saves and befriends a crippled rabbit hit by a speeding car, only to face the impersonal cruelty of modern lifea woman rides a bus in silence to her family homestead once a year, concealing her personal mystery from the bus attendant, a neighbor who grew up in her sheltering shadowa shell-shocked war veteran waits beside railroad tracks each day for his tormentor to pass
Kirkus, which bills itself as &quot;The World&#39;s Toughest Book Critic,&quot; describes the work as a scintillating collection(that) uses offbeat character studies to wrestle with snaky issues of identity and self-knowledge. Quirky, opaque figures abound. (T)he quality of (Hberts) prose, his deadpan realism, mordant wit and acute powers of description ground his flights of abstraction in the soil of experience. A beguiling blend of high-concept narrative and old-school literary chops.
