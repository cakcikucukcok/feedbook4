  <title>Probably Monsters - Ray Cluley</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Dark, weird, literary horror stories-quintessential ChiZine material. This title comes from a little girl called Isabella  who discovered a hole in the carpet and promptly asked how it got there. Ray didn&#39;t know. So she produced her own answer, delivered with the straight simplicity only childhood allows: &quot;Probably monsters.&quot; This book answers similarly. Sometimes the monsters are bloodsucking fiends with fleshy wings or shambling dead things that won&#39;t rest. Other times they&#39;re creatures red in tooth and claw.  And sometimes they&#39;re people, people like me and you and sometimes they&#39;re things these people are scared of or don&#39;t understand, things that make us howl in the darkness, often hoping no one hears. Despite what our parents may have told us, there are such things as monsters. Lots of them. We discover that quickly, growing up.&lt;/p&gt;" />
