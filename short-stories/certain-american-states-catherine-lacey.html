  <title>Certain American States - Catherine Lacey</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;One of &lt;i&gt;The Wall Street Journal&lt;/i&gt;&#39;s Best Short Story Collections of 2018. Named a Summer Read by &lt;i&gt;Vanity Fair, The Guardian,&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;Nylon, Bustle &lt;/i&gt;and&lt;i&gt; Literary Hub. &lt;/i&gt;One of &lt;i&gt;Financial Times &lt;/i&gt;and &lt;i&gt;TLS&lt;/i&gt;&#39;s Best Books of 2018.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;One of &lt;i&gt;Granta&lt;/i&gt;&#39;s Best Young American novelists, Catherine Lacey, the Whiting Award-winning author of &lt;i&gt;The Answers&lt;/i&gt;, showcases her literary style in short fiction with &lt;i&gt;Certain American States&lt;/i&gt;, a collection of stories about ordinary people seeking--and failing to find--the extraordinary in their lives.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Catherine Lacey brings her narrative mastery to &lt;i&gt;Certain American States&lt;/i&gt;, her first collection of short stories. As with her acclaimed novels &lt;i&gt;Nobody Is Ever Missing&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;The Answers&lt;/i&gt;, she gives life to a group of subtly complex, instantly memorable characters whose searches for love, struggles with grief, and tentative journeys into the minutiae of the human condition are simultaneously gripping and devastating. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The characters in &lt;i&gt;Certain American States&lt;/i&gt; are continually coming to terms with their place in the world, and how to adapt to that place, before change inevitably returns. A woman leaves her dead husband&#39;s clothing on the street, only for it to reappear on the body of a stranger; a man reads his ex-wife&#39;s short story and neurotically contemplates whether it is about him; a young woman whose Texan mother insists on moving to New York City with her has her daily attempts to get over a family tragedy interrupted by a mute stranger showing her incoherent messages on his phone. These are stories of breakups, abandonment, and strained family ties; dead brothers and distant surrogate fathers; loneliness, happenstance, starting over, and learning to let go. Lacey&#39;s elegiac and inspired prose is at its full power in this collection, further establishing her as one of the singular literary voices of her generation.&lt;/p&gt;" />
