  <title>The Dream Journal of Amanda J. Wilde - Savanna Redman</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;They come in in threes&amp;hellip; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When I was a child I dreamed of my funeral, three nights in a row, each dream more vivid and real than the last. I was there, a spirit hiding behind the honeysuckle, watching the mourners. Too young they said. Only thirty-two.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I turned thirty-two on Christmas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have tried to brush it off, label it as a childish fear&amp;hellip; but I know better. There is a difference between a nightmare and a premonition. This was no nightmare. And so far, my premonition dreams always come true.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Against the odds, I&amp;rsquo;ve managed to create a normal life for myself. I&amp;rsquo;m married. We have a charming home. Life is good.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s been a long time since I&amp;rsquo;ve sleepwalked or been woken up by the ghost, years in fact. But in August, in the predawn hours under the old oak tree in the back yard, I was awakened by my childhood ghost pulling me from the sticky webs of another premonition. I don&amp;rsquo;t dream pretty: but this one was exactly that: butterflies and paint, rainforest and moss... a different life: a different time: a different me. It&amp;rsquo;s confusing because premonition dreams never lie.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, with the clock on The Year of My Death ticking loudly in my head and the nightmares returning, I worry the end is near. I started this dream journal to help untwist the dangerous symbolism buried deep in my dreams. Read it if you wish, these might be the last words I ever write.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My biggest fear now is simple; will I make it to thirty-three?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Dream Journal of Amanda J. Wilde is a collection of dreams, short stories that follow Amanda&amp;rsquo;s life in Butterfly Bones, share in her thoughts, fears, and discoveries as she explores her premonition dreams, the world where nightmares have a life of their own.&lt;/p&gt;" />
