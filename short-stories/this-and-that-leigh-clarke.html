  <title>This and That - Leigh Clarke</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Herman Melville, author of &lt;i&gt;Moby Dick,&lt;/i&gt; never thought of himself as a writer. He was an adventurer, learning how to write by learning how to live. Author Leigh Clark takes the same approach. Although she does have some formal training in the art, she feels writing is more than putting words on the page; it is instead a search for knowledge that enhances the way we live and look at the world around us.
In &lt;i&gt;This and That,&lt;/i&gt; Clarke takes everyday observations and makes them beautiful through the telling of eloquent short stories. She reinvents the famous first line of Melvilles masterwork with the line Call me Moby Dick in Another Point of View. She explores the painful process of job hunting in The Interview. And take a stop by the peaceful sea in Clarkes visual feast, The Beach.
Stories are created to inspire us and teach us about our world and ourselves. Discover enlightenment in the everyday. Melville found his inspiration on a whaling boat. Clarke found hers through the twists and turns of an artists life. Where will you meet your muse?" />
