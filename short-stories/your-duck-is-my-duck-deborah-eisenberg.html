  <title>Your Duck Is My Duck - Deborah Eisenberg</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A much-anticipated collection of brilliantly observant short stories from one of the great American masters of the form.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At times raucously hilarious, at times charming and delightful, at times as solemn and mysterious as a pond at midnight, Deborah Eisenberg&amp;#8217;s stories gently compel us to confront the most disturbing truths about ourselves&amp;#8212;from our intimate lives as lovers, parents, and children, to our equally troubling roles as citizens on a violent, terrifying planet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each of the six stories in &lt;em&gt;Your Duck is My Duck&lt;/em&gt;, her first collection since 2006, has the heft and complexity of a novel. With her own inexorable but utterly unpredictable logic and her almost uncanny ability to conjure the strange states of mind and emotion that constitute our daily consciousness, Eisenberg pulls us as if by gossamer threads through her characters&amp;#8212;a tormented woman whose face determines her destiny; a group of film actors shocked to read a book about their past; a privileged young man who unexpectedly falls into a love affair with a human rights worker caught up in an all-consuming quest that he doesn&#39;t understand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Eisenberg&amp;#8217;s world, the forces of money, sex, and power cannot be escaped, and the force of history, whether confronted or denied, cannot be evaded. No one writes better about time, tragedy and grief, and the indifferent but beautiful universe around us.&lt;/p&gt;" />
