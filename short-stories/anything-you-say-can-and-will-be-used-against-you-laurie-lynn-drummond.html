  <title>Anything You Say Can and Will Be Used Against You - Laurie Lynn Drummond</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;This riveting debut collection of short fiction about women cops comes from the author&#39;s real&amp;ndash;life experience as a Baton Rouge police officer. In an entirely fresh and unique voice, these stories reveal the humanity, compassion, humour, tragedy and redemption hidden behind the &quot;blue wall.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Anything You Say Can and Will Be Used Against You centres on the lives of five female police officers. Each woman&#39;s story&amp;ndash;like each call in a police officer&#39;s day&amp;ndash;varies in its unique drama, but all the tales illuminate the tenuous line between life and death, violence and control, despair and salvation. Because the stories come from the author&#39;s own experience, they open a curtain on the truth behind the job&amp;ndash;how officers are trained to deal with the smell of death, how violence clings to a crime scene long after the crime is committed, how the police determine when to engage in or diffuse violence, why some people make it from the academy to the force and some don&#39;t, and all the friendships, romances, and dramas that happen along the way. It illuminates not only how officers feel while they are in uniform, holding their guns, but also what they feel after they go home and put those guns aside. &lt;/p&gt;" />
