  <title>The Ugly Woman of Castello di Putti - A. M. Dellamonica</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Returning to the world of Stormwrack where she set the tor.com story &quot;Among the Silvering Herd,&quot; A.M. Dellamonica offers a new story that takes us deeper into this fascinating world, the site of her new fantasy novel &lt;i&gt;Child of a Hidden Sea&lt;/i&gt;. The Fleet, integral to the governing of a world that is mostly water sprinkled with a number of islands, must deal with a unique form of magic, Inscribing, which is so subtle that its effects can sometimes only be known in retrospect. When a ship of the fleet visits an island where scripping is common, the crew members of the sailing vessel &lt;i&gt;Nightjar&lt;/i&gt; are at a disadvantage when faced with local matters of which they know little or nothing at all. Strangers on the shore, indeed, they may enjoy the local customs . . . but also may attract unwonted attention that could cost them more than embarrassment or money . . . &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Castello di Putti has a suggestive sound to it, but don&#39;t be deceived. This is a story of civil strife, of culture shock, and ultimately of the risks and rewards of naval duty. Filled with Dellamonica&#39;s fresh, inventive worldbuilding and the &lt;i&gt;joie de vivre&lt;/i&gt; of a society in flux, it shows a side of Stormwrack very different from what she presented in the previous tale.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the Publisher&#39;s request, this title is being sold without Digital Rights Management Software (DRM) applied.&lt;/p&gt;" />
