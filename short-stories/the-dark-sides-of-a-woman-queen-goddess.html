  <title>The Dark Sides of a Woman - Queen Goddess</title>
      <meta name="description" content="In this collection of inspirational short stories, author Queen Goddess explains valuable moral lessons in a realistic and modern setting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;White Ain&#39;t Always Right!&quot;-&lt;I&gt;Instead of Arlene asking for a good honest man whether he be a Black man, Latin man, Indian man or Asian man, Arlene asked for a white man. She got him. Boy did she get him.&lt;/I&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Chocolate Tropical Delights&quot;-&lt;I&gt;Ming&#39;s parents took their daughter&#39;s sexual preference very hard. Nevertheless, they had no other choice but to accept their daughter&#39;s gay lifestyle.&lt;/I&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Mama&#39;s Boy Toy&quot;-&lt;I&gt; when children are subjected to physical and sexual abuse many of them will become very reckless and violent. Unfortunately, many may end up in prison or experience mental instability. However, there is hope as in the case of Sammy Jr. When someone has experienced or suffered childhood abuse and finally finds the courage to face their darkness and seek counseling, healing is then possible.&lt;/I&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Stick Up Kidz&quot;-&lt;I&gt; life is short, so live each day like it&#39;s your last day, and do unto others, as you would have them do unto you. Tomorrow is promised to no one. It took a robbery for Donna to realize that.&lt;/I&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />
