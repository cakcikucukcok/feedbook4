  <title>This Love - Z A Bukhari</title>
      <meta name="description" content="At their school in Pakistan, no girl or boy of senior section is allowed to talk to each other. But Sara admires the boy, Omer, from afar. Though her thoughts should be focused on schooling, she cant help thinking about this boy. She wonders if love is a drug; she doesnt know love but she believes she is taking the drug. 
At the same time, Omer catches a glimpse of Sara. He, too, must excel at school to please his parents. He believes love can never be harmful but likens premature love to something like premature delivery. 
In This Love the author Z A Bukhari explores the social atmosphere of the contemporary love from several perspectives focusing on Sara and Omer both raised in traditionally Pakistani ways. Moreover, it tells of the importance of faith, fate and family roots and freshness of ones first love." />
