  <title>Vicious Circles - Ayman Farouk Taha</title>
      <meta name="description" content="We usually live our lives in vicious cycles. We hardly can get out of them or break loose from their control. Sometimes they are related to some place, time, person, or event. Other times they are related to an idea so deeply planted inside us that we can&#39;t come out of its cocoon. Maybe they are related to a connection that we cant be free from its restrictions. Finally, sometimes they are related to ourselves; body and soul. 
We invent those circles or they are imposed upon us. Then we live within their borders. We rejoice them first, and then we complain. Or, we complain from them first, and then we give up ourselves to them happily. We try to break loose a lot, although the constraint, unconsciously, makes up happy. Or, we often look for a constraint to protect us from what our souls were created and imprinted to love; the freedom. We struggle with ourselves, others, and life; although we mostly don&#39;t know what we really want. Moreover, we do not dare to look for what we want. This is why most of us live in  vicious circles." />
