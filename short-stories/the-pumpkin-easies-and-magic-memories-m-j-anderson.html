  <title>The Pumpkin-Easies and Magic Memories - M.J. Anderson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="A great pumpkin grew on our allotment. It was grown for our grandchildren to take to school at Halloween. It was unwanted and it ended up back in the compost bin. But many creatures living on the allotment did want it, especially the Easies.
This is a story of ancient creaturesthe Easieswho try to live away from people. They are talented and determined and they have evolved special powers. Nowadays they are very fast, small, and chameleon-like as they can change shape and colour. They can also communicate telepathically.
Loss of land and habitat means that they now are forced to live much closer to people. One tribes home has recently been destroyed, and they desperately needed to find shelter and food to tide them over the coming winter. They overcame many difficulties by capturing the Great Pumpkin.  This had cost them dearly and so to help their injured heroes they turned to magic memories  -  a dangerous form of magic." />
