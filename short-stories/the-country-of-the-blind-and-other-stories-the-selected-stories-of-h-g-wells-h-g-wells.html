  <title>The Country of the Blind and Other Stories (The Selected Stories of H. G. Wells) - H. G. Wells</title>
      <meta name="description" content="H. G. Wells (1866-1946) is widely considered the father of the science fiction genre. His stories examine space and time travel, alien worlds, and the destructive potential of modern technology. Wells&#39; influence is far reaching and remains potent today. &quot;The Country of the Blind and Other Stories&quot; collects thirty-three of Wells&#39; most renowned short stories. In &quot;The Country of the Blind,&quot; perhaps his most famed shorter work, Nunez the mountaineer falls does the side of a mountain on an expedition only to discover an isolated valley with a mysterious populace where everyone is blind. In &quot;The Crystal Egg,&quot; an antiques dealer discovers a mysterious crystal egg that allows him to remotely view the planet Mars. &quot;The Man Who Could Work Miracles&quot; follows an individual whose supernatural talents gradually become problematic and even disastrous. These are only a few of the many exciting tales contained in this edition by England&#39;s most respected science fiction author." />
