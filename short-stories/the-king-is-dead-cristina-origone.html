  <title>The King Is Dead - Cristina Origone</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The king is dead by Cristina Origone&lt;br/&gt;
Towards what does insicurity inherent in the human existence and the fear of judgement of others push?&lt;br/&gt;
Giovanni is fifty-eight years old, a simple man who lives in a small town from the Ligurian hinterland.When a morning he wakes up and doesn&#39;t find Alina, he&#39;s not worried; it&#39;s not the first time that, after a fight, she wakes up early to buy bread and warm buns to be forgiven. But, as soon as he finds out she disappeared with their savings, he&#39;s hit by vertigo: Alina has gone back to Russia and has left him? At first he hardly believes it but when he takes notice of the situation, he feels betrayed on his pride and tried to lie to everyone. But that lie will pull him into a vortex, where doubts start tormenting him: what has happened to Alina?&lt;br/&gt;
From this moment his life changes, the paranoia of being judged by the townsfolk will make him doubt everyone, even his most close friends, and will drive him to hear things that don&#39;t exist. Until the truth will be revealed.&lt;br/&gt;
Will Giovanni be able to accept it?&lt;br/&gt;
The king is dead is a drammatic story that narrates the tale of a man that feels like the absolute owner of his woman and the disappearance of his companion will surface his limits and sterness which, since always, block his relationships, forcing him to deal with himself.&lt;br/&gt;" />
