In each of these stories Alby distills the anguish, the terror, the humor, and the strange grace--or lack of--he experiences in the aftermath of his mother&#39;s death. Swirling at the center of Alby&#39;s rage is a grief so big, so profound, it might swallow him whole. As he drinks, screws, and jokes his way through his pain and heartache, Alby&#39;s anger, his kindness, and his capacity for good bubble up when he (and we) least expect it. Sumell delivers &quot;a naked rendering of a heart sorting through its broken pieces to survive.*&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Making Nice&lt;/i&gt; is a powerful, full-steam-ahead ride that will keep you laughing even as you try to catch your breath; a new classic about love, loss, and the fine line between grappling through grief and fighting for (and with) the only family you&#39;ve got.&lt;br&gt;*Mark Richard&lt;/p&gt;" />
