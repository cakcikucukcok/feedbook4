  <title>Rocking Chair Confessions - Delbert Pape</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Richard Montgomery is about to discover what happens when he enters a wrong number on his phone. As a resident of a one-horse town, Richard has nothing else to do but think about settling down and having children. Everything changes when he accidentally proposes to the wrong womanor so he thinks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While growing up in Missoula, Montana, Carolyn never imagines she could solve an actual criminal case just by watching television. But when the past comes back to haunt her, Eddie the bandit receives the surprise of his life. When she was just a girl, Marty immigrated from a small village outside Naples, Italy, to Austin, Texas, not realizing that one day, she would hold an incredible secret in silence. Brian has just encountered his final scene on earth, but as he floats above his body, he has no idea that he will return once again to teach his widow about life, love, and eternity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Rocking Chair Confessions&lt;/i&gt; presents a collection of short tales populated by eclectic characters who boldly face happy surprises, difficult decisions, and all the spontaneity and valuable lessons that life has to offer.&lt;/p&gt;" />
