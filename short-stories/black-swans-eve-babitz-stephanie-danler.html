  <title>Black Swans - Eve Babitz, Stephanie Danler</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;b&gt;The Eve Babitz phenomenon continues with this special reissue of her 1993 story collection in a beautiful new edition&lt;/b&gt;
A new reissue by the writer who has been acclaimed by the &lt;i&gt;Boston Globe&lt;/i&gt; as a &quot;true original&quot; and by the &lt;i&gt;San Francisco Chronicle&lt;/i&gt; as &quot;marvelously witty and wildly observant&quot; and of whom Joseph Heller has said, &quot;Her words are worth one hundred moving pictures.&quot;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; 
&lt;i&gt;Black Swans&lt;/i&gt; is a collection of nine stories that look back on the 1980s—a decade of dreams, drink, and stoned youth turning Republican. Babitz prowls California telling tales of a changing world. She writes about the Rodeo Gardens, about AIDS, about learning to tango, about the cemetery of Hollywood, the self-enchanted city, and, most importantly, about the envy and jealousy underneath it all.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
 Babitz&#39;s inimitable voice propels these stories forward, corralling everything that gets in their way: sex, rage, the Chateau Marmont, youth, beauty, Jim Morrison, men, women, and black swans.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
 This exciting reissue further celebrates the phenomenon of Eve Babitz, cementing her reputation as the voice of a generation.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;&quot;Eve Babitz is a little like Madame de Sevigne, that inveterate letter-writer of Louis XIV&#39;s time, transposed to the Chateau Marmont in the late 20th-Century—lunching, chatting, dressing, loving and crying in Hollywood, that latter-day Versailles.&quot; —&lt;i&gt;Los Angeles Times&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;" />
