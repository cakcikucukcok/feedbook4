      <meta name="description" content="From very early childhood, Mitsy longs for closeness with others&amp;ndash;a free-flowing acceptance, approval, rapport, and respect that ideally should exist in the &amp;quot;perfect family.&amp;quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Somehow, Mitsy realizes she does not have a &amp;quot;perfect family.&amp;quot; She lives a solitary, friendless, and lonely life. Peering out her bedroom window and seeing the hustle and bustle of activity in the town square only heighten her desire to be a part of it all.&lt;br&gt;Grandmother Fisher starts teaching a very young Mitsy about friendship and what makes a good friend. Mitsy learns that relationships are basic life skills that must be mastered and nurtured.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;From age two, Mitsy&amp;#39;s life consists of starting, developing, and ending relationships. Some, she is thrown into; others, she chooses. However they develop, relationships are an inescapable part of her life. Mitsy&amp;#39;s relationships bring her great joy, deep sorrow, persistent problems, and devastating disappointments.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This book is a collection of Mitsy&amp;#39;s stories based on her relationships&amp;ndash;grandparents, parents, her first friend, best buddies, colleagues, love interests, and her relationship within.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As you read, try to gain insights into your own relationships. Relish the ideas, memories, and feelings that arise. Connect with your emotions; express your feelings. Heal a wound Forgive a hurt. Share a thought or idea. Savor moments of joy, and revel in your own successes.&lt;br&gt;" />
