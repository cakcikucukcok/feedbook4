  <title>The Collected Stories of Richard Yates - Richard Yates, Richard Russo</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;A literary event of the highest order, &lt;i&gt;The Collected Stories of Richard Yates&lt;/i&gt; brings together Yates&#39;s peerless short fiction in a single volume for the first time.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Richard Yates was acclaimed as one of the most powerful, compassionate, and technically accomplished writers of America&#39;s postwar generation, and his work has inspired such diverse talents as Richard Ford, Ann Beattie, André Dubus, Robert Stone, and Kurt Vonnegut Jr. This collection, as powerful as Yate&#39;s beloved &lt;i&gt;Revolutionary Road&lt;/i&gt;, contains the stories of his classic works Eleven Kinds of Loneliness (a book &lt;i&gt;The New York Times Book Review&lt;/i&gt; hailed as &quot;the New York equivalent of Dubliners&quot;) and Liars in Love; it also features nine new stories, seven of which have never been published.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whether addressing the smothered desire of suburban housewives, the white-collar despair of Manhattan office workers, the grim humor that attends life on a tuberculosis ward, or the moments of terrified peace experienced by American soldiers in World War II, Yates examines every frayed corner of the American dream. His stories, as empathetic as they are unforgiving, are like no others in our nation&#39;s literature. Published with a moving introduction by the novelist Richard Russo, this collection will stand as its author&#39;s final masterpiece.&lt;/p&gt;" />
