      <meta name="description" content="Story: The Clash with Robin and Squirrel
The Clash with Robin and Squirrel is a story about the struggles and conflicts that animals experience in the nature. 
Robin and Squirrel agreed to be civil to each other by respecting each others areas. Robins basic instinct tells her not to trust Squirrel who kept a curious eye on her nest. Also, Robin encounters several close calls where her life was almost taken away by other predators in search of food. These experiences serve as valid reasons not to trust anyone. But against her own feelings of discomfort, Robin launches out and trusts Squirrel. These incidents take place in the surroundings of an old gentleman, Mr. Gilbert, who kept a watchful eye on his garden in his struggle to keeps the animals away from getting his seed.
In this story, Robin goes through a range of circumstances and emotions. Many of which are used to teach valuable life lessons to its readers. Would Squirrel live up to the expectation placed in him by Robin? How will the story end? Who get hurt? Who lives? Who dies? 
Read this emotional and stirring story about Robin and Squirrel and their conflict, trust, and survival as they coexisted in their community." />
