  <title>White Light - Mark O&#39;Flynn</title>
      <meta name="description" content="In &lt;i&gt;White Light&lt;/i&gt;, a single mother seeks refuge in a religious cult, a young girl hijacks road machinery while her family dresses for church, another family down on their luck finds a gold ingot and the stability of a marriage is threatened by the arrival of a well-travelled ex-lover. &lt;br /&gt;O&#39;Flynn takes us into his local neighbourhood where people, both the ordinary and the bizarre, wrestle with the challenges and puzzles that life throws at them. His characters delight us and his language never ceases to surprise. &lt;br /&gt;In this eclectic collection, O&#39;Flynn, an accomplished poet, turns his hand to linked short stories, micro-fictions and monologues. He displays ventriloquist-like skill, conjuring Shakespeare&#39;s Iago, an illiterate inmate called Banjo and a famous Australian poet who finds herself trapped in a toilet cubicle. Monopoly and ping-pong become extended metaphors for the games of everyday life. The result is a heady mix of wordplay, philosophical ruminations and astute social observation.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;&amp;quot;O&#39;Flynn&#39;s faultless ear for laconic Aussie parlance, his wry ability to turn a story in a moment from comedy to tragedy and back again, his exhilaratingly deft range...all this makes him one of a kind, in my opinion. A hugely enjoyable collection.&amp;quot;&lt;/i&gt; CATE KENNEDY" />
