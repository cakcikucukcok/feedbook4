  <title>From Coolidge to Kauai - J. Marc. Merrill</title>
      <meta name="description" content="FROM COOLIDGE TO KAUAI takes readers from laughter to tears and unexpected twists, as in this scene:
&lt;p&gt;
Suddenly Daddy started clearing the top shelf of the refrigerator, throwing everything onto the floor with a vengeance.&lt;br&gt;
&quot;Stop it!&quot; Momma shouted. &quot;Stop it right now!&quot;&lt;br&gt;
&quot;Shut up!&quot; Daddy roared. &quot;Get out of my sight!&quot;&lt;br&gt;
Standing at the fireplace, Momma reached up, took down Grandpa Burke&#39;s shotgun, broke it open and pushed in two shells. &quot;No, Momma!&quot; I yelled as I ripped open the bedroom door, nearly knocking Melinda to the floor. I heard Danny leaping off the bed behind me and crying out, frightened.&lt;br&gt;
Daddy turned when I yelled. Seeing Momma with the shotgun he slammed the refrigerator door shut and then started for the living room. As he rounded the partition I could see her bringing up the double barrels, preparing to fire. I bolted out of the bedroom, running for Daddy, planning on pushing him out of the way.&lt;br&gt;
The shotgun blast never touched him, but it knocked me off my feet, stinging my back and my head and hurling me into the partition. I bounced back, flopping on the floor, my vision quickly fading to total darkness.&lt;br&gt;
An instant later I found myself in a park filled with light. Off to my right was a group of people. I didn&#39;t recognize any of them. Then a familiar figure walked past them and came up to me.&lt;br&gt;
&quot;Hi, Grandpa. What are you doing here?&quot;&lt;br&gt;
Grandpa Burke smiled, gave me a hug and then said, &quot;I&#39;ve come to show you something.&quot;&lt;br&gt;
&quot;Am I dead, Grandpa?&quot;&lt;br&gt;
