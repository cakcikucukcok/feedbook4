  <title>Other Resort Cities - Tod Goldberg</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;&amp;#147;Tod Goldberg&#39;s stories are not like faceted jewels. They are like glinting barbed wire, actually, roped across the field where you are reading, racing, wondering what&#39;s next, and then pierced with longing, regret, or revelation. His new collection kept me reading like that &amp;#151; racing to find out what would happen next to these people only Tod Goldberg could create.&amp;#8221; &amp;#151;Susan Straight&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&amp;#147;Tod Goldberg is a gifted writer, a surveyor of the soul, and &lt;I&gt;Other Resort Cities&lt;/I&gt; is powerful fiction. He catches his characters at moments of great stress, then reveals their depths to us with compelling insight and great empathy. He sure as hell knows the details that convince. These are inventive and fresh stories that might have been merely clever in lesser hands, but Goldberg&amp;#8217;s talent and compassion extends dignity even to the most fucked-up and misbegotten lives.&amp;#8221; &amp;#151;Daniel Woodrell&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&amp;#147;This is an excellent, compulsively readable collection. Goldberg knows and loves the cities of which he writes, and he brings their unsung citizens to life in a brilliant and affecting way.&amp;#8221; &amp;#151;Mary Yukari Waters&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&amp;#147;Darkly funny and ferociously readable, &lt;B&gt;Other Resort Cities&lt;/B&gt; is a book you&#39;ll want to spend your entire holiday reading. Because of the subtle crime plots that give each story momentum, Goldberg&#39;s book doubles as an ideal choice for mystery-lovers.&amp;#8221;&amp;#151;&lt;I&gt;Tucson Weekly&lt;/I&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;In ten seductive new stories, the author of &lt;I&gt;Simplify&lt;/I&gt; and &lt;I&gt;Living Dead Girl&lt;/I&gt; encounters the ruthless, vulnerable people who inhabit resort cities, along with their misdemeanors and felonies. A mobster hides out in Las Vegas posing as a rabbi; a casino cocktail waitress adopts a Russian teen in an attempt to outrun her loneliness; a disturbed husband sets up a Starbucks in his living room; a retired sheriff looks for his first wife&#39;s remains in the Salton Sea. Vibrant, moving, and often profound, &lt;I&gt;Other Resort Cities&lt;/I&gt; is Goldberg at his best.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;B&gt;Tod Goldberg &lt;/B&gt;is the author of seven books, including the novels &lt;I&gt;Living Dead Girl &lt;/I&gt;(Soho Press), a finalist for the Los Angeles Times Book Prize,&lt;I&gt; Fake Liar Cheat &lt;/I&gt;(Pocket Books/MTV) and the popular Burn Notice series (Penguin). His short story collection &lt;I&gt;Simplify&lt;/I&gt; (OV Books) was a 2006 finalist for the SCIBA Award for Fiction and winner of the Other Voices Short Story Collection Prize. He directs the MFA Program in Creative Writing and Writing for the Performing Arts at the University of California, Riverside&#39;s Palm Desert campus.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/div&gt;" />
