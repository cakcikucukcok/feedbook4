  <title>Things to Make and Break - May-Lan Tan</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&amp;bull; Booksellers and readers have responded with great enthusiasm to our Emily Books imprint, embracing both the ethos and the individual titles, and Tan&#39;s work has all the hallmarks of what that audience has responded to in previous books: dark humor, a strong voice, and a decidedly transgressive feminist stance.
&amp;bull; Sceptre is publishing &lt;i&gt;Things to Make and Break&lt;/i&gt; in the UK, giving our edition a great potential publicity runway. The previous, micro-press edition already has fans as well, so we&#39;re well situated to build review momentum. 
&amp;bull; Tan&#39;s stories are beautifully crafted, but they also have a bitter heart—each digs into the uncomfortable wounded spots that keep us from being fully present, fully alive, fully happy. 
&amp;bull; Short fiction, especially explicitly feminist short fiction, is enjoying something of a renaissance, and Tan&#39;s stories fit into a sweet spot between Machado&#39;s fabulism and Joy Williams&#39;s acidity." />
