  <title>Turbo&#39;s Very Life and Other Stories - Carroll Dale Short</title>
      <meta name="description" content="In the eighteen stories in this retrospective of his best short fiction, Dale Short shows why he is one of the best prose stylists of his generation and why he deserves a break-out success. Short&#39;s writing has been hailed by Wally Lamb as &quot;simultaneously mythical and modern; a wild ride,&quot; and Dennis Covington has called him &quot;wise and compassionate, a major Southern writer.&quot; He writes here from many perspectives-male, female, first person, third person, grieving widow, newly divorced dad, jailed redneck, river man laid up with heart trouble, conjure woman-and in every story the voice is as true as that of a child and as clear as fresh ice. The marvel of Short&#39;s prose is that the writing is so good it disappears, leaving the reader surrounded only by the story, which resonates long after the last word is absorbed. The other remarkable thing is how Short can go from comedy to tragedy within a single paragraph, sometimes within a single sentence, and then back again. His time lines here range from the Civil War to the near future, and the locales vary from a Kentucky mining town to the Gulf Coast of Mexico to the constellation Orion-all in all, a rare feast for the imagination. Stories that have appeared before only in magazines, this collection charts more than two decades of the growth and exploration of an author who won the first Redbook Fiction Prize at the age of twenty-seven, and whose acclaimed novel The Shining Shining Path was called by reviewers &quot;Southern magical realism&quot; and praised by Publishers Weekly as &quot;boldly imaginative; a provocative spiritual odyssey.&quot; Publisher&#39;s Weekly added, &quot;Short takes risks in a single paragraph that many writers never attempt in an entire novel.&quot;" />
