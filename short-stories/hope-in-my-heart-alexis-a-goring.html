  <title>Hope in My Heart - Alexis A. Goring</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Hope in My Heart is a collection of short, heartwarming stories with characters in need of hope.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;In Love Unexpected,a car crash brings commitment-wary Sebastian and career woman Chandra together. Neither is looking for romance, but those around them see the potential, and Sebastian and Chandra discover that sometimes love shows up unexpectedly.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Christmastime is the setting for the middle story, The Best Gift. Christina desires to lose ten pounds so she can fit into her dress for her sister&#39;s wedding. Jordan wishes her mom would stop trying to marry her off. And Joshua hopes to be reunited with his ex-girlfriend but eventually learns that the best gift this Christmas will be the restoration of his relationship with God.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;In Peace and Love, three characters living in a metropolitan area are desperately searching. Elle, a starving artist, aspires to become a paid professional. Eric, a divorce attorney, wants to resolve his issues concerning his parents&#39; divorce. Kristine anticipates finding her birth mom before she marries Derek. All characters pray their searches will conclude this holiday season and fill their hearts with peace and love.&lt;/p&gt;" />
