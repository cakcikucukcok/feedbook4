  <title>Run and Tell That - Karen Brisco</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Run and Tell That is a book of short stories that is breathtaking and heart pounding. You wont be able to put it down. Some stories may cause you to get angry, or even cause you to have hope again; hold on to your seats. Stay stillinhale, exhale. One thing is for sure; many people will be able to relate to one of these stories, be it good or bad.
The main thing is, dont take offense; think about it, and twirl it around in your head. Think about the secrets that someone you know has shared with you, the stories you heard from friends and family, and things that have happened to some of them. Believe it or not, one of these stories just may be yours, and if it is, dont worry, I got you! I will tell it just like it is! Maybe this may cause the abuser to stop the abuse, or the liars to stop lying. 
There are men and women out there that have so much dirt in their backyards that you cant see the grass. To the mothers and fathers, pay close attention to your kids. To husbands and wives, stop lying to each other; it is what is. Communicate, and dont be afraid of what he or she may say. Knowing is a beginning of moving forward toward dealing with whatever situations you face. Grow up people; you have the right to choose how you want to live your life. Its all about choices! Lets learn how to stop spinning our wheels, and know life goes on; you win some and lose some. Life has never been fair, and dont go around thinking that is it. Just be true to yourself and your good. In this world, we have freedom of speech, freedom of choice, and the right to be happy." />
