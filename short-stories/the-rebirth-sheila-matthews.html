I would like to welcome you to planet Zappelli. This planet has a few similarities to planet Earth. The trees here look the same, so do the animals, except everything here is ran differently. The people of this planet are called Teleiotians, which means perfection. Everything functions completely opposite to earth. Every citizen is born into a rich family. The people of this planet are happy beings. Happiness is a way of life there. The word sadness is not known to them. There is no jealousy. Everyone works together and has a common goalthat is to live happy and free and make the best of the life that is given to them. The Zapellians refer to each other as kings and queens. They are supernatural beings. They live for eternity. There are strict rules to this planet. That is why things run so smoothly. The rules apply to everyone of every race. Everyone there has a job and works for four hours a day and four days a week. Jobs are assigned according to their individual skills and born talent.
Although no one has the right to tell you what to do or where to work, the work you do is totally up to you.  We use our God-given talent here to help our community and our world. We call this process talent sharing. We all function as one. Although we have different personality traits, we function as one. We have a common purpose, a common goal. We all operate within that purpose, and that is to live happy and free and perfect within our world." />
