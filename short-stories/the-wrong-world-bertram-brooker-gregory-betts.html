  <title>The Wrong World - Bertram Brooker, Gregory Betts</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bertram Brooker won the country&#39;s first Governor General&#39;s Award for literature in 1936 for his novel &lt;i&gt;Think of the Earth&lt;/i&gt;, and his explosive, experimental paintings hang in every major gallery in the country. He was Canada&#39;s first multidisciplinary avantgardist, successfully experimenting in literature, visual arts, film, and theatre. Brooker brought all of his experimental ambitions to his short fiction and prose. &lt;i&gt;The Wrong World&lt;/i&gt; presents a rich sampling of his prose work, much of it previously unpublished, which adds new insight into his aesthetic ambitions. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Working during an incredible period of transition in Canadian society, Brooker&#39;s stories document Canada&#39;s evolution from a provincial colony into a modern, urban country. His essays participated in that evolution by advocating a passionate awakening of the arts, the end of prudish sentiment and censorship, and a radical rethinking of the nature of war. They capture the limitations and hypocrisies of the Canadian social contract and argue for a more just and spiritual society. His stories humanize his social vision by dramatizing the psychological and emotional cost of Canada&#39;s transition into a modern civilization. In turn devastating, penetrating and poignant, Brooker&#39;s prose works offer a sharply focussed window into the turbulent interwar years in Canada.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;" />
