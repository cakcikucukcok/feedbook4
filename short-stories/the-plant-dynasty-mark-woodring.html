  <title>The Plant Dynasty - Mark Woodring</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The events disclosed within these pages are designed to entertain as well as to awaken your imagination. Much of what is between these covers is true, but not all of it. The truth is very often stranger than fiction. Some may provide the basis for research by scientists more capable than I, and in doing so, change from being fiction to being reality. That which is impossible today, may be commonplace tomorrow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In many places, certain descriptive details are omitted to allow the reader to fill in the scenery with their own images. If they fail to materialize, maybe you&#39;re watching too much TV. Imagination blossoms with exercise. I hope at least one of the storylines will arouse yours.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Happy reading-&lt;/p&gt;
