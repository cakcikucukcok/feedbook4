  <title>Keep on Paddling - Roy Cerny</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The events in these true tales of the canoe country of northern Minnesota and Ontario were compiled over the authors lifetime of experience in the woods. Working with Boy Scouts and, in his later years, with employees, friends, family, and folks from his church, the author has led perhaps over five hundred people on trips into the Boundary Waters. The experiences on these trips over the past fifty years have provided a wealth of material that the author has crafted into enjoyable stories.
Some of the stories are educational, many are hilarious, more than a few are inspirational, all of them are entertaining. Each story stands alone, but the book is best read from the beginning. Words followed by asterisks are defined in a glossary for readers unfamiliar with canoeing or the Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness. After reading this book, the author hopes you will be better informed about the lake country, you will have a greater appreciation for the wilderness, and you might even be encouraged to take a canoe trip to see Gods country for yourself. If this happens, then the author has succeeded in his purpose." />
