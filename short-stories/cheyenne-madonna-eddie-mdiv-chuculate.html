  <title>Cheyenne Madonna - Eddie Mdiv Chuculate</title>
      <meta name="description" content="One stormy night in 1826, just north of Galveston Bay, Old Bull, a Cheyenne Indian who had just seen the ocean for the first time, found himself trying to outrace a hurricane. Lifted from his horse, spun around, and thrown down in the bayou, Old Bull rode the current into a small canyon, and survived. He was the only one of his party to return from the expedition, arriving home nearly naked, nearly hallucinating, riding a horse.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Such is the auspicious beginning to the life of Jordan Coolwater, a distant relation to Old Bull, whom we meet as a boy in the 1970s, shooting turtles on a summer day, and being raised by his grandparents on Creek Indian land in the house of his great-great-grandfather, a survivor of the &amp;quot;Trail of Tears.&amp;quot; Bearing the burden of his ancestry, Jordan Coolwater&amp;mdash;from bored young boy, to thoughtful teenager, struggling artist, escaped convict, and finally, father&amp;mdash;is the subject of Eddie Chuculate&amp;#39;s prize-winning collection of linked short stories. The first story in the collection, &amp;quot;Galveston Bay, 1826,&amp;quot; won an O&amp;#39;Henry Prize in 2007, and the second, &amp;quot;Yo Yo,&amp;quot; received a Pushcart Prize Special Mention.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Reminiscent of Denis Johnson&amp;#39;s Jesus&amp;#39;s Son, Chuculate&amp;#39;s gritty, deceptively simple stories also recall Junot Dias and Sherman Alexie. This is not only a portrait of a young Native American artist struggling with the two constants in his life, alcohol and art, but also a portrait of America, of its dispossessed, its outlaws, and its visionaries." />
