  <title>The Magic Book - Leonardo Deangelo</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Leonardo Deangelo has worn many hats in his lifetime, originally from Italy he moved to Australia when he was six. There he was enriched with various experiences from being a soldier, a movie director, a businessman, also as an artist, a sculptor, a designer, an art expert, now an author.
His previous Sam &amp; Spot The Lost Valley has been admired by Blueink Book Review as a fast-paced adventure novel for young boys , it has also been noted by Kirkus Book Review for the authors greatest strength in the delightful depiction of the friendship between Sam &amp; tail-wagging Spot, and has been described by ForeWord Book Reviews as an enticing boys adventure book that begs to be read aloud by grandfathers before bedtime!
His books have been advertised to various reputable literary outlets like The Guardian, London Review of Books, New York Review of Books, New York Times Sunday Book Review and the Readers Digest. 
Truly, he has proven that for whatever Hat you might be wearing, as long as you put your passionate heart and soul in it, it will naturally bring about happiness.
Witness another nail-biting rollercoaster experience, as Sam and his ever loyal dog Spot, embarks another chapter of adventure, love, friendship and thrill, as they discover a Magic Book.
In a different time &amp; space, set in a mystical land of Notts, where danger flourishes and evil creeps; Sam and Spots friendship will be put to a test.
Will greed and cruelty reign, or will bravery and honor prevail?
Find out how the Magic Book, will make the impossible, possible right before your eyes!" />
