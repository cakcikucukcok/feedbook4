  <title>Musings, Mutterings, and Aw Shucks - Elizabeth Carroll Foster</title>
      <meta name="description" content="On a hotter than Hades evening in southwest Arkansas, a preacher arrives at a crossroad village to convince those gathered that if they follow the word of God, they will not have to experience the real heat of Hades. In a heap of sweaty flesh, Miss Elsie Waylock plops in the middle of a center-row bench, unaware that the bench is dangerously sagging and threatening to crack at any moment. It is what happens next that sends Jimmy Hickok into a fiery hell created by none other than his mother.&lt;/p&gt;
In &lt;i&gt;Musings, Mutterings, and Aw Shucks&lt;/i&gt;, author Elizabeth Carroll Foster shares an entertaining collection of short stories, essays, and features that highlight eclectic characters, embellish true experiences, and eloquently illustrate unconditional love, disappointment, and friendship. Divided into sections that comprise short stories followed by essays, Foster shares a poignant, occasionally witty compilation that allows others to reminisce about holidays gone by, sympathize with middle-aged women unwittingly caught up on the cusp of the Womens Liberation Movement, empathize with young single mothers, and love a golden retriever just as he loves his master.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Musings, Mutterings, and Aw Shucks&lt;/i&gt; provides an unforgettable glimpse into both imaginary and real-life worlds that share a timeless and fresh perspective on life, love, and the pursuit of happiness." />
