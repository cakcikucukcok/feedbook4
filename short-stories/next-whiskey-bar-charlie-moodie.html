  <title>Next Whiskey Bar - Charlie Moodie</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;A collection of short stories and plays links characters on the edge of self-destruction with their favorite watering holes highlighting their stream of whiskey consciousness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sidle up to a bar stool and stake a claim. In &lt;i&gt;Next Whiskey Bar: Stories, Plays, and Drunk Talk&lt;/i&gt;, Charlie Moodie shares an eclectic collection of entertaining tales that bring to life the kinds of lonely characters who teeter on the periphery of self-destruction, lurk in dark watering holes, and tell timeless stories to anyone who will listen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moodie begins with three tales about people who are on a perpetual quest to find themselves. Declan is a young man who attempts to drown his troubles in a glass of whiskey; Katrina is a maid who lives in Parisif only on Sunday afternoons; and Cara has a big heart, but only she knows if she can achieve her dreams. With a common theme of music, Moodie weaves a tapestry of stories that illustrate his characters challenges as they struggle to understand each other in an uncertain world where love, loss, acceptance, and grief swirl within streams of whiskey consciousness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the Great Depression to the driving buzz of the todays cities, &lt;i&gt;Next Whiskey Bar&lt;/i&gt; takes you to the back of a bar, where listening to the music and eavesdropping on the sweet drunk talk make it all worthwhile.&lt;/p&gt;
