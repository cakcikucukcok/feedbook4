When Heathers bloody head rolled across the table, Alan was ecstatic. Great side effects, John. [A Prized Footage]
We screamed as we saw huge pale hands, fifty feet in diameter, holding the outer rails of the machine. [Roller Coaster Ride]
Mary floated above the witness stand, blood dripping from her body. [A Ghostly Presence] 
I was frozen by the sight of my torso, which now had the appearance of the body of a large snake.
