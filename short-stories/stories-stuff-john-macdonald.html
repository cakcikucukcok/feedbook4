  <title>Stories &amp; Stuff - John MacDonald</title>
      <meta name="description" content="We exist in an ever-changing world. One in which tomorrow is not a given thing. Our choices are prolific. I look around and see the excavation of history and the expanding field of space exploration but at the same time a diminishing protective shield that surrounds our planet due to an increase in temperature from chemical diffusion in the atmosphere. The pollution of our natural water sources combined with the overwhelming harvest of the seas can only mean less food and poorer water for us all. Added to this would be mans culpability for self-destruction, anywhere from theft, murder, racial differences, religious tensions, territorial debates, terrorist debacles, alcohol and drug abuse, and the list goes on and on.
What we seem to be missing is the main ingredient, the one most spectacular gift we have been given, and that is life itself. As our planet revolves, another dawn approaches, which offers another chance to see a glorious sunrise or perhaps to feel a drop of rain or hear a bolt of thunder as lightening splits the air we breathe. The living force of mother nature shakes hands with humanity, and all is well for the moment, and that is all we have. I choose to live while I can. I want to see another sunrise and take a midnight stroll under the moon. I want to make another friend, to shake his hand, to muddle through the sea of modern politics. But most of all, I want the opportunity to cast my vote for life. How about you?" />
