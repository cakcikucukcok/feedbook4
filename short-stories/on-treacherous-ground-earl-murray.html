  <title>On Treacherous Ground - Earl Murray</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The American West has long inspired intrigue and violence-everything from gunfights at the OK Corral to modern-day murders, scandals, and botched investigations that dominate the nation&#39;s headlines. With many of them based on actual events, this collection of short stories takes on the West in all of its treacherous guises: from the Old West, where Joaquim Murietta, the real-life inspiration for Zorro, battles California Rangers who are out for his head, to modern-day Montana, where one man&#39;s wealth takes him into the dark corners of the illegal artifacts trade and where another sees murder as a viable way to take over his neighbor&#39;s life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bizarre, fascinating, and eminently imaginative, this veteran writer of America&#39;s last wild and secluded places shows us the West in all of its grim splendor, with just enough disguise to protect the guilty.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;With his usual adroit storytelling, Murray communicates his love for the West while championing the victims of its early expansion and condemning the villains of today. &quot; - &lt;i&gt;Publishers Weekly&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the Publisher&#39;s request, this title is being sold without Digital Rights Management Software (DRM) applied.&lt;/p&gt;" />
