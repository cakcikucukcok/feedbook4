  <title>Bad Haircut - Tom Perrotta</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author Tom Perrotta&#39;s first book is &quot;more powerful than any coming-of-age novel&quot; --&lt;i&gt;The Washington Post&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Bad Haircut&lt;/i&gt; explores the themes that have fascinated Perrotta throughout his career: suburban rituals and mores; sports and religion; the cheerful cheesiness of American consumer life; public tests of manliness; and the moral dilemmas faced by ordinary people, parents, and teenagers alike.  Perrotta has continued to explore these subjects in novels from &lt;i&gt;Election&lt;/i&gt; to &lt;i&gt;The Abstinence Teacher&lt;/i&gt;.    &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ten rich stories here are linked by a single protagonist: Buddy, an adolescent suburban New Jersey boy who is truly seeing his world for the first time and already finding it both mysterious and lacking.  Whether he&#39;s out on a Boy Scout trip with his mother and discovering that his mother actually knows--and has a history with--the man inside the battered foam hot dog costume in &quot;The Weiner Man&quot;, feeling the first glimmer that sex might actually be possible for him in &quot;Thirteen&quot;, or finding himself swept along on a prank gone very wrong in &quot;Snowman,&quot; Buddy is both a recognizable American boy and a trademark Perrotta hero.  &lt;i&gt;Bad Haircut&lt;/i&gt; is a moving, spare book from a writer who, even this early in his career, had an assured sense of the complexity of his characters&#39; emotional landscapes.&lt;/p&gt;" />
