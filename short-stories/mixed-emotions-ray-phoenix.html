  <title>Mixed Emotions - Ray Phoenix</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Mixed Emotions is a book of short stories which have been written over a number of years. It is mainly for two charities that have a special place in Rays heart due to their excellent care and tireless dedication. Remember Us is a charity which provides a unique social outlet to people with special needs and their families in the North Fingal region. The Jack &amp; Jill Foundation is a charity which provides direct funding, to families of children with brain damage up to the age of 4 who suffer severe intellectual and physical developmental delay, enabling them to purchase home respite care.
