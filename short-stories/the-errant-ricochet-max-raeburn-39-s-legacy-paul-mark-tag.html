  <title>The Errant Ricochet: Max Raeburn&#39;s Legacy - Paul Mark Tag</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Before Paul Mark Tag discovered his niche writing thrillers, he honed his storytelling craft by penning short stories. This medley includes fourteen of Paul&#39;s favorites, written over a period of five years.&lt;P&gt;
Expect to experience a range of emotions as you page through this engaging and eclectic collection. You&#39;ll feel the trepidation of two boys delivering Christmas cookies to their scary neighbor in &quot;The Curious Miss Crabtree.&quot; You&#39;ll wonder if six-year-old Mary&#39;s girlfriends-who visit at night!-are real or imaginary in &quot;Mary&#39;s Secret.&quot; You&#39;ll recognize the conflict of feeling different in &quot;A Matter of Honor,&quot; as an immigrant accepts his heritage. In &quot;Double Exposure,&quot; you&#39;ll indulge in the curiosity and resolve of a spunky teenager who&#39;s been told she&#39;s always been too smart for her own good. Her instinct to investigate draws her into a neighborhood mystery. And &quot;The Long Walk Home,&quot; at only 128 words long, will touch your deepest emotions.&lt;P&gt;
These stories, many previously published, will warm your heart, keep you on the edge of your seat, and make you cry. The book&#39;s crowning jewel, &quot;The Errant Ricochet: Max Raeburn&#39;s Legacy,&quot; will induce you to do all three." />
