  <title>Consolidated Separates - E.B. Burbridge</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Accept the invitation to become intangled in the situations of the characters of several genres.
Have you ever been confronted by a managerial barracuda? 
Have you thought about future teens who need an inner racial upgrade to get an education? 
Now that you are a hundred years old; old people like you have to pay more property taxes or you might be homeless. What do you do? 
Everybody has dozed at the wheel, but when you awake you have unwanted company. 
You have been visited by a former associate of questionable character whose presence could threaten your future. What is the plan to stop him? 
The lack of an educated younger generation and the incentive to achieve a higher standard of living, the result could be: the elderly fall prey after dark to the young. 
Just think, after a life of entanglements, you awaken to a surgeon standing over you." />
