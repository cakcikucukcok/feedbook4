  <title>If the Sky Falls: Stories - Nicholas Montemarano</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;If the Sky Falls is the debut short-story collection from award-winning fiction writer Nicholas Montemarano. These eleven stories show why Jayne Anne Phillips has called Montemarano &quot;an American stylist capable of redeeming our darkest dreams.&quot;&lt;br&gt;Redemption in these intense and sometimes violent stories is found in the lyrical prose, in the act of storytelling itself. A young man tries to rescue his sister from her abusive lover, and in the process must revisit his own family&#39;s violent history (&quot;Note to Future Self&quot;); a home healthcare worker pops pills and takes two men with cerebral palsy to a strip club (&quot;The Usual Human Disabilities&quot;); a man has a breakdown years after witnessing a brutal murder and doing nothing to help the victim (&quot;The Other Man&quot;). In &quot;The November Fifteen,&quot; a man is taken from his home and tortured, though he has no idea why; when he returns home he finds a different kind of torture awaiting him.&lt;br&gt;Two of the stories -- &quot;Shift&quot; and the Pushcart Prize--winning &quot;The Worst Degree of Unforgivable&quot; -- are stylistic tours de force. But style in this collection is always at the service of story. Montemarano&#39;s fiction maintains that rare balance between traditional storytelling and experimentation: his work is innovative without being flashy, sincere without being sentimental. In an age of hype, If the Sky Falls truly is the real thing -- an original and important achievement in the short-story form.&lt;/p&gt;" />
