  <title>Family Happiness and Other Stories - Leo Tolstoy</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&quot;Family Happiness and Other Stories&quot; collects six stories by Russian born Leo Tolstoy (1828-1910). Most known for &quot;War and Peace&quot; and &quot;Anna Karenina,&quot; considered two of the greatest novels in world literature, Tolstoy also penned numerous novellas and short stories which remain valuable classics in their own regards. First published as a novella in 1859, &quot;Family Happiness&quot; explores the female identity within changing romantic relationships. Narrated in first person by the female protagonist Masha, the tale is a skilled and engrossing story of woman&#39;s difficult position in a shifting society. &quot;Three Deaths&quot; follows three characters who each are stricken with fatal cases of consumption. Tolstoy examines death with an eloquence and realism unseen in his contemporaries. In &quot;The Three Hermits&quot; an archbishop on a sea voyage pursues three wise men on a secluded island. In &quot;The Devil,&quot; two brothers struggle with a new inheritance riddled with debts when sudden romance and lust threaten to turn their world upside down. &quot;Father Sergius&quot; tells of a young aristocrat who, upon discovery of his fiancé&#39;s infidelity, retreats into the life of a monastic Orthodox Christian, though this radically new life proves to be difficult. Lastly, in &quot;Master and Man,&quot; a landowner and his peasant journey to purchase a small forest only to get caught in a blizzard. The ethics of self-sacrifice resolve this moralizing tale. These classic short stories from Russia&#39;s greatest author demonstrate his supreme skill and timeless talent." />
