  <title>Season of the Coyote Secret - Kenn Sherwood Roe</title>
      <meta name="description" content="W  hen a family of coyotes  the species, eliminated from the area by extensive trapping and poisoning  settles on my Grandfathers ranch, the neighbors become alarmed for fear that their poultry and livestock will be killed. After two powerful ranchers (Mr. Henderson and Mr. Diego), demand that he take action to destroy the animals, Grandfather refuses unless necessary, believing that most predators are condemned by the deeds of a few. I and my friend, Amy Lou Henderson, a talented wildlife artist, who was crippled in a car accident, become involved, not only against the neighbors intent on annihilation, but, involved in secretly observing the familys fascinating growth and interplay from an old shed suggested by Grandfather. Ultimately, it is I, supported by Amy Lou (Granddaughter of Mr. Henderson), who must confront the armed intruders on our ranch, who have illegally placed poison and traps on our land, when Grandfather is forced to halt because of a chest pain." />
