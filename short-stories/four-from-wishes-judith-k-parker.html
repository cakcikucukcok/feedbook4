  <title>Four from Wishes - Judith K. Parker</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;	Here are stories to challenge the readers mind and heart. Youve survived the wilderness, but can you survive civilization? Is there someone for everyone? Will you grab your dream or destroy it? Who will you sacrifice to fulfill your ambitions?&lt;P&gt;	Four from Wishes is a collection of three short stories and a novella. In each, a woman reaches a point of decision. What she decides will determine, not only her own happiness, but also the happiness or even survival of another.&lt;P&gt;	In The Edge of the World, set in the nineteenth century, a young woman tells how she and a small group of women and children survived alone on an island in the South Pacific. What she leaves out of her tale becomes more compelling than what she includes.&lt;P&gt;	Tired of waiting for the perfect love, a woman of the very near future takes matters into her own hands. With Satisfaction Guaranteed, the outcome will depend on a stranger knowing her even better than she knows herself.&lt;P&gt;	The Dreamer and the Dream begins with a routine police call. However, in futuristic New York City, routine calls can end with elevators full of snakes or stairwells full of dinosaurs. Officer Washington finds herself sorting out dreams from nightmares.&lt;P&gt;	Battle, the collections novella, is the story of Caroline and Elizabeth. Caroline is a technician in a facility funded by a government eager to improve its citizens. Elizabeth is a prisoner, an unwilling participant in the facilitys genetic experiments. Knowledge, ambition, honor, and humanity become weapons as the women battle for their lives and futures.&lt;/P&gt;" />
