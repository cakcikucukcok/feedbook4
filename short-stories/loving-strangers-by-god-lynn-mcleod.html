  <title>Loving Strangers by God - Lynn McLeod</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Deep inside each of us a miraculous yearning to be known is sewn into the places God knows best. From the first movements within the womb to the last breath we take, &quot;know me&quot; is whispered throughout our lives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Author Lynn McLeod&#39;s,&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Loving Strangers by God&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, collides the two adages we were raised with - &quot;stop to smell the flowers&quot; and &quot;don&#39;t talk to strangers.&quot; Happening amid the impact is where she reveals some of God&#39;s most mysterious artwork. What if strangers were actually disguised flowers? What if secrets within us could only be unlocked through their eyes? And what if the beauty in God&#39;s creation is especially miraculous when found there? Most of us can point to an unlikely encounter with a stranger that held a powerful new appreciation for how we could be known.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Told through short stories, each chapter skillfully studies how God&#39;s mighty, powerful, and unfathomable hand touches us with the strangers who cross our path. Among those you will meet are a young girl accepting bubblegum from a stranger who teaches her the protection found in truth, a man in an elevator who redirects the path of a troubled woman as he prays, a millionaire who refuses to allow changes in life change her, a blind author who encourages a clear vision, and a nurse who comforts a critically injured patient by finding her missing dog.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Loving Strangers by God&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;you will begin to recognize not only how strangers impact your own life, but also how as a stranger you impact the lives of others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;  
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&quot;I remain confident of this: I will see the goodness of the Lord in the land of the living.&quot;  Psalm 27:13&lt;br&gt;
Now promise me with the loving guidance of our Heavenly Father you will take the very best care . . . then share it!&lt;br&gt;
Blessings of light, joy and peace!!!&lt;/center&gt;" />
