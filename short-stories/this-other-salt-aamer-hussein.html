  <title>This Other Salt - Aamer Hussein</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Betrayal, bereavement, exile, belonging - these are the themes that resonate throughout This Other Salt. A writer, torn between two loves, looks for his lost words in the gaps between memory, mourning and desire in the title story; in &#39;The Lost Cantos of the Silken Tiger&#39; a poet revenges herself on her faithless lover by turning their romance into a legend of biblical proportions; and a teenage boy&#39;s life uncannily begins to resemble the role he plays in a school operetta in &#39;The Blue Direction&#39;. Combining satire, legend, poetry, history and memoir, the linked stories of This Other Salt reveal an author of uncommon talent at the height of his craft. &#39;Extraordinarily controlled, written in a tactile, musical prose, with a very individual sense of beauty.&#39; Amit Chaudhuri &#39;Each story, remarkable in both expansiveness and precision, sings with heartbreak, intelligence and elegy. A stunning collection.&#39; Kamila Shamsie &#39;Poetic perfection … Drawing on legend, history, memoir, literature and film, Hussein&#39;s stories are meant to be cupped in both hands and savoured slowly, like a cup of cardamom chai.&#39; Guardian &#39;These stories are a treat for readers.&#39; Newsline" />
