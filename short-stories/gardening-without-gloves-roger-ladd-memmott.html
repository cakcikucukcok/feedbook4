  <title>Gardening Without Gloves - Roger Ladd Memmott</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;&lt;b&gt;GARDENING WITHOUT GLOVES&lt;/b&gt;&lt;P&gt;Short Fiction - Literary/Mainstream&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;What comes of &lt;b&gt;Gardening Without Gloves&lt;/b&gt;? Read each of the twelve stories in this volume to find answers that you wouldnt expect. On one level Memmotts book is an excursion into the psychology of love, while on another level it voices the despair of love and relationships misunderstood. One story shows this weathered visage and another one that. The characters, in their own dangerous and diametrical ways, are overcome by the elusive, and sometimes disillusioning, expectations of love. Flawed by misapprehension, they are often left bereaved, puzzling only the ambiguities of love, or what they thought was love, and how it slipped away.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;There is energy here, the kind of sensual energy that is lacking from most fiction todaya fascinating piece of writing.&lt;br&gt;Raymond Federman, author of &lt;i&gt;Take It or Leave It&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;b&gt;~ STORY SYNOPSES ~&lt;b/&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;b&gt;AN OPTIONAL ILLUSION&lt;/b&gt; - In retrospect a young man witnesses the landscape of his youth and one particular event of infatuation and violence that stays with him like a tremor.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;b&gt;GARDENING WITHOUT GLOVES&lt;/b&gt; - If marriage, to be successful, is simply a matter of forgiveness, then the commitment to love should be greater and is more important than love itself. A sad realization for two divorcees who long for intimacy and a renewal of trust but fear the possibility of dread.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;b&gt;PITTONS&lt;/b&gt; - An abused woman on the verge of a nervous breakdown grows suspicious of her childs imaginary friend and dreads the very real possibility that he has vanished into another world.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;b&gt;SOLANUM TUBEROSUM&lt;/b&gt; - A middle-aged man picks up a young woman hitchhiker and confronts within himself something beyond fear.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;b&gt;GREETINGS FROM ZANESVILLE&lt;/b&gt; (or Through the Anonymous Skin of Unclaimed Bones) - A man returns home with his wife after a Rock Concert and, sexually snubbed, takes a solitary walk in the park.
