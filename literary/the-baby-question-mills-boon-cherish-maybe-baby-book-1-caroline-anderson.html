  <title>The Baby Question (Mills &amp; Boon Cherish) (Maybe Baby, Book 1) - Caroline Anderson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;em&gt;Ready for a baby . . .&lt;/em&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;When Laurie married the love of her life, Rob, she knew her dreams had come true! But there’s just one more dream left to fulfil… becoming a mother. After several years of waiting, Laurie realises that her marriage is perhaps not-so-perfect after all – Rob is working so hard, she wonders if he’s even ready for a baby. Desperate for some time to think, she travels to Scotland alone. Yet, within a day Rob is by her side, begging her for an explanation. It’s now or never – and so, Laurie is forced to pose ‘the baby question’… and put their love for one other to the test!&lt;/p&gt;
