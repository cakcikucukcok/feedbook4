  <title>The Purple Sky - Peter Anthony Swiderski</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;PETER BARBIERIS mesmerizing Book One of his trilogy depicts the resentment,
suspicion, and intrigue that direct the lives of one Native American family
living in North America prior to the European invasion. Book One begins with
the birth of a son and ends with two brothers fi ght-to-the-death.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;i&gt;The Purple Sky&lt;/I&gt; is an account of EMILY MADDINGs (b. 1765, d. 1857) dreamvisits
to a small Native American village. In a manner most mysterious and uncanny,
Emily lives the life of PALE-MOON, one of the villages women. Emily
defi nes her relationship with Pale-Moon in this way:&lt;p&gt;
It is as if I am here now, on the tenth of January, 1806, sitting at my desk, living
a life as wife and mother  a life with a memory, history, and a fancied future 
and yet I am vaguely aware of a ubiquitous presence hovering in an indefi nable
space; a presence that connects me to all that has been and to all that will be.
In so far as the Native American woman is concerned, Emily is her ubiquitous
presence, and she [Pale-Moon] is to a certain extent aware of it.&lt;p&gt;
Through Emily, Pale-Moon narrates the compelling story of her peoples struggle
to maintain a harmonious existence within a world teetering on the brink of
transfi guration.&lt;p&gt;
BARBIERIS previous works of fiction&lt;I&gt;Tales
From the Soft Underbelly of Confusion,&lt;/I&gt; a collection
of short stories, and &lt;I&gt;Tree Of Dreams,&lt;/I&gt; a
novelwere published by iuiverse in 2007 and
2009 respectively.&lt;p&gt;
Peter Barbieri received his doctorate in Music
Composition from the University of Colorado,
Boulder. He completed his post-doctoral studies
with Luciano Berio in Florence, Italy.&lt;p&gt;
For the past twenty-fi ve years, Barbieri has been
touring the United States and Europe as pianist/
accompanist for the Nancy Spanier Dance Company.
Currently, Dr. Barbieri is the executive director
of the ijamjazz summer jazz camp in Bonefro,
Italy and teaches Jazz Th eory and Improvisation
in Boulder, Colorado.&lt;p&gt;" />
