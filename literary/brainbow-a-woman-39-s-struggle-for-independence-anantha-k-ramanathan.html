  <title>bRAINBOW: A woman&#39;s struggle for independence - Anantha K Ramanathan</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;This is an elderly woman&amp;rsquo;s struggle to stay independent and her family&amp;rsquo;s efforts to keep her safe. There are lots of twists and turns.&lt;br /&gt; She thought &amp;lsquo;I have always told them what I see and what I think. They don&amp;#39;t see what I see. They don&amp;#39;t think the way I think. Maybe I am seeing aliens. Maybe I am seeing ghosts. How can they deny my experience? My experience is my existence. When they deny my experience they are denying my existence.&amp;rsquo;&lt;br /&gt; &amp;quot;Mother looks and acts normally most of the time. But occasionally she does weird things&amp;quot; said Nicholas. As for the noises was she hearing certain pitches louder than usual? Was there a problem with her ears? Or was she hallucinating? Or, is there truth in her belief that dad will come back to visit her? Is that why things are getting lost and found? Or is the neighbor really doing nasty things? It was a mystery.&lt;br /&gt; &amp;ldquo;This is getting weirder and weirder! Is she getting more paranoid as the day goes? Is she depressed? Is she hallucinating? Or is there a real ghost in the apartment? Even if there was a ghost will it be seen on CCTV footage?&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt; Whether you are a millennial or a baby boomer or neither, you will relate to this enthralling and emotional story. It will take you through a million emotions.&lt;br /&gt; Diana has been a mystery to her family as they try to work through her issues and find a solution. At each stage there is an unexpected event. Is everyone happy ever after? Read the novel to find out. It is very real and it is all around you.&lt;br /&gt; It is a must read if you have parents and a heart.&lt;/p&gt;" />
