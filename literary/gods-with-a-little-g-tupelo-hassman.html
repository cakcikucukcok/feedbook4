  <title>gods with a little g - Tupelo Hassman</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&quot;Triumphant . . . as heartwarming as it is beautifully written.&quot; --Michael Schaub, NPR&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;From the acclaimed author of &lt;i&gt;Girlchild&lt;/i&gt;, this gritty, irreverent novel sees a young misfit grow into hope&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unsinkable and wrecked by grief, motherless and aimless and looking for connection, Helen Dedleder is a girl with a gift she doesn&#39;t want to use and a pack of friends who are all just helping each other get by. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So cut off from the rest of the world that even the internet is blocked (never mind traffic in and out), Rosary, California, is run by evangelicals but was named by Catholics. It&#39;s a town on very formal relations with its neighbors, one that boasts an oil refinery as well as a fairly sizable population of teenagers. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For Helen and her gang of misfits, the tire yard, sex, and beer help pass the days until they turn eighteen and leave town. Her best friends, Win and Rainbolene, late arrivals to Rosary, are particularly keen to depart--Rain because she&#39;ll finally be able to get the hormones she needs to fully become herself. Watching over them is Aunt Bev, an outcast like the kids, who runs the barely tolerated Psychic Encounter Shoppe and tries to keep Helen connected to her own psychic talents--a gift passed down from her mother. Tensions are building, though, in every way. Threats against the Psychic Encounter Shoppe become serious actions. One of the kids gets in trouble, and then another. And Helen can see some things before they happen, but somehow can&#39;t see the most important things happening right in front of her. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tupelo Hassman&#39;s &lt;i&gt;gods with a little g &lt;/i&gt;bursts and splinters with flawed, lovable characters whose haphazard investigations into each others&#39;s hearts will reshape your understanding of trust, how to build a family, and how to make a future you can see.&lt;/p&gt;" />
