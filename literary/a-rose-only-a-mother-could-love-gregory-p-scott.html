  <title>A Rose Only a Mother Could Love - Gregory P. Scott</title>
      <meta name="description" content="These ten stories, plus one bonus, take place in Everytown, USA; in other words, the stories in this collection could take place in your backyard or on the other side of America. Still, no matter where you go, people are people, and they face the same daily struggles and horrific life tragedies but also joy, laughter, and redemption.
Read of one boy who spent his life growing up in a poor household until the thrill of a day at the fancy Dairy Queen. Attend a childs funeral, arranged and organized by the child herself. Find a family less than thankful on Thanksgiving and a Marine who receives a less than welcome homecoming, despite brave service to his country.
Meet characters like Steady Stuart and good old Pete the Pennyman. These charactersand the tales themselveswill provoke, amuse, and enthrall. Youll be left guessing how many of these stories are true and which are works of pure fiction, but actually, it doesnt matter, since real life is the strangest story of them all." />
