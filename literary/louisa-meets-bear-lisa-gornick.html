  <title>Louisa Meets Bear - Lisa Gornick</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;When Louisa and Bear meet at Princeton in 1975, sparks fly. Louisa is the sexually adventurous daughter of a geneticist, Bear the volatile son of a plumber. They dive headfirst into a passionate affair that will alter the course of their lives, changing how they define themselves in the years and relationships that follow. Lisa Gornick&#39;s &lt;i&gt;Louisa Meets Bear &lt;/i&gt;is a gripping novel in interconnected stories from an author whose work &quot;starts off like a brush fire and then engulfs and burns with fury&quot; (&lt;i&gt;The Huffington Post&lt;/i&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reading &lt;i&gt;Louisa Meets Bear &lt;/i&gt;is like assembling a jigsaw puzzle, as we uncover the subtle and startling connections between new characters and the star-crossed lovers. We meet a daughter who stabs her mother when she learns the truth about her father, a wife who sees herself clearly after finding a man dead on her office floor, a mother who discovers a girl in her teenage son&#39;s bed. Each character is striking, each rendered with Gornick&#39;s trademark sympathy and psychological acuity. We follow them over the course of a half century, from San Francisco to New York City and from Guatemala to Venice, through pregnancies, tragedies, and revelations, until we return to Louisa and Bear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With flawed and deeply human characters, and piercing insight into the lives of women, &lt;i&gt;Louisa Meets Bear &lt;/i&gt;grapples with whether we can--or can&#39;t--choose how and whom we love.&lt;/p&gt;" />
