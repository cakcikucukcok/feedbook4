  <title>The Secret Diary of Hendrik Groen - Hendrik Groen, Hester Velmans</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;b&gt;A #1 international bestseller in the vein of Fredrik Backman&#39;s &lt;i&gt;A Man Called Ove: &lt;/i&gt;a funny and tender-hearted tale about friendship, love, and an old man who is young at heart.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;Technically speaking, Hendrik Groen is....elderly. But at age 83 1/4, this feisty, indomitable curmudgeon has no plans to go out quietly. Bored of weak tea and potted geraniums, exasperated by the indignities of aging, Hendrik has decided to rebel - on his own terms. He begins writing an exposé: secretly recording the antics of day-to-day life in his retirement home, where he refuses to take himself, or his fellow &quot;inmates,&quot; too seriously.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;With an eccentric group of friends, he founds the wickedly anarchic Old-But-Not-Dead Club, and he and his best friend, Evert, gleefully stir up trouble, enraging the home&#39;s humorless director and turning themselves into unlikely heroes. And when a sweet and sassy widow moves in next door, he polishes his shoes, grooms what&#39;s left of his hair, and determines to savor every ounce of joy in the time he has left, with hilarious and tender consequences.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;A bestselling phenomenon that has captured imaginations around the world, &lt;i&gt;The Secret Diary of Hendrik Groen&lt;/i&gt; is inspiring, charming, and laugh-out-loud funny with a deep and poignant core: a page-turning delight for readers of any age.&lt;/div&gt;" />
