        &lt;p&gt;Boardrooms of Power Collection&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;Six sexy romances that involve powerful, brooding tycoons. There’s a thin line between business and pleasure…&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;THE ITALIAN BOSS’S SECRETARY MISTRESS by Cathy Williams&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To arrogant Italian Gabriel Gessi, Rose has always been his plain, sensible secretary. But when she returns from vacation with a stunning new look, Gabriel decides he wants to take her out of the boardroom and into his bedroom!&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;UNDER THE TYCOON’S PROTECTION by Anna DePalo&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Security tycoon Connor Rafferty was employed to safeguard prosecutor Allison Whittaker. Connor’s barely restrained ardour should have been her warning not to take him into her home, mere footsteps from her bedroom. After all, he featured prominently in all her fantasies…&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BUSINESS AFFAIRS by Shirley Rogers&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;An impulsive bid at a bachelor auction had won Jennifer Cardon a romantic getaway with her sexy boss, Alex Dunnigan. Jennifer had always been incredibly attracted to Alex, but bedroom fantasies were one thing—having her dreams come true in the flesh was quite another.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BOUGHT BY A MILLIONAIRE by Heidi Betts&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Chicago&#39;s Most Eligible Bachelor, Burke Bishop, wanted a child—but didn&#39;t want to be shackled by marriage. Surrogacy seemed the only solution. When he met gorgeous Shannon Moriarity he knew he&#39;d found the perfect mother for his baby and requested they keep things strictly business!&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;THE BOSS AND HIS SECRETARY by Jessica Steele&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Taryn takes a job as secretary to millionaire Jake, she is already fighting her attraction to him. Taryn is determined not to mix business and pleasure, so tries to keep her distance. But then Jake asks her for her help after hours!&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MARRYING HER BILLIONAIRE by Myrna Mackenzie&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Carson Banick: The black sheep of the family is back–and now his family&#39;s future and fortune are in his hands. He must marry a suitable woman and provide an heir. Beth Krayton shouldn’t be the one: Carson&#39;s feisty PA is determined to succeed on her own, without a man…&lt;/p&gt;
