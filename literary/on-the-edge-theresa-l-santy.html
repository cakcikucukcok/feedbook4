  <title>On the Edge - Theresa L Santy</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;For as long as she can remember, Kristen Craemer has been running from something. In high school and college, she ran competitively, until her Olympic dreams were shattered. Now, she runs to escape&amp;mdash;from her past, from intimacy, from reality, and from the cold, black mist that haunts her nights.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Desperate to stop running, she turns to therapy, alcohol, and pills&amp;mdash;anything to dull the fear&amp;mdash;but her struggle intensifies with every passing night. Gradually, the nightmares encroach on her days, until everything she holds dear slips further away.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Kristen&amp;rsquo;s fears increase when she meets Ethan, a bronze-eyed Jesus freak. The claims he makes about God are too unbelievable to be true, and to Kristen they are more terrifying than her recurring dreams. She can&amp;rsquo;t open her heart to Ethan, and she won&amp;rsquo;t open her heart to his faith. Instead, Kristen keeps running, and every time she runs she finds herself standing at the shore of the Pacific Ocean, glaring into the crashing waves and fighting the urge to submerge herself beneath the turbulent water forever.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;On the Edge&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;is the powerful story of a &amp;ldquo;girl next door&amp;rdquo; who struggled to make it out of childhood alive, only to drown daily in shame and fear . . . until she finally dives over the edge and into redemption.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;" />
