  <title>Motherhood - Sheila Heti</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;From the author of &lt;i&gt;How Should a Person Be? &lt;/i&gt;(&quot;one of the most talked-about books of the year&quot;--&lt;i&gt;Time Magazine&lt;/i&gt;) and the &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; Bestseller &lt;i&gt;Women in Clothes&lt;/i&gt; comes a daring novel about whether to have children.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/b&gt;In &lt;i&gt;Motherhood, &lt;/i&gt;Sheila Heti asks what is gained and what is lost when a woman becomes a mother, treating the most consequential decision of early adulthood with the candor, originality, and humor that have won Heti international acclaim and made &lt;i&gt;How Should A Person Be?&lt;/i&gt; required reading for a generation.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In her late thirties, when her friends are asking &lt;i&gt;when &lt;/i&gt;they will become mothers, the narrator of Heti&#39;s intimate and urgent novel considers whether she will do so at all. In a narrative spanning several years, casting among the influence of her peers, partner, and her duties to her forbearers, she struggles to make a wise and moral choice. After seeking guidance from philosophy, her body, mysticism, and chance, she discovers her answer much closer to home.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;Motherhood &lt;/i&gt;is a courageous, keenly felt, and starkly original novel that will surely spark lively conversations about womanhood, parenthood, and about how--and for whom--to live.&lt;/p&gt;" />
