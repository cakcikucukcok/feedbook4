  <title>The Gypsy Moth Summer - Julia Fierro</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&quot;Fierro doesn&#39;t just observe, she &lt;i&gt;knows&lt;/i&gt;. Like all great novelists, she gives us the world.&quot; - Amy Bloom, bestselling author of &lt;i&gt;Away&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Lucky Us&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is the summer of 1992 and a gypsy moth invasion blankets Avalon Island. Ravenous caterpillars disrupt early summer serenity on Avalon, an islet off the coast of Long Island--dropping onto novels left open on picnic blankets, crawling across the T-shirts of children playing games of tag and capture the flag in the island&#39;s leafy woods. The caterpillars become a relentless topic of island conversation and the inescapable soundtrack of the season. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is also the summer Leslie Day Marshall--only daughter of Avalon&#39;s most prominent family--returns with her husband, a botanist, and their children to live in &quot;The Castle,&quot; the island&#39;s grandest estate.  Leslie&#39;s husband Jules is African-American, and their children bi-racial, and islanders from both sides of the tracks form fast and dangerous opinions about the new arrivals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Maddie Pencott LaRosa straddles those tracks: a teen queen with roots in the tony precincts of East Avalon and the crowded working class corner of West Avalon, home to Grudder Aviation factory, the island&#39;s bread-and-butter and birthplace of generations of bombers and war machines. Maddie falls in love with Brooks, Leslie&#39;s and Jules&#39; son, and that love feels as urgent to Maddie as the questions about the new and deadly cancers showing up across the island. Could Grudder Aviation, the pride of the island--and its patriarch, the Colonel--be to blame?  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the gypsy moths burst from cocoons in flocks that seem to eclipse the sun, Maddie&#39;s and Brooks&#39; passion for each other grows and she begins planning a life for them off Avalon Island.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vivid with young lovers, gangs of anxious outsiders; a plotting aged matriarch and her husband, a demented military patriarch; and a troubled young boy, each seeking his or her own refuge, escape and revenge, &lt;i&gt;The Gypsy Moth Summer &lt;/i&gt;is about love, gaps in understanding, and the struggle to connect: within families; among friends; between neighbors and entire generations.&lt;/p&gt;" />
