  <title>See What I Have Done - Sarah Schmidt</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;EM&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Lizzie Borden took an axe&lt;BR&gt;And gave her mother forty whacks.&lt;BR&gt;When she saw what she had done, &lt;BR&gt;She gave her father forty-one.&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Or did she?&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;In this riveting debut novel, &lt;EM&gt;See What I Have Done&lt;/EM&gt;, Sarah Schmidt recasts one of the most spellbinding murder cases of all time into a sensitive and humane portrait of two sisters caught inside a volatile household—and what it means to be free and truly loved.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;On the morning of August 4, 1892, Lizzie Borden calls out to her maid Bridget: &lt;EM&gt;Someone’s killed father&lt;/EM&gt;. The discovery of the brutal axe-murders of Andrew and Abby Borden under their own roof in Fall River, Massachusetts paralyzes the small community. No one can understand why anyone would want to harm the respected Bordens. But secret witnesses to the crime have a different tale to tell—of a father with an explosive temper; a spiteful step-mother; and two spinster sisters, with a bond even stronger than blood, desperate for their independence.  &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;As the police search for clues, Emma comforts an increasingly distraught Lizzie whose memories flash in scattered fragments. Had she been in the barn or the pear arbor to escape the stifling heat of the house? Before or after she last spoke to her stepmother? Were they really gone and would everything be better now?  Through the overlapping perspectives of the unreliable Lizzie, her older sister Emma, the housemaid Bridget, and the enigmatic stranger Benjamin, we return to what happened on that fateful day.&lt;/DIV&gt;" />
