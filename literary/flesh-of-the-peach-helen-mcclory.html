  <title>Flesh of the Peach - Helen McClory</title>
      <meta name="description" content="An intense journey into and out of rage and grief, via sex and violence, following 27 year-old artist, Sarah Browne and set mostly in the American Southwest. In New York, the ending of Sarah&#39;s recent relationship with a married woman has coincided with the death of her estranged, aristocratic mother, leaving her a substantial amount of money and an unrecognised burden of toxic grief. Rather than return home to England, she decides to travel by Greyhound to her mother&#39;s cabin in New Mexico. There she&#39;s drawn into a passionate relationship with Theo, a man whose quiet stability seems to complement her mercurial character. But as Sarah&#39;s emotional turmoil grows, there are warning signs that tragedy could ensue. In Flesh of the Peach Scottish First Book of the Year winner, Helen McClory, paints a beautiful and painful portrait of a woman&#39;s unravelling, combining exquisite, and at times experimental, prose with a powerful understanding of the effects of unresolved loss. McClory is one of the most exciting literary talents to emerge from Scotland in recent years." />
