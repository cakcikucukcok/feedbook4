  <title>Greasewood Creek - Pamela Steele</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;Avery is no stranger to the weight of loss, the way it shapes and defines the expanse of a life.  The death of her sister, when Avery was just a child herself, engulfed her and her family&amp;#151;a mother driven mad, a father who disappeared, and all the while, neighbors and friends ignoring and surviving. The loss shades Avery&amp;#8217;s full being, becoming a deep part of her past and her future.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;As a young woman, Avery&amp;#8217;s life in Eastern Oregon ranch country is filled with an acquired family: her partner Davis Lovell, a ranch hand and father figure; Lennie, Lovell&amp;#8217;s daughter; and Davis&amp;#8217;s grandparents. When Avery suffers the loss of her and Davis&amp;#8217;s newborn child, it triggers and revives in her a familiar sense of guilt, one she has carried since childhood over the disintegration of her family.&lt;br&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Written with the precision of Cynthia Ozick and the blunt passion of Alice Munro, this riveting story takes place on a landscape&amp;#151;the deserts of Eastern Oregon&amp;#151;itself a deeply important character in this remarkable first novel.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;" />
