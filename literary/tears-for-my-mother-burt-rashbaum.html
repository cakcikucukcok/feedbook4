  <title>Tears for My Mother - Burt Rashbaum</title>
      <meta name="description" content="A heart-bruising dive into the terror of Alzheimers. This memoir-like tale told through the eyes of a care-giving daughter and the clouded mind of her declining mother had me racing to the final page. Rashbaum cleverly weaves these two views of this harrowing journey through inner thoughts and honest dialogue to paint an un-Norman Rockwell portrait of one familys struggle with this horrible disease.&lt;p&gt;
-Jay Gilbertson, author of Moon Over Madeline Island and Back to Madeline Island &lt;p&gt;
Penning from the internal landscape of another is difficult enough, but doing so from the mind of a mentally tormented soul, with all the nuances of such complexity, is beyond comprehension. This is what Burt Rashbaum has accomplished in his brilliant portrayal of his mother as she experiences the devastation of Alzheimers. Not to sound too otherworldly about this, I do believe she must have guided Burt from beyond for the portrayal to have been so heartbreakingly accurate. A must read for all!&lt;p&gt;
-Peggy Warren, author of &lt;i&gt;Very Much a Womans Book and Gathering Peace&lt;/i&gt; &lt;p&gt;" />
