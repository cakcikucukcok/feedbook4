  <title>The Bachelor&#39;s Northbridge Bride (Mills &amp; Boon Vintage Cherish) - Victoria Pade</title>
      <meta name="description" content="
        &lt;p&gt;When it came to finding her dream husband, Kate Perry had struck out three times. One thing she knew for sure: he &lt;em&gt;wasn&#39;t&lt;/em&gt; Ry Grayson. The devilishly handsome, fun-loving daredevil was wrong for her in every way. So what was it about Ry that made Kate yearn to get to know the man behind the sexy thrill seeker?&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Ry came home to Northbridge to help solve the mystery of his grandmother&#39;s past. It certainly &lt;em&gt;wasn&#39;t&lt;/em&gt; to hook up with this prim and proper therapist who wasn&#39;t at all his type–not even close. But once Kate let down her hair–that fabulous red hair–once she showed him her passionate side, anything was possible. Even convincing her to walk down the aisle with him?&lt;/p&gt;
