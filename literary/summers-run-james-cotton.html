  <title>Summers Run - James Cotton</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Eleven-year-old Claude Kinkade considers himself an orphan of sorts. His father, Major Blake Kinkade, died in the Gulf War, 1991. Now single, Claudes mother Daisy, moves to Las Vegas to pursue a singing career, leaving Claude with relatives on a Pennsylvania farm.&lt;p&gt;
In Pennsylvania, Claude meets his illustrious cousin, Nathean Summers, a former child actor and television star. Nathe first appeared before the cameras in 1954 at age eight. His meteoric rise toward stardom sputtered; by the late 1960s his films were forgotten. After a turbulent career in publishing, he returns to the family farm to recover remnants of his boyhood and begin life anew in Summers Run.&lt;p&gt; 
Claudes and Nathes lives entwine as they forge their futures, and  together, they form a Little League team for the farm boys of the township. Soon they encounter Standing Ovation, the legendary bull of the neighborhood; Parsimonious Murphy, the reluctant recluse; and Tim Hathaway, the deaf orphan who wants to shine in center field. &lt;p&gt; 
Claude thrives on his aunt&#39;s farm, taking on chores, responsibilities, and &quot;making a hand&quot; around the place. However, Claude&#39;s mother expects Claude to move to Nevada to be with her and her parents, now retired from the USAF.  Whose wisdom will decide his future?&lt;p&gt;
The story of Claude and Nathe depicts the dreams and realities of coaching and parenting along the back roads of rural America and especially Summers Run." />
