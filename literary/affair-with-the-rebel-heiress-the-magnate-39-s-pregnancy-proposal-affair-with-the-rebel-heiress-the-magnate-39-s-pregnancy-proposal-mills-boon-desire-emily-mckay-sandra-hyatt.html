          &lt;strong&gt;Affair with the Rebel Heiress&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;When Texas businessman Ford Langley researched his mystery lover, he discovered Kitty Biedermann was heiress to a jewellery empire ripe for the picking. It was the perfect opportunity for Ford to move boardroom discussions into the bedroom! But Kitty wasn’t about to fall into his arms and thank him. She was determined to fight him tooth and nail!&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;The Magnate’s Pregnancy Proposal&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Chastity Stevens was carrying a Masters child…but not from the brother she thought. When Chastity revealed she was pregnant by her late husband, millionaire Gabe Masters knew the child was his. Now he would do whatever it took to claim the child she carried – their child – as his own.&lt;/p&gt;
