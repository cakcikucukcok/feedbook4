  <title>Lola Bensky - Lily Brett</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;Lola Bensky is a nineteen-year-old rock journalist who irons her hair straight and asks a lot of questions. A high-school dropout, she&#39;s not sure how she got the job &amp;#150; but she&#39;s been sent by her Australian newspaper right to the heart of the London music scene at the most exciting time in music history: 1967.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Lola spends her days planning diets and interviewing rock stars. In London, Mick Jagger makes her a cup of tea, Jimi Hendrix (possibly) propositions her and Cher borrows her false eyelashes. At the Monterey International Pop Festival, Lola props up Brian Jones and talks to Janis Joplin about sex. In Los Angeles, she discusses being overweight with Mama Cass and tries to pluck up the courage to ask Cher to return those false eyelashes.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Lola has an irrepressible curiosity, but she begins to wonder whether the questions she asks these extraordinary young musicians are really a substitute for questions about her parents&#39; calamitous past that can&#39;t be asked or answered. As Lola moves on through marriage, motherhood, psychoanalysis and a close relationship with an unexpected pair of detectives, she discovers the question of what it means to be human is the hardest one for anyone&amp;#151;including herself&amp;#151;to answer.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/div&gt;" />
