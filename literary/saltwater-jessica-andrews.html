  <title>Saltwater - Jessica Andrews</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&quot;Andrews&#39;s writing is transportingly voluptuous, conjuring tastes and smells and sounds like her literary godmother, Edna O&#39;Brien . . . What makes her novel sing is its universal themes: how a young woman tries to make sense of her world, and how she grows up.&quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;-Penelope Green, &lt;/b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;The New York Times Book Review&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;br&gt;This &quot;luminous&quot; (&lt;i&gt;The&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;Observer&lt;/i&gt;) feminist coming-of-age novel captures in sensuous, blistering prose the richness and imperfection of the bond between a daughter and her mother&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;i&gt;It begins with our bodies . . . Safe together in the violet dark and yet already there are spaces beginning to open between us.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;From that first immaculate, fluid connection, through the ups and downs of a working-class childhood in northern England, the one constant in Lucy&#39;s life has been her mother: comforting and mysterious, ferociously loving, tirelessly devoted, as much a part of Lucy as her own skin. Her mother&#39;s lessons in womanhood shape Lucy&#39;s appreciation for desire, her sense of duty as a caretaker, her hunger for a better, perhaps reckless life.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;At university in glamorous London, Lucy&#39;s background sets her apart. And then she is finished, graduated, adrift. She escapes to a tiny house in Donegal left empty by her grandfather, a place where her mother once found happiness. There she will take a lover, live inside art and the past, and track back through her memories and her mother&#39;s stories to make sense of her place in the world.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In &quot;a stunning new voice in British literary fiction&quot; (&lt;i&gt;The Independent&lt;/i&gt;) that lays bare our raw, dark selves, Jessica Andrews&#39;s debut honors the richness and imperfection of the bond between a daughter and her mother. Intricately woven in lyrical vignettes, &lt;i&gt;Saltwater&lt;/i&gt; is a novel of becoming-- a woman, an artist-- and of finding a way forward by looking back.&lt;/p&gt;" />
