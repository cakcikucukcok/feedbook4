  <title>The Sky, the Stars, the Wilderness - Rick Bass</title>

Her mother, who died when she was a child, is buried there; the three men who raised her&amp;mdash;her father, grandfather, and Old Chubb, a Mexican ranch hand&amp;mdash;are gone; and her brother, like herself, is childless. Soon, all that will be left of the family is the land: &amp;ldquo;I suppose the land is all we will leave behind,&amp;rdquo; she reflects. &amp;ldquo;In that way it is both our parents and our children.&amp;rdquo;&lt;BR /&gt; &amp;#160;&lt;BR /&gt; Land is central to the other tales here as well. In &lt;I&gt;The Myths of Bears&lt;/I&gt;, a man tracks his wife through a winter wilderness as she both lures and eludes him. And in &lt;I&gt;Where the Sea Used to Be&lt;/I&gt;, an ancient ocean buried in the foothills of the Appalachians becomes a battleground for a young wildcat oilman and his aging mentor.&lt;BR /&gt; &amp;#160;&lt;BR /&gt; &amp;ldquo;Rick Bass is a force of nature. [This book] is a force of language. As a reader, a third thing comes to mind: gratitude for a good story that allows us to ponder what is above and what is below.&amp;rdquo; &amp;mdash;Terry Tempest Williams&lt;BR /&gt; &amp;#160;&lt;BR /&gt; &amp;ldquo;What&amp;rsquo;s exhilarating about Rick Bass&amp;rsquo;s stories is that they show every hallmark of &amp;lsquo;the natural&amp;rsquo;&amp;mdash;that lucid, free-flowing, particularly American talent whose voice we can hear in Twain, Fitzgerald, and Hemingway.&amp;rdquo; &amp;mdash;&lt;I&gt;Chicago Tribune&lt;/I&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;" />
