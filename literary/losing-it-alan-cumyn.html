  <title>Losing It - Alan Cumyn</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Sometimes those who have the most seem bent on throwing it away. Meet Bob Sterling, a comfortable middle-aged professor, a specialist in the life of Edgar Allan Poe, married to a former student with whom he has a young son. In the space of a week his family, marriage, home, career, sanity, and life are brought to the brink of ruin in the aftermath of a trip he makes with a student, the intense young poet Sienna Chu, who brings to life Bob&#39;s long-harbored sexual fetish. Add to the mix the misadventures of his wife&#39;s mentally failing mother and Sienna&#39;s explosive techno-junkie roommate, and you have Alan Cumyn&#39;s strikingly accomplished novel &lt;i&gt;Losing It&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whether describing an Alzheimer sufferer, a fetishist, a twisted poet, or a young mother whose life is suddenly spinning out of control, Cumyn reveals the eccentric sub-surfaces of our lives. Poignant, gritty, and tantalizingly erotic, &lt;i&gt;Losing It&lt;/i&gt; is a high-wire act that plays out as an irresistible blend of darkness and humor.&lt;/p&gt;" />
