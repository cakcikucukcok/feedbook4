  <title>A Place to Stop - Susan Wicks</title>
      <meta name="description" content="In an idyllic village in south-west France, a web of lives interconnect, ready to unravel at the first touch. Alex is running from a teenage love-affair that went badly wrong at home in England. Julien, the retired village schoolmaster, is struggling with loneliness and insomnia. Pete has everything - a wife who loves him, an existence of ease and freedom - yet he&#39;s frightened of something. Magali wants so much more than the life her parents had. And Damien&#39;s angry with all of it. And then through their world passes a walker, or a pilgrim, on the old Santiago de Compostela pilgrim path. He accidentally moves a rock a couple of metres and continues on his way. And by the time he has travelled a few more slow days towards Santiago, the lives of every inhabitant of this small community will be irrevocably changed." />
