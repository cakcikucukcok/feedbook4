      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;Tall, trusted Tandy Caide, CPA, is a long-time patron of the arts in her town, which is why you will find her sitting in the front row of the high school&amp;#8217;s annual musical production. This year is an Annie year&amp;#151;and it would be no different than other years were it not for the high school&amp;#8217;s hiring of a new vocational agriculture (Vo-Ag) teacher. With his beguiling ponytail and decorative beaded belt, Kenny catches Tandy&amp;#8217;s eye immediately. Ignoring the fact of her slovenly husband&amp;#151;who takes most of his meals in their hot tub&amp;#151;Tandy decides to entertain Kenny&amp;#8217;s advances.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Trusted community pillar that she is, Tandy&amp;#8217;s affair has instant repercussions. People are talking and her husband&amp;#8217;s subsequent breakdown and check-in to a mental institution doesn&amp;#8217;t help. At her regular meeting with the Order of the Pessimists&amp;#151;comprised of her deceased father&amp;#8217;s disgruntled and drunken best friends&amp;#151;she is asked to step down as treasurer. Not only that, but her old lover is keeping a secret somehow connected to the Vo-Ag teacher. And meth labs&amp;#151;fueled by the abundance of fertilizer present in the region&amp;#151;keep blowing up.  Somehow, it is all connected to Tandy&amp;#8217;s ex-bestfriend&amp;#8217;s daughter&amp;#151;the star of this year&amp;#8217;s Annie.  As Tandy pieces together the puzzle that has become her life, it becomes clear she must embark on a journey of self-discovery that might even include leaving town for good.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;" />
