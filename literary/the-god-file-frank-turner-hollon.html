  <title>The God File - Frank Turner Hollon</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Gabriel Black is sentenced to prison for a murder he did not commit. In a twisted expression of honor, he takes responsibility for the action of a women he loves and pays with his freedom.
Black stumbles upon a &quot;proof&quot; of God, one involving the solving of somebody&#39;s cancer. He decides a better &quot;proof&quot; of God would be to verify His existence in a place like the prison he&#39;s in--disgusting, violent, hopeless.
Gabriel creates a file where he stores any evidence of the divine he comes across no matter how unseemly. In brutal, honest language, The God File recounts the dark comedy of one man&#39;s search for meaning. 
PRAISE FOR THE GOD FILE
“This novel is so thought provoking and real and beautiful that I believe it has changed me forever”
—Silas House, author of Clay&#39;s Quilt and A Parchment of Leaves
“A strong portrait of a man of nobility at odds with circumstances...”
—Kirkus Reviews
2002 Fiction Book of the Year--Independent Publisher Book Awards
PRAISE FOR FRANK TURNER HOLLON
“The Point of Fracture [is] easily Hollon’s most accomplished, probably his best, novel to date...absolutely astonishing.”
—Anniston Star, of The Point of Fracture
“Pack[s] in so much depth...a testament to the author’s ability to spin layers of meaning in deceptively simple prose.”
—Baltimore Sun, of The Wait" />
