  <title>Conrad &amp; Eleanor - Jane Rogers</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;From the multi-award-winning and critically acclaimed author of &lt;em&gt;The Testament of Jessie Lamb&lt;/em&gt; comes this riveting novel about the devastating secrets revealed in the midst of a disintegrating marriage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story of a marriage, and of two lives in science.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Conrad fails to return from a conference, Eleanor wonders if it is because of the affair she is having? Or perhaps it is because his research into transgenic monkey hearts is stalling; perhaps he is sick of having the less successful career of the two of them?&amp;#160; She is a leading expert in stem cell research. Their grown-up children suspect Eleanor of murdering their father; El secretly fears that what has driven Con away is his discovery of their daughter Cara&amp;#8217;s parentage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While his family in Manchester, England, scrabble for clues and reasons, Conrad&amp;#8212;alone, confused, and on the run from a crazed animal rights activist&amp;#8212;loses himself in the cold foggy streets of Bologna. He revisits the stages of his long marriage to El, from the happiness of the year of Cara&amp;#8217;s birth to the grief and anger he now feels. Both partners are forced to re-examine their relationship, and, in the process, to move closer to an understanding of what it is that matters most to each of them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conrad and Eleanor&lt;/em&gt; is a radical, remarkably nuanced look at marriage.&lt;/p&gt;" />
