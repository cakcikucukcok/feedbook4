  <title>Class Mom - Laurie Gelman</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Laurie Gelman&#39;s clever debut novel about a year in the life of a kindergarten class mom--a brilliant send-up of the petty and surprisingly cutthroat terrain of parent politics.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Jen Dixon is not your typical Kansas City kindergarten class mom--or mom in general. Jen already has two college-age daughters by two different (probably) musicians, and it&#39;s her second time around the class mom block with five-year-old Max--this time with a husband and father by her side. Though her best friend and PTA President sees her as the &quot;wisest&quot; candidate for the job (or oldest), not all of the other parents agree.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; From recording parents&#39; response times to her emails about helping in the classroom, to requesting contributions of &quot;special&quot; brownies for curriculum night, not all of Jen&#39;s methods win approval from the other moms. Throw in an old flame from Jen&#39;s past, a hyper-sensitive &quot;allergy mom,&quot; a surprisingly sexy kindergarten teacher, and an impossible-to-please Real Housewife-wannabe, causing problems at every turn, and the job really becomes much more than she signed up for. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Relatable, irreverent, and hilarious in the spirit of Maria Semple, &lt;i&gt;Class Mom&lt;/i&gt; is a fresh, welcome voice in fiction--the kind of novel that real moms clamor for, and a vicarious thrill-read for all mothers, who will be laughing as they are liberated by Gelman&#39;s acerbic truths.&lt;/p&gt;" />
