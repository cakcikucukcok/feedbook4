  <title>It&#39;s All About The Moon When The Sun Ain&#39;t Shining - Ernest Hill</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;b&gt;&quot;Hill offers a poignant portrait of a young man at a crossroads, struggling with the true meaning of love and torn between the pleadings of the women in his life.&quot; &amp;#8212;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Booklist&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Maurice Dupree is the first person in his family to go to college, and now he&#39;s on his way to becoming the first African American attorney in his hometown. If only the woman he loved, the woman he&#39;d hoped to marry since high school, were as happy for him as everyone else is.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Omenita Jones isn&#39;t planning on waiting three more minutes, much less three more years, to start her life with Maurice. If he wants to go to law school, that&#39;s fine. But she won&#39;t be waiting when he&#39;s finished.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Feeling more alone than ever, Maurice finds an unexpected ally in a young white woman. Danielle Davenport is the daughter of an influential judge. Maurice&#39;s mother is the Davenports&#39; longtime housekeeper. As his friendship with this compassionate woman grows, she becomes a source of strength when he makes a stunning choice, one that will put everything&amp;#8212;and everyone&amp;#8212;he believes in to the test.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/b&gt;" />
