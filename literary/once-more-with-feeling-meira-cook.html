      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Finalist, The Margaret Laurence Award for Fiction&lt;br/&gt;
        Winner, Carol Shields Winnipeg Book Award&lt;br/&gt;
        Finalist, McNally Robinson Book of the Year Award&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
After twenty years Max Binder is still in love with his fiery wife, Maggie, and is determined to get her the perfect fortieth birthday gift. But Max&amp;#8217;s singular desire &amp;#8212; to make his wife happy &amp;#8212; leads to an unexpected event that changes the course of his family&amp;#8217;s life and touches the people who make up their western prairie city.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Set over the course of a single year, &lt;em&gt;Once More With Feeling&lt;/em&gt; tells the story of a community through intersecting moments and interconnected lives. The colourful citizens who make up this city &amp;#8212; bisected by railway lines and rivers, connected by boulevards and back alleys &amp;#8212; are marked by transformation, upheaval, and loss: the worker at a downtown soup kitchen who recognizes a kindred spirit amongst the homeless; the aging sisters who everywhere see the fleeting ghosts of two missing neighbourhood children; a communal voice of mothers anxious for the future of their children in the discomfiting world they inhabit &amp;#8212; this place of memory, amnesia, longing, and belonging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Featuring a cast of eclectic characters, &lt;em&gt;Once More With Feeling&lt;/em&gt; is about a community, about a family, and about the way time makes fond fools of us all. Award-winning author M&amp;#233;ira Cook has crafted a novel that is at once funny, poignant, and yes, full of feeling.&lt;/p&gt;" />
