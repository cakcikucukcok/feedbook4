  <title>The Insistent Garden - Rosie Chard</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&quot;&lt;p&gt;Edith Stoker&#39;s father is building a wall in their backyard. A very, very high wall--a brick bulwark in his obsessive war against their hated neighbour Edward Black.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It is 1969, and far away, preparations are being made for man to walk upon the moon. Meanwhile, in the Stokers&#39; shabby home in the East Midlands, Edith remains a virtual prisoner, with occasional visits from her grotesque and demanding Aunt Vivian serving as the only break in the routine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But when shy, sheltered Edith begins to quietly cultivate a garden in the shadow of her father&#39;s wall, she sets in motion events that might gain her independence... and bring her face to face with the mysterious Edward Black.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rosie Chard&#39;s followup to her award-winning debut &lt;i&gt;Seal Intestine Raincoat&lt;/i&gt; unfolds like a grown-up take on &lt;i&gt;The Secret Garden&lt;i&gt;, an engrossing, often mordantly funny portrait of a young woman who miraculously finds her own pathway to freedom within the most stifling of environs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;Praise to &lt;i&gt;The Insistent Garden&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&quot;Blood feuds and family secrets boil under the respectable surface of 1960s small town England in Chard&#39;s second novel ...

[i]t evolves quietly into a cross between rosy mystery and romance that carries its sheltered protagonist to the threshold of the bigger world.&quot;&lt;br&gt;~ Dave Williamson, &lt;i&gt;Winnipeg Free Press&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&quot;If you take nothing away from &lt;i&gt;The Insistent Garden&lt;/i&gt; other than the desire to plant a bed of blue flowers and a feeling of deep unease, you will know the conflicted heart of Edith Stoker, and Chard will have done her job.&quot;&lt;br&gt;~ Angela Hickman, &lt;i&gt;National Post&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&quot;The novel is populated by baroque characters, vivid in their oddity, but they are not allowed to distract us from Edith, for this is the story of a lonely, marginalized individual in transition, the beginning of the rest of a life.&quot;&lt;br&gt;~ Margaret Thompson, &lt;i&gt;The Coastal Spectator&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />
