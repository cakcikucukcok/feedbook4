  <title>The Way Brilliant Souls Cry - Colin Zwiebel</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The protagonist in &lt;I&gt;The Way Brilliant Souls Cry&lt;/I&gt; is a great performer and artist who wants only to love-and to be loved in return. But his relationship with the mentally wrecked, bipolar Katrina threatens to destroy him.&lt;/p&gt;
Following one of his shows, the artist is approached by Katrina&#39;s father, Richard. The man makes a plea for the artist to visit Katrina in the hospital-claiming that he is the only one who can bring her out of her depression. The artist has always loved her with all his being and agrees to visit her.&lt;/p&gt;
Shortly after, the two troubled souls become engaged and embark on a month long holiday in Europe. Upon their return, he throws himself wholeheartedly into preparing another show. But shortly after the show opens, the couple&#39;s relationship starts to unravel. Katrina and the artist break up and reconcile many times until their final ending is tragically realized.&lt;/p&gt;
This is a story about the human need for love as told from the perspective of the artist&#39;s friend Luna. &lt;I&gt;The Way Brilliant Souls Cry&lt;/I&gt; is the depiction of madness-turned-genius and back again; it examines the gifts that our lives give to other people and illustrates how pain isn&#39;t always easy to recognize.&lt;/p&gt;" />
