  <title>Make Me a City - Jonathan Carr</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;A propulsive debut of visionary scale, &lt;i&gt;Make Me a City&lt;/i&gt; embroiders fact with fiction to tell the story of Chicago&#39;s 19th century, tracing its rise from frontier settlement to industrial colossus.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/b&gt;The tale begins with a game of chess--and on the outcome of that game hinges the destiny of a great city. From appalling injustice springs forth the story of Chicago, and the men and women whose resilience, avarice, and altruism combine to generate a moment of unprecedented civic energy.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A variety of irresistible voices deliver the many strands of this novel: those of Jean Baptiste Pointe de Sable, the long-unheralded founder of Chicago; John Stephen Wright, bombastic speculator and booster; and Antje Hunter, the first woman to report for the &lt;i&gt;Chicago Tribune&lt;/i&gt;. The stories of loggers, miners, engineers, and educators teem around them and each claim the narrative in turns, sharing their grief as well as their delight.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As the characters, and their ancestors, meet and part, as their possessions pass from hand to hand, the reader realizes that Jonathan Carr commands a grand picture, one that encompasses the heartaches of everyday lives as well as the overarching ideals of what a city and a society can and should be&lt;i&gt;. Make Me a City&lt;/i&gt; introduces us to a novelist whose talent and ambition are already fully formed.&lt;/p&gt;" />
