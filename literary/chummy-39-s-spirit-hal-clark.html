  <title>Chummy&#39;s Spirit - Hal Clark</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;I&gt;Chummy&#39;s Spirit&lt;/I&gt; tells the inspirational story of Cordelia &quot;Chummy&quot; Johnson, who learns that the remains of her son, James, have been found in Vietnam 32 years after he was reported missing in action. Chummy has never left Louisiana, but is determined to visit the site where her son&#39;s remains were located. This long-awaited revelation also encourages her to finally inquire about the sketchy details surrounding the death of her husband, who was murdered in a New Orleans brothel ten years after James&#39; disappearance.&lt;/p&gt;
Despite Chummy&#39;s amazing faith and extraordinary psychological resources, and the support of both her church community and other women who have experienced their own tragic losses, her hopes of visiting Vietnam are constantly challenged by her violent, drug-infested New Orleans neighborhood and non-supportive nephew, Bryan, who believes she&#39;s an unrealistic old lady.&lt;/p&gt;
Bryan reluctantly travels with Chummy to Vietnam. There, Mr. Bao Tin, a mysterious, ex-North Vietnamese Army officer, escorts them to Cu Chi, Tay Ninh and Nha Trang, Vietnam. In addition to seeing where James&#39; remains were found, Chummy and Bryan meet the Vietnamese woman that James had planned to marry." />
