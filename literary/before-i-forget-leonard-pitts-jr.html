  <title>Before I Forget - Leonard Pitts, Jr.</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;This powerful novel of three generations of black men bound by blood &amp;#151; and by histories of mutual love, fear, and frustration &amp;#151; gives author Leonard Pitts the opportunity to explore the painful truths of black men&#39;s lives, especially as they play out in the fraught relations of fathers and sons. As 50-year-old Mo tries to reach out to his increasingly tuned-out son Trey (who himself has become an unwed teenaged father), he realizes that the burden of grief and anger he carries over his own estranged father has everything to do with the struggles he encounters with his son. Part road novel, part character study, and part social critique, and written in compulsively readable prose, &lt;I&gt;Before I Forget&lt;/I&gt; is the work of a major new voice in American fiction. Pitts&amp;#160;knows inside and out the difficulties facing black men as they grapple with the complexities of their roles as fathers.&lt;/div&gt;" />
