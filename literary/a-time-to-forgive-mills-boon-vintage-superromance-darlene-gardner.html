          &lt;em&gt;Every moment counts…&lt;/em&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;When Connor Smith has to unexpectedly care for his nine-year-old niece, he isn&#39; t prepared. In fact, he&#39; s overwhelmed. Blending their lives poses one problem after another until Jaye&#39; s violin teacher throws them a lifeline.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Abby Reed not only knows how to get through to his niece, she also makes an impression on him. Soon their time together means everything to Connor–and the tragedy his family faced a decade ago begins to have less power over him. Then he discovers Abby&#39; s family&#39; s connection to his own…&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Can their love survive Connor&#39; s bitterness and Abby&#39; s insistence that her brother isn&#39; t the awful person he&#39; s been branded?&lt;/p&gt;
