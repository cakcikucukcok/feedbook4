  <title>Three Light-Years - Andrea Canobbio, Anne Milano Appel</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Cecilia and Claudio are doctors are the same hospital. They eat lunch together almost every day; they talk, sometimes even share secrets. Each is enmeshed in a complicated, painful relationship that has technically ended but isn&#39;t really over: she is newly separated, with two small children; he&#39;s stuck in the apartment building where he grew up, where his senile mother, not to mention his ex-wife and her new family, all still live. Cecilia and Claudio are attracted to each other: magnetically, powerfully. But life has taught them to treat that attraction with suspicion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then a chance encounter between Claudio and Cecilia&#39;s sister, Silvia, shifts the precarious balance of the relationship between the two colleagues. Claudio begins to recognize the damage caused by his wary stance toward everything around him. He has hidden a hunger for life and experience beneath a veneer of apathy, a mask that also conceals a deep well of anguish. And just when Cecilia comes to the realization that she loves Claudio and is ready to commit to a genuine relationship, fate steps in once again. The complicated tale is unraveled by the son born of this love triangle, a man attempting to understand both himself and his past.&lt;br&gt;In lucid, enchanting prose, supplely rendering into English by Anne Milano Appel, Andrea Canobbio&#39;s &lt;i&gt;Three Light-Years&lt;/i&gt; sketches a fable of love poisoned by the indecision born of fear, laying bare the dangers of playing it safe when it comes to matters of the heart.&lt;/p&gt;" />
