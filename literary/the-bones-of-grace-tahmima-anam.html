  <title>The Bones of Grace - Tahmima Anam</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;From the award-winning, nationally bestselling author of &lt;em&gt;A Golden Age&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;The Good Muslim&lt;/em&gt; comes a lyrical, deeply moving modern love story about belonging, migration, tragedy, survival, and the mysteries of origins.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the eve of her departure to find the bones of the walking whale&amp;#8212;the fossil that provides a missing link in our evolution&amp;#8212;Zubaida Haque falls in love with Elijah Strong, a man she meets in a darkened concert hall in Boston. Their connection is immediate and intense, despite their differences: Elijah belongs to a prototypical American family; Zubaida is the adopted daughter of a wealthy Bangladeshi family in Dhaka. When a twist of fate sends her back to her hometown, the inevitable force of society compels her to take a very different path: she marries her childhood best friend and settles into a traditional Bangladeshi life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While her family is pleased by her obedience, Zubaida seethes with discontent. Desperate to finally free herself from her familial constraints, she moves to Chittagong to work on a documentary film about the infamous beaches where ships are destroyed, and their remains salvaged by locals who depend on the goods for their survival. Among them is Anwar, a shipbreaker whose story holds a key that will unlock the mysteries of Zubaida&amp;#8217;s past&amp;#8212;and the possibilities of a new life. As she witnesses a ship being torn down to its bones, this woman torn between the social mores of her two homes&amp;#8212;Bangladesh and America&amp;#8212;will be forced to strip away the vestiges of her own life . . . and make a choice from which she can never turn back.&lt;/p&gt;" />
