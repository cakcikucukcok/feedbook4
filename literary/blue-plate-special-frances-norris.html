  <title>Blue Plate Special - Frances Norris</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Both humorous and heartbreaking, &lt;i&gt;Blue Plate Special&lt;/i&gt; serves up an uplifting exploration of the courage it takes to embrace life after loss.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thirty-three-year-old Julia Daniel doesn&#39;t really feel at home anywhere. Her life in L.A. is lonely, and her career as a food stylist for a struggling gourmet magazine falls well short of her desire to be a photographer. Although she liked growing up in Kentucky, ever since her mother&#39;s death and her father&#39;s remarriage, her birthplace hasn&#39;t felt like the right fit either. After the tragic deaths of her father and stepmother in a plane crash, Julia&#39;s true odyssey begins. Orphaned and adrift, she tries to find her way in the world while fending off a crazy boss, a pilfering stepsister, and a looming depression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Though shored up by two good friends and an excellent psychologist who helps her work through her grief, it is an unexpected-and comically disastrous-trip to Sedona for the magazine that finally enables Julia to move forward. Returning to L.A., she searches for the strength to strike out on her own, take a chance on love, and seek a tentative peace with her wayward stepsister.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;A thoughtful look at making one&#39;s way in a world that&#39;s uncertain.&quot; - &lt;i&gt;Publishers Weekly &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />
