  <title>Often I Am Happy - Jens Christian Grøndahl</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;b&gt;This elegant and nuanced literary gem explores the intricacies of friendship, secrets, and two marriages, for fans of &lt;i&gt;The Dinner &lt;/i&gt;and &lt;i&gt;Dept. of Speculation&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; &quot;Often I am happy and yet I want to cry; / For no heart fully shares my joy.&quot; -- B.S. Ingemann&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  Ellinor is seventy. Her husband Georg has just passed away, and she is struck with the need to confide in someone. She addresses Anna, her long-dead best friend, who was also Georg&#39;s first wife. Fully aware of the absurdity of speaking to someone who cannot hear her, Ellinor nevertheless finds it meaningful to divulge long-held secrets and burdens of her past: her mother&#39;s heartbreaking pride; Ellinor&#39;s courtship with her first husband; their seemingly charmed friendship with Anna and Georg; the disastrous ski trip that shattered the two couples&#39; lives. Wry and mellow yet infused with subdued emotion, this philosophical, lyrical novel moves in parallel narrative threads while questioning the assumptions we cherish concerning identity and love." />
