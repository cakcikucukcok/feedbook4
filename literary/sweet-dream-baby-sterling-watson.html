  <title>Sweet Dream Baby - Sterling Watson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Sent to live in the humidity of rural Florida with his grandparents and his sixteen-year-old Aunt Delia for the summer, twelve-year-old Travis becomes absorbed in the closed ways of small-town life. Captivated by Delia, Travis watches her attempt to find a place for herself in the socially stunted, gossip-driven town. Delia&#39;s secrets go beyond what Travis can understand, but he believes that he alone can save her--a belief that not only forces him to grow up fast, but one that builds to a dangerous and disturbing climax. In trying to free Delia from her past, Travis leads her into a shocking present and a most uncertain future.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In a work at once honest, chilling and compulsively addictive, author Sterling Watson has created a time and place where rock &#39;n&#39; roll hums from AM radios, steam rises from a secluded riverbed and violent summer storms threaten the peace of silent nights. Watson&#39;s characters are brought vividly to life through Travis&#39;s touching, powerful and intensely personal voice. A dark and evocative coming of age tale, Sweet Dream Baby begins steeped in innocence and ends in a dramatically different place.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&quot;I can&#39;t remember a book that sneaked up and grabbed me the way Sweet Dream Baby did. It&#39;s a real shocker by a very good writer.&quot; &lt;br&gt;--Elmore Leonard &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&quot;Sterling Watson&#39;s Sweet Dream Baby is one of the finest novels I&#39;ve read in years, an incandescent blend of gothic noir, Faulknerian dreamscape and bittersweet coming-of-age story. Months after reading it, it haunts me still.&quot; &lt;br&gt;-Dennis Lehane&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&quot;Sterling Watson&#39;s Sweet Dream Baby brings us the words and music, the tastes and smells of that special time-as well as its heartache and secret shame. I was utterly absorbed in these fierce pages.&quot; &lt;br&gt;-Fred Chappell, author of Look Back All the Green Valley&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&quot;Sweet Dream Baby is a beautiful book. Sterling Watson is surehanded and telling in a story that is as elegiac as it is gripping.&quot; &lt;br&gt; -Michael Connelly, author of Chasing the Dime&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&quot;Some delicious page-turning.&quot;-Kirkus Reviews&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A Book Sense 76 Top 10 Selection&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Named to Top Ten Crime Books of 2002, Toronto Globe and Mail&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&quot;Watson proves himself a first-rate storyteller.&quot;-Publishers Weekly&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&quot;A comprehensive work of art that is as thought-provoking as it is disturbing.&quot;-Orlando SentinelSent to live in the humidity of rural Florida with his grandparents and his sixteen-year-old Aunt Delia for the summer, twelve-year-old Travis becomes absorbed in the closed ways of small-town life.
