  <title>Claiming Colleen (Mills &amp; Boon Cherish) (Home to Harbor Town, Book 2) - Beth Kery</title>
      <meta name="description" content="
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;From Forbidden Crush… to Forever Love?&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Former small-town princess Colleen used to have it all and Eric was the outsider with his nose pressed against the glass. Then a sudden change in circumstance led to a reversal of fortune. Now Eric was a wealthy, successful, arrogant surgeon who rubbed the one-time golden girl the wrong way.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;When fate forces Eric and Colleen back together, the single mum finds herself drawn to the irresistible doctor despite their dark history. She’d felt something for Eric when they were teenagers, but those memories were long forgotten – or so she thought.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;It wasn’t long before he wooed her into his arms. But could their newfound passion lead to the happily-ever-after of their dreams?&lt;/p&gt;
