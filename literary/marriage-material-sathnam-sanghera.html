  <title>Marriage Material - Sathnam Sanghera</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Sathnam Sanghera&#39;s debut novel is a luminous exploration of the life of an immigrant family in the UK, layering the contemporary story of a young man caught between British and Punjabi culture, the history of his family, and the new life he&#39;s made for himself. In a fresh narrative voice that wryly observes, questions, and reflects, Sanghera confronts the complexities of tradition, culture, love, and family. Readers will find more laughter than sadness, smiling even when the Banga family&#39;s story seems hopeless.&amp;#160;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In an ordinary town in the West Midlands, Arjan Banga reluctantly becomes the new proprietor of the family convenience store after the sudden death of his father. Grimly reevaluating his life as he struggles to protect the store as well as escape it, Arjan gains a grudging appreciation of the family generations that came before him-of their courage and weakness, sacrifices, and follies. As Arjan begins to spend more time than he intended with the store, watching his London life and English fianc&amp;eacute;e&amp;#160;slip away, he will have to explore the past in order to step into the future." />
