  <title>A Project Chick - Nikki Turner</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Tressa is a fly girl accustomed to the lavish lifestyle that her possessive, deranged, baby&#39;s daddy, Lucky, has provider her with. In order to keep her high post standards of living, she has excused so many of his unforgivable actions. It is not until he pulls off the ultimate stunt that she realizes that no mink coat, car, house or any amount of money is worth her peace of mind. Never blinking or thinking twice, Tressa leaves everything behind, with the exception of her street savvy, and sets out to make a life of her own, one that would be filled with hard times and even harder luck. Tressa soon finds herself making the transition from public figure to public assistance. Every day of her life seems like one drama-filled chapter after another. From the baby daddy drama, to the backstabbing friends, to the various unforgettable men she sorts through and disposes of. There will be times she has to struggle and scramble just to make ends meet, and other times when she will stand tall and hold her own. In this captivating tale, Tressa&#39;s voyage will expose readers to a side of a struggling single mother that has yet to be revealed to them Nikki Turner, the best selling author of A Hustler&#39;s Wife, once again will take readers on a safari through the jungle of the fierce and stormy streets, leaving readers on the edge of their seats begging for an encore." />
