        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;Nine people have gathered for the reading of Aurore Gerritsen&#39;s will. Some are family, others are strangers. But all will have their futures changed forever when a lifetime of secrets is finally revealed.&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Aurore Gerritsen left clear instructions: her will is to be read over a four-day period at her summer cottage on a small Louisiana island. Those who don&#39;t stay will forfeit their inheritance. With the vast fortune of Gulf Coast Shipping at stake, no one will take that risk.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Tensions rise as Aurore&#39;s lawyer dispenses small bequests, each designed to expose the matriarch&#39;s well-kept secrets. Longtime loyalties are jeopardized and shocking new alliances are formed as the family feels the sands of belief shifting beneath their feet. As a hurricane approaches and survival itself is threatened, the fourth day dawns and everyone waits for the final truth to be revealed.&lt;/p&gt;

Louisiana is ruled by hurricanes, and so are my novels Iron Lace and Rising Tides. While Iron Lace begins with the tragic hurricane of 1893, Rising Tides ends with Hurricane Betsy, 1965.. Having grown up on the Gulf Coast of Florida, I come by my interest in hurricanes honestly, but my only Louisiana hurricane story is funny, unlike the ones in these two novels, or in real life ...<br /><b><i>Rising Tides - Emilie Richards</i></b> | 5.0 out of 5 stars Rising Tides By Emilie Richards. Reviewed in the United Kingdom on February 12, 2013. Verified Purchase. Looking forward to reading this sequel to Iron Lace wonderful relaxation. M/s Richards chose such an imaginative and controversial storyline. Read more.
