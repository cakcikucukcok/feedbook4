  <title>On a Dark Night I Left My Silent House - Peter Handke, Krishna Winston</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;On a Dark Night I Left My Silent House&lt;/i&gt; is Nobel Prize winner Peter Handke&#39;s evocative, moving, often fantastic, short novel about one man&#39;s conflict with himself and his journey toward resolution.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;During one night shift, an unnamed, middle-aged pharmacist in Taxham, an isolated suburb of Salzburg, tells his story to a narrator. The pharmacist is known and well-respected, but lonely and estranged from his wife. He feels most comfortable wandering about in nature, collecting and eating hallucinogenic mushrooms. One day he receives a blow to the head that leaves him unable to speak, and the narrative is transformed from ironic description into a collection of sensual impressions, observations and reflections. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The pharmacist, who is now called the driver, sets out on a quest, travelling into the Alps with two companions--a former Olympic skiing champion and a formerly famous poet--where he is beaten and later stalked by a woman. He drives through a tunnel and has a premonition of death, then finds himself in a surreal, foreign land. In a final series of bizarre, cathartic events, the driver regains his speech and is taken back to his pharmacy--back to his former life, but forever changed. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A powerful, poetic exploration of language, longing and dislocation in the human experience, &lt;i&gt;On a Dark Night I Left My Silent House&lt;/i&gt; reveals Handke at his magical best.&lt;/p&gt;" />
