  <title>The Story Hour - Thrity Umrigar</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;From the critically beloved, bestselling author of &lt;em&gt;The World We Found&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;The Space Between U&lt;/em&gt;s, whom the &lt;em&gt;New York Times Book Review&lt;/em&gt; calls a &amp;#8220;perceptive and... piercing writer,&amp;#8221; comes a profound, heartbreakingly honest novel about friendship, family, secrets, forgiveness, and second chances.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An experienced psychologist, Maggie carefully maintains emotional distance from her patients. But when she meets a young Indian woman who tried to kill herself, her professional detachment disintegrates. Cut off from her family in India, Lakshmi is desperately lonely and trapped in a loveless marriage to a domineering man who limits her world to their small restaurant and grocery store.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Moved by her plight, Maggie treats Lakshmi in her home office for free, quickly realizing that the despondent woman doesn&amp;#8217;t need a shrink; she needs a friend. Determined to empower Lakshmi as a woman who feels valued in her own right, Maggie abandons protocol, and soon doctor and patient have become close friends.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But while their relationship is deeply affectionate, it is also warped by conflicting expectations. When Maggie and Lakshmi open up and share long-buried secrets, the revelations will jeopardize their close bond, shake their faith in each other, and force them to confront painful choices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />
