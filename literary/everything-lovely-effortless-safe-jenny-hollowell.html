  <title>Everything Lovely, Effortless, Safe - Jenny Hollowell</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;A young woman caught at the turning point between success and failure hopes fame and fortune will finally let her leave her old life--and her old self--behind&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Birdie Baker has always dreamed of becoming someone else. At twenty-two, she sets off to do just that. Walking out on her pastor husband and deeply evangelical parents, she leaves behind her small-town, small-time life and gets on a bus to Los Angeles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nine years later, Birdie&#39;s life in Hollywood is far from golden, and nothing in the intervening years--the brutal auditions, the tawdry commercials--has brought her any closer to the transformation she craves. Caught between success and failure, haunted by guilt about a tragedy in her long-forsaken family, Birdie is at the brink of collapse when she meets Lewis, a beautiful but naïve young actor with his own troubled history, whose self-destructive impulses run dangerously parallel to her own.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When her big chance finally comes, Birdie must reconcile the wide-eyed girl she once was with the jaded starlet she has become and try to find herself and her future somewhere in between. &lt;i&gt;Everything Lovely, Effortless, Safe&lt;/i&gt; is the story of a young woman&#39;s struggle to make her own way in the Technicolor land of make-believe.&lt;/p&gt;" />
