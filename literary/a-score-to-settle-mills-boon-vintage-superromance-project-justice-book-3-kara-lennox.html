  <title>A Score to Settle (Mills &amp; Boon Vintage Superromance) (Project Justice, Book 3) - Kara Lennox</title>
      <meta name="description" content="
        &lt;p&gt;Daniel Logan spent six years on death row for a crime he didn&#39;t commit. So for him, the justice system is…&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;flawed. Since his release, he&#39;s dedicated himself to helping others wrongly convicted. Now his latest crusade pits him against star prosecutor Jamie McNair. Her staunch belief in this system makes freeing a man she put away seem insurmountable. Exactly the kind of challenge Daniel thrives on.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Digging into the case reveals disturbing similarities to his own arrest and conviction. Could the same murderer be at work? To his surprise he relies on Jamie to help free an innocent man and help Daniel escape his past. As they get closer to the truth, their attraction brings them together. Only, the stakes are higher than either realizes….&lt;/p&gt;
