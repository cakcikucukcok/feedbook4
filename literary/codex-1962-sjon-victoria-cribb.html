  <title>CoDex 1962 - Sjon, Victoria Cribb</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Spanning eras, continents, and genres, &lt;i&gt;CoDex 1962&lt;/i&gt;--twenty years in the making--is Sjón&#39;s epic three-part masterpiece&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over the course of four dazzling novels translated into dozens of languages, Sjón has earned a global reputation as one of the world&#39;s most interesting writers. But what the world has never been able to read is his great trilogy of novels, known collectively as &lt;i&gt;CoDex 1962&lt;/i&gt;--now finally complete.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Josef Löwe, the narrator, was born in 1962--the same year, the same moment even, as Sjón. Josef&#39;s story, however, stretches back decades in the form of Leo Löwe--a Jewish fugitive during World War II who has an affair with a maid in a German inn; together, they form a baby from a piece of clay. If the first volume is a love story, the second is a crime story: Löwe arrives in Iceland with the clay-baby inside a hatbox, only to be embroiled in a murder mystery--but by the end of the volume, his clay son has come to life. And in the final volume, set in present-day Reykjavík, Josef&#39;s story becomes science fiction as he crosses paths with the outlandish CEO of a biotech company (based closely on reality) who brings the story of genetics and genesis full circle. But the future, according to Sjón, is not so dark as it seems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In &lt;i&gt;CoDex 1962&lt;/i&gt;, Sjón has woven ancient and modern material and folklore and cosmic myths into a singular masterpiece--encompassing genre fiction, theology, expressionist film, comic strips, fortean studies, genetics, and, of course, the rich tradition of Icelandic storytelling.&lt;/p&gt;" />
