  <title>Thanksgiving Night - Richard Bausch</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Will Butterfield can&#39;t believe it. His 75&amp;ndash;year&amp;ndash;old mother, Holly, is drunk and threatening to jump off the roof. Again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Holly and Fiona, another elderly relative, won&#39;t stop tormenting Will and his wife Elizabeth with their bizarre (though often amusing) antics. Between Will&#39;s worries about his bookstore, The Heart&#39;s Ease, and Elizabeth&#39;s troublesome high school students, dealing with &quot;the crazies&quot; has become just too much.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But then something unexpected happens &amp;ndash;&amp;ndash; Henry Ward, a neighborhood handyman, meets the two old women, and he, his daughter Alison, and grandchildren are drawn into the Butterfields&#39; lives in surprising ways. Both a comedy and a love story &amp;ndash;&amp;ndash; a first for Bausch &amp;ndash;&amp;ndash; Thanksgiving Night is about the real meaning of family, and one particular clan that has many reasons to be thankful.&lt;/p&gt;" />
