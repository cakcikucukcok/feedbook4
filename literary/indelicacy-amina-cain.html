  <title>Indelicacy - Amina Cain</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&quot;&lt;i&gt;Indelicacy&lt;/i&gt; isn&#39;t merely a book, it&#39;s a world; a world I wanted to live in, forever . . . Arch, yet warm; aspiring and impervious; confiding and enigmatic; reposing and intrepid; Cain has conjured a protagonist who purged my mind and filled my heart.&quot; &lt;/b&gt;--&lt;b&gt;Claire-Louise Bennett, author of &lt;i&gt;Pond&lt;/i&gt;  &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;A haunted feminist fable, Amina Cain&#39;s &lt;i&gt;Indelicacy&lt;/i&gt; is the story of a woman navigating between gender and class roles to empower herself and fulfill her dreams.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In &quot;a strangely ageless world somewhere between Emily Dickinson and David Lynch&quot; (Blake Butler), a cleaning woman at a museum of art nurtures aspirations to do more than simply dust the paintings around her. She dreams of having the liberty to explore them in writing, and so must find a way to win herself the time and security to use her mind. She escapes her lot by marrying a rich man, but having gained a husband, a house, high society, and a maid, she finds that her new life of privilege is no less constrained. Not only has she taken up different forms of time-consuming labor--social and erotic--but she is now, however passively, forcing other women to clean up after &lt;i&gt;her&lt;/i&gt;. Perhaps another and more drastic solution is necessary?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Reminiscent of a lost Victorian classic in miniature, yet taking equal inspiration from such modern authors as Jean Rhys, Octavia Butler, Clarice Lispector, and Jean Genet, Amina Cain&#39;s &lt;i&gt;Indelicacy&lt;/i&gt; is at once a ghost story without a ghost, a fable without a moral, and a down-to-earth investigation of the barriers faced by women in both life and literature. It is a novel about seeing, class, desire, anxiety, pleasure, friendship, and the battle to find one&#39;s true calling.&lt;/p&gt;" />
