  <title>The Book Against God - James Wood</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;A Passionate, Profoundly Funny First Novel from &quot;the Best Literary Critic of His Generation&quot; (Adam Begley, &lt;i&gt;Financial Times&lt;/i&gt;)&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thomas Bunting, the charming, chaotic, and deeply untruthful narrator of James Wood&#39;s wonderful first novel, is in despair. His marriage is disintegrating and his academic career is in ruins: instead of completing his philosophy Ph.D. (still unfinished after seven years), he is secretly writing what he hopes will be his masterwork, a vast atheistic project he has privately entitled &quot;The Book Against God.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But when his father suddenly falls ill, Thomas returns to the tiny village in the north of England where he grew up and where his father still works as a parish priest. There, Thomas hopes, he may finally be able to communicate honestly with his father, a brilliant and formidable Christian example, and sort out his own wayward life. But Thomas is a chronic liar as well as an atheist, and he finds, instead, that once at home he soon reverts to the evasive patterns of his childhood years--with disastrous results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story of a husband and wife, a father and son, faith and disbelief, and a hero who couldn&#39;t tell the truth if his life depended on it, &lt;i&gt;The Book Against God&lt;/i&gt; is at once hilarious and poignant; it introduces an original comic voice--edgy, elegiac, lyrical, and indignant--and, in the irrepressible Thomas Bunting, one of the strangest philosophers in contemporary fiction.&lt;/p&gt;" />
