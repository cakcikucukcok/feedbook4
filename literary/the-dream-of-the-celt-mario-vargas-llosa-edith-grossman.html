  <title>The Dream of the Celt - Mario Vargas Llosa, Edith Grossman</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;A subtle and enlightening novel about a neglected human rights pioneer by the Nobel Laureate Mario Vargas Llosa&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 1916, the Irish nationalist Roger Casement was hanged by the British government for treason. Casement had dedicated his extraordinary life to improving the plight of oppressed peoples around the world--especially the native populations in the Belgian Congo and the Amazon--but when he dared to draw a parallel between the injustices he witnessed in African and American colonies and those committed by the British in Northern Ireland, he became involved in a cause that led to his imprisonment and execution. Ultimately, the scandals surrounding Casement&#39;s trial and eventual hanging tainted his image to such a degree that his pioneering human rights work wasn&#39;t fully reexamined until the 1960s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In &lt;i&gt;The Dream of the Celt&lt;/i&gt;, Mario Vargas Llosa, who has long been regarded as one of Latin America&#39;s most vibrant, provocative, and necessary literary voices--a fact confirmed when he was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature in 2010--brings this complex character to life as no other writer can. A masterful work, sharply translated by Edith Grossman, &lt;i&gt;The Dream of the Celt &lt;/i&gt;tackles a controversial man whose story has long been neglected, and, in so doing, pushes at the boundaries of the historical novel.&lt;/p&gt;" />
