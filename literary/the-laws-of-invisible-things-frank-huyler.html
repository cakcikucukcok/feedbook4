  <title>The Laws of Invisible Things - Frank Huyler</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;In this suspenseful and finely wrought first novel, a young doctor&#39;s encounter with a mysterious disease leads him to a crossroads between faith and reason&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Not long into Michael Grant&#39;s first year in his new practice, a young girl in his care unexpectedly dies. He might not have been able to change that outcome, but he didn&#39;t do all in his power to prevent it, either. So when Michael is asked to take on the dead girl&#39;s father as a patient, he feels he must oblige the family&#39;s wishes. Examining the man, Michael notices an unusual pattern--a white, serpentine spiral--on the back of the throat and in his eye. But before a diagnosis can be made, the man is dead, the victim of a mysterious fire, and soon Michael himself is experiencing symptoms of the strange illness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Believing that he has stumbled across a new disease but unable to convince his skeptical colleagues, Michael sets out to gather evidence. His quest takes him into a wilderness of disease, religion, and mystery, and becomes a journey that leads him to question not only his belief in the order of the world but his own place and purpose within it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lyrical, poetic, and utterly engrossing, &lt;i&gt;The Laws of Invisible Things&lt;/i&gt; fully delivers on the promise of Frank Huyler&#39;s critically acclaimed collection of medical stories, &lt;i&gt;The Blood of Strangers&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;" />
