  <title>Upstate - James Wood</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;New Yorker&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt; book critic and award-winning author James Wood delivers a novel of a family struggling to connect with one another and find meaning in their own lives. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the years since his daughter Vanessa moved to America to become a professor of philosophy, Alan Querry has never been to visit. He has been too busy at home in northern England, holding together his business as a successful property developer. His younger daughter, Helen--a music executive in London--hasn&#39;t gone, either, and the two sisters, close but competitive, have never quite recovered from their parents&#39; bitter divorce and the early death of their mother. But when Vanessa&#39;s new boyfriend sends word that she has fallen into a severe depression and that he&#39;s worried for her safety, Alan and Helen fly to New York and take the train to Saratoga Springs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over the course of six wintry days in upstate New York, the Querry family begins to struggle with the questions that animate this profound and searching novel: Why do some people find living so much harder than others? Is happiness a skill that might be learned or a cruel accident of birth? Is reflection conducive to happiness or an obstacle to it? If, as a favorite philosopher of Helen&#39;s puts it, &quot;the only serious enterprise is living,&quot; how should we live? Rich in subtle human insight, full of poignant and often funny portraits, and vivid with a sense of place, James Wood&#39;s &lt;i&gt;Upstate &lt;/i&gt;is a powerful, intense, beautiful novel.&lt;/p&gt;" />
