  <title>When All Is Said - Anne Griffin</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;THE INTERNATIONAL BESTSELLER &amp; INDIE NEXT PICK&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&quot;Griffin&#39;s stunning debut, brimming with irresistible Irish-isms, is an elegy to love, loss and the complexity of life.&quot; &lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;-People Magazine&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;One of Goodreads&#39; 43 Most Anticipated Reads of 2019&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&quot;Beautiful. Intimate. Tearful. Aching and lyrical. So simply and beautifully told.&quot; -Louise Penny, #1 &lt;/i&gt;New York Times&lt;i&gt; bestselling author&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&quot;I&#39;m here to remember-all that I have been and all that I will never be again.&quot;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;If you had to pick five people to sum up your life, who would they be? If you were to raise a glass to each of them, what would you say? And what would you learn about yourself, when all is said? &lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;At the bar of a grand hotel in a small Irish town sits 84-year-old Maurice Hannigan. He&#39;s alone, as usual ­- though tonight is anything but. Pull up a stool and charge your glass, because Maurice is finally ready to tell his story.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Over the course of this evening, he will raise five toasts to the five people who have meant the most to him. Through these stories - of unspoken joy and regret, a secret tragedy kept hidden, a fierce love that never found its voice - the life of one man will be powerful and poignantly laid bare.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Beautifully heart-warming and powerfully felt, the voice of Maurice Hannigan will stay with you long after all is said and done.&lt;/p&gt;" />
