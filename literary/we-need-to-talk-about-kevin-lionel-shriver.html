  <title>We Need to Talk About Kevin - Lionel Shriver</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;That neither nature nor nurture bears exclusive responsibility for a child&#39;s character is self-evident. But generalizations about genes are likely to provide cold comfort if it&#39;s your own child who just opened fire on his feellow algebra students and whose class photograph&amp;#151;with its unseemly grin&amp;#151;is shown on the evening news coast-to-coast.&lt;br&gt;&lt;BR&gt;If the question of who&#39;s to blame for teenage atrocity intrigues news-watching voyeurs, it tortures our narrator, Eva Khatchadourian.  Two years before the opening of the novel, her son, Kevin, murdered seven of his fellow high school students, a cafeteria worker, and the much-beloved teacher who had tried to befriend him. Because his sixteenth birthday arrived two days after the killings, he received a lenient sentence and is currently in a prison for young offenders in upstate New York.&lt;br&gt;&lt;BR&gt;In relating the story of Kevin&#39;s upbringing, Eva addresses her estranged husband, Frank, through a series of startingly direct letters. Fearing that her own shortcomings may have shaped what her son became, she confesses to a deep, long-standing ambivalence about both motherhood in general&amp;#151;and Kevin in particular. How much is her fault?&lt;br&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;I&gt;We Need To Talk About Kevin&lt;/I&gt; offers no at explanations for why so many white, well-to-do adolescents&amp;#151;whether in Pearl, Paducah, Springfield, or Littleton&amp;#151;have gone nihilistically off the rails while growing up in the most prosperous country in history. Instead, Lionel Shriver tells a compelling, absorbing, and resonant story with an explosive, haunting ending. She considers motherhood, marriage, family, career&amp;#151;while framing these horrifying tableaus of teenage carnage as metaphors for the larger tragedy of a country where everything works, nobody starves, and anything can be bought but a sense of purpose.&lt;/div&gt;" />
