  <title>Banishing Verona - Margot Livesey</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;A couple begins an intense affair, only to be separated abruptly-and perhaps irrevocably-in this surprising, suspenseful love story&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Zeke is twenty-nine, a man who looks like a Raphael angel and who earns his living as a painter and carpenter in London. He reads the world a little differently from most people and has trouble with such ordinary activities as lying, deciphering expressions, recognizing faces. Verona is thirty-seven, confident, hot-tempered, a modestly successful radio show host, unmarried, and seven months pregnant. When the two meet in a house that Zeke is renovating, they fall in love, only to be separated less than twenty-four hours later when Verona leaves abruptly, without explanation, for Boston. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both Zeke and Verona, it turns out, have complications in their lives, though not of a romantic kind. Verona&#39;s involve her brother, Henry, who is tied up in shady financial dealings. Zeke&#39;s father has had a heart attack and his mother is threatening to run away with her lover, all of which puts pressure on Zeke to take over the family grocery business. And yet he finds himself following Verona to Boston. As he pursues her, and she pursues Henry, both are forced to ask the perplexing question: Can we ever know another person?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Deftly plotted and filled with unexpected twists, Livesey&#39;s &lt;i&gt;Banishing Verona&lt;/i&gt; marks the arrival of another lyrical and wise novel from a writer whose work &quot;radiates with compassion and intelligence and always, deliciously, mystery&quot; (Alice Sebold).&lt;/p&gt;" />
