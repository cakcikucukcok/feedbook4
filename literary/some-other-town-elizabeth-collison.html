  <title>Some Other Town - Elizabeth Collison</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Channeling the emotional intensity of Susan Minot and Amy Bloom&amp;#8212;and infused with a witty, dream-like surrealism reminiscent of Margaret Atwood&amp;#8212;this mesmerizing debut takes us inside the unsettling world of Margaret Lydia Benning, which turns upside down when she falls in love&amp;#8230;and then unravels before our eyes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;What I have to tell Ben is just this. At last I am certain. All the signs, all the dreams are in. And I know now I have made a terrible mistake. I was wrong, it turns out, about us.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Margaret Lydia Benning lives adrift in the same Midwest town where she went to college. By day, she works at a low-level job for the Project, a university-sponsored educational publisher housed in a former sanatorium. There she shares the fourth floor with a squadron of eccentric editors and a resident ghost from the screamers&amp;#8217; wing. At night, Margaret returns to her small house on Mott Street, resigned to the disturbing overtures of her strange neighbor, Mrs. Eberline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Emotionally sleepwalking through the days is no way to lead a life. But then Margaret meets Ben Adams, a visiting professor of art at the university. Despite the odds&amp;#8212;and their best intentions&amp;#8212;Margaret and her professor become lovers, and she glimpses a future she had never before imagined. For the first time, she has hope&amp;#8230;until Ben inexplicably vanishes. In the wake of his disappearance, Margaret sets out to find him. Her journey will force her to question everything she believes to be true.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Told through intertwined perspectives, by turns incandescent and haunting,&lt;em&gt; Some Other Town&lt;/em&gt; is an unforgettable tale, with a heart-breaking twist, of one woman&amp;#8217;s awakening to her own possibility&amp;#8212;and her ability to love, and love well.&lt;/p&gt;" />
