      <meta name="description" content="Jackie is a young, ambitious, Barbadian girl from a poor community struggling to get out of her loveless, abusive environment. She has her academic and professional life laid out in a mental blueprint, and it shows that she is destined for considerable success. However, as she is poised to move on to a better life, her mother does the unthinkable and creates a situation that makes Jackie&#39;s world spiral completely out of control.  It places her in a helpless position that this strong, independent girl never thought imaginable. The young girl endures the most horrific experience anyone could ever imagine. Only it isn&#39;t a dream...it&#39;s a nightmare, the kind she never expected could happen to her family." />
