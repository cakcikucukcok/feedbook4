  <title>The Billionaire Gets His Way / The Sarantos Secret Baby: The Billionaire Gets His Way / The Sarantos Secret Baby (Mills &amp; Boon Desire) - Elizabeth Bevarly, Olivia Gates</title>
      <meta name="description" content="
        &lt;p&gt;THE BILLIONAIRE GETS HIS WAY&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;He&#39;d carved out his empire with hard work and steely determination. But now billionaire Gavin Mason&#39;s reputation was in question. All because he resembled a character in Violet Tandy&#39;s bestselling novel. Since he&#39;d never even met the woman, she had some serious explaining to do. Seemingly innocent Violet claimed her work was pure fiction, but no one in Gavin&#39;s elite social circle was buying it. The infuriating beauty owed him big-time, and he found great pleasure in making her pretend to be his girlfriend. Still, Gavin wondered if having her this close would destroy his most prized status — that of confirmed bachelor.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;THE SARANTOS SECRET BABY&lt;br /&gt;He was as tall and dark as the devil… and was her family&#39;s hated adversary. But that didn&#39;t stop Selene Louvardis from wanting Aris Sarantos with her every breath. Or grabbing her one chance for a forbidden night with him. He was never supposed to learn she&#39;d borne his child. But when Aris stormed back into Selene&#39;s life and discovered the truth, nothing would stop the ruthless billionaire from claiming his own. Not her family, not the billion-dollar contract at stake and certainly not something as inconvenient as love.&lt;/p&gt;
