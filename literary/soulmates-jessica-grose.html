  <title>Soulmates - Jessica Grose</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&quot;For anyone who has ever suspected something sinister lurking behind the craze of new-age spirituality, Jessica Grose has crafted just the tale for you. With the delicious bite of satire and the page-turning satisfaction of a thriller, &lt;em&gt;Soulmates&lt;/em&gt; is a deeply compelling, funny and sharply observed look at just how far we will go to achieve inner peace.&quot;&amp;#8212;Lena Dunham&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A clever, timely novel about a marriage, and infidelity, the meaning of true spirituality, perception and reality from the author of &lt;em&gt;Sad Desk Salad&lt;/em&gt;, in which a scorned ex-wife tries to puzzle out the pieces of her husband&amp;#8217;s mysterious death at a yoga retreat and their life together.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s been two years since the divorce, and Dana has moved on. She&amp;#8217;s killing it at her law firm, she&amp;#8217;s never looked better, thanks to all those healthy meals she cooks, and she&amp;#8217;s thrown away Ethan&amp;#8217;s ratty old plaid recliner. She hardly thinks about her husband&amp;#8212;ex-husband&amp;#8212;anymore, or about how the man she&amp;#8217;d known since college ran away to the Southwest with a yoga instructor, spouting spiritual claptrap that Dana still can&amp;#8217;t comprehend. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But when she sees Ethan&amp;#8217;s picture splashed across the front page of the &lt;em&gt;New York Post&lt;/em&gt;&amp;#8212;&quot;Nama-Slay: Yoga Couple Found Dead in New Mexico Cave&quot;&amp;#8212;Dana discovers she hasn&amp;#8217;t fully let go of Ethan or the past. The article implies that it was a murder-suicide, and Ethan&amp;#8217;s to blame. How could the man she once loved so deeply be a killer? Restless to find answers that might help her finally to let go, Dana begins to dig into the mystery surrounding Ethan&amp;#8217;s death. Sifting through the clues of his life, Dana finds herself back in the last years of their marriage . . . and discovers that their relationship&amp;#8212;like Ethan&amp;#8217;s death&amp;#8212;wasn&amp;#8217;t what it appeared to be.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A novel of marriage, meditation, and all the spaces in between, &lt;em&gt;Soulmates&lt;/em&gt; is a page-turning mystery, a delicious satire of our feel-good spiritual culture, and a nuanced look at contemporary relationships by one of the sharpest writers working today.&lt;/p&gt;" />
