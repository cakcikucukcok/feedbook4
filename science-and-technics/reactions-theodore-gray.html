  <title>Reactions - Theodore Gray</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;&lt;b&gt;The third book in Theodore Gray&#39;s bestselling Elements Trilogy, &lt;i&gt;Reactions &lt;/i&gt;continues the journey through the world of chemistry that began with his two previous bestselling books &lt;i&gt;The Elements&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Molecules&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;div&gt;With &lt;i&gt;The Elements,&lt;/i&gt; Gray gave us a never-before-seen, mesmerizing photographic view of the 118 elements in the periodic table. In &lt;i&gt;Molecules&lt;/i&gt;, he showed us how the elements combine to form the content that makes up our universe. With &lt;i&gt;Reactions &lt;/i&gt;Gray once again puts his one-of-a-kind photography and storytelling ability to work demonstrating how molecules interact in ways that are essential to our very existence. The book begins with a brief recap of elements and molecules and then goes on to explain important concepts the characterize a chemical reaction, including Energy, Entropy, and Time. It is then organized by type of reaction including chapters such as &quot;Fantastic Reactions and Where to Find Them,&quot; &quot;On the Origin of Light and Color,&quot; &quot;The Boring Chapter,&quot; in which we learn about reactions such as paint drying, grass growing, and water boiling, and &quot;The Need for Speed,&quot; including topics such as weather, ignition, and fire.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;" />
