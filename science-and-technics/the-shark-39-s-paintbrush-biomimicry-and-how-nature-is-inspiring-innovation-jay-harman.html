  <title>The Shark&#39;s Paintbrush: Biomimicry and How Nature is Inspiring Innovation - Jay Harman</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;Why does the bumblebee have better aerodynamics than a 747? What structural design is shared by a tornado and a blood vessel?&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Since the Industrial Revolution, manufacturers have built things by a process known as &amp;#147;heat, beat, and treat.&amp;#8221; They use enormous amounts of energy to heat raw material, shape it with heavy machinery, and maintain its design, strength, and durability with toxic chemicals. Now, in a world of depleted natural resources, entrepreneurs and scientists are turning to nature to inspire future products that are more energy- and cost-efficient. Biomimicry, the science of employing nature to advance sustainable technology, is arguably one of the hottest new business concepts. At the center of this growing movement has been award-winning inventor and biomimetic entrepreneur Jay Harman.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;In &lt;I&gt;The Shark&#39;s Paintbrush,&lt;/I&gt; Harman introduces us to pioneering engineers in a wide array of businesses who are uncovering and copying nature&amp;#8217;s hidden marvels. He shows business leaders and aspiring entrepreneurs how we can reconcile creating more powerful, lucrative technologies with maximizing sustainability. He injects a whole new vocabulary and way of thinking into the business sphere that speaks to both small start-ups and corporate giants.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/div&gt;" />
