  <title>Newton&#39;s Principia - Isaac Newton, Andrew Motte (Translator)</title>
      <meta name="description" content="NEWTON&amp;#39;S PRINCIPIA : Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy, often referred to as simply the Principia, is a work in three books by Isaac Newton, in Latin, first published 5 July 1687. The Principia states Newton&amp;#39;s laws of motion, forming the foundation of classical mechanics; Newton&amp;#39;s law of universal gravitation; and a derivation of Kepler&amp;#39;s laws of planetary motion (which Kepler first obtained empirically). The Principia is &amp;quot;justly regarded as one of the most important works in the history of science&amp;quot;.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Alexis Clairaut assessed it in 1747: &amp;quot;The famous book of mathematical Principles of natural Philosophy marked the epoch of a great revolution in physics. The method followed by its illustrious author Sir Newton ... spread the light of mathematics on a science which up to then had remained in the darkness of conjectures and hypotheses.&amp;quot; A more recent assessment has been that while acceptance of Newton&amp;#39;s theories was not immediate, by the end of a century after publication, &amp;quot;no one could deny that&amp;quot; (out of the Principia) &amp;quot;a science had emerged that, at least in certain respects, so far exceeded anything that had ever gone before that it stood alone as the ultimate exemplar of science generally.&amp;quot;" />
