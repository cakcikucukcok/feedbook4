  <title>Tales from Both Sides of the Brain - Michael S. Gazzaniga</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Michael S. Gazzaniga, one of the most important neuroscientists of the twentieth century, gives us an exciting behind-the-scenes look at his seminal work on that unlikely couple, the right and left brain. Foreword by Steven Pinker.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the mid-twentieth century, Michael S. Gazzaniga, &amp;#8220;the father of cognitive neuroscience,&amp;#8221; was part of a team of pioneering neuroscientists who developed the now foundational split-brain brain theory: the notion that the right and left hemispheres of the brain can act independently from one another and have different strengths.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In &lt;em&gt;Tales from Both Sides of the Brain&lt;/em&gt;, Gazzaniga tells the impassioned story of his life in science and his decades-long journey to understand how the separate spheres of our brains communicate and miscommunicate with their separate agendas. By turns humorous and moving, &lt;em&gt;Tales from Both Sides of the Brain&lt;/em&gt; interweaves Gazzaniga&amp;#8217;s scientific achievements with his reflections on the challenges and thrills of working as a scientist. In his engaging and accessible style, he paints a vivid portrait not only of his discovery of split-brain theory, but also of his comrades in arms&amp;#8212;the many patients, friends, and family who have accompanied him on this wild ride of intellectual discovery.&lt;/p&gt;" />
