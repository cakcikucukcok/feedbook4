  <title>Steward of the Land: Selected Writings of Nineteenth-Century Horticulturist Thomas Affleck - Thomas Affleck, Lake Douglas</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;In the first collection of published writings of Thomas Affleck (1812--1868), Lake Douglas re-establishes the reputation of a tireless agricultural reformer, entrepreneur, and horticulturist. Affleck&#39;s wide range of interests -- animal husbandry, agriculture, scientific farming, ornamental horticulture, insects, and hydrology, among others -- should afford him a celebrated status in several disciplines; yet until now his immense contributions remained largely unheralded. Steward of the Land remedies this oversight with a broad, annotated selection of Affleck&#39;s works, rightfully placing him alongside his better-known contemporaries Andrew Jackson Downing and Frederick Law Olmsted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After immigrating to the United States from Scotland in 1832, Affleck witnessed the burgeoning American expansion and its major advances in agriculture and technology. He worked as a journalist for the influential Western Farmer and Gardener, covering Ohio, Kentucky, and the Mississippi River Valley. Affleck moved to Mississippi in 1842 to manage his new wife&#39;s failing plantation; there, he created one of the first commercial nurseries of the South while writing prolifically on numerous agrarian topics for regional periodicals and newspapers. From 1845 to 1865 he edited Affleck&#39;s Southern Rural Almanac and Plantation and Garden Calendar, published in New Orleans. Following a postwar move to Brenham, Texas, he published letters and essays about rebuilding that state&#39;s livestock herds and rejuvenating its agricultural labor forces.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Steward of the Land includes excerpts from dozens of Affleck&#39;s articles on subjects ranging from bee keeping to gardening to orchard tending. This valuable single-volume resource reveals Affleck&#39;s astonishing breadth of horticultural knowledge and entrepreneurial sagacity, and his role in educating mid-nineteenth-century readers about agricultural products and practices, plant usage, and environmental stewardship. Never before collected or contextualized, Affleck&#39;s writings provide a firsthand account of the advancement of agricultural techniques and practices that created a new environmental awareness in America.&lt;/p&gt;" />
