  <title>What Is Life? - Ed Regis</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;In 1944, the Nobel Prize-winning physicist Erwin Schrödinger published a groundbreaking little book called &lt;i&gt;What Is Life? &lt;/i&gt;In fewer than one hundred pages, he argued that life was not a mysterious or inexplicable phenomenon, as many people believed, but a scientific process like any other, ultimately explainable by the laws of physics and chemistry. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today, more than sixty years later, members of a new generation of scientists are attempting to create life from the ground up. Science has moved forward in leaps and bounds since Schrödinger&#39;s time, but our understanding of what does and does not constitute life has only grown more complex. An era that has already seen computer chip-implanted human brains, genetically engineered organisms, genetically modified foods, cloned mammals, and brain-dead humans kept &quot;alive&quot; by machines is one that demands fresh thinking about the concept of life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While a segment of our national debate remains stubbornly mired in moral quandaries over abortion, euthanasia, and other &quot;right to life&quot; issues, the science writer Ed Regis demonstrates how science can and does provide us with a detailed understanding of the nature of life. Written in a lively and accessible style, and synthesizing a wide range of contemporary research, &lt;i&gt;What Is Life? &lt;/i&gt;is a brief and illuminating contribution to an age-old debate.&lt;/p&gt;" />
