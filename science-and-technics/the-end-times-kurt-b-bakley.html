  <title>The End Times - Kurt B. Bakley</title>
      <meta name="description" content="In this book we will read the ancient prophecies for the next 1000 years and beyond. It quite different then any other works on this subject, but I feel this is the correct one, I could be wrong. We will read the dates and time periods of Daniel and Revelation, all the Bible, Nostradamus and ancient Egyptian art to see what will happen and when. All prophecies in all books will be fulfilled if true during this time span. Se read on and see your future. Be sure to read my other books entitled: Predictions for 2015 Revised Edition, The Experiment at Philadelphia Revised Edition End Time Signs II and The End Times. Prophecies dont always happen the way we think they will and many times give more than one date, event and time. Some preachers call this secondary fulfillment. For the prophecies of this book to come true the events of September 24-28, and/or October 15-17, December 31, 29, 24-25, 14, 7 November 10-11,22, 2016 or 2017 must come to pass or else another type of future will happen. I explain this in this book and document how other books predicts four or five possible futures and from four or five one will come true as Isaac Newton and a woman in a life after death experience predicted. She said when she was dead she saw four or five futures unfold before her. She came back to life and forgot about them and one day in her kitchen she notice it was the exact copy of one of her futures she saw long ago when she was dead. One comes true out of four or five. If the people remain sinning the good prophecy could fail. This book was finished on December 14, 2015 (leave in)." />
