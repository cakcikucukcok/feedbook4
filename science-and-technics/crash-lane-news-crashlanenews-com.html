  CrashLaneNews.com presents original, simplified point of view about travel to help readers travel safer&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CALIFORNIA  The new book, Crash Lane News (published by AuthorHouse) from CrashLaneNews.com, combines security strategies and plans to help bring awareness to, and improve, traveler safety across the 50 United States, U.S. Territories and allies of the U.S. like South Korea, Taiwan, Japan and the Philippines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By combining stories of real-life situations with interviews and statistics, CrashLaneNews.com hopes to appeal to travelers who are looking for more than just dry news, but rather an all-inclusive story-based format that will appeal to their logical sides as well as their curiosity about real-life experiences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Information from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, the Department of Transportation and many more is included alongside accident, violation and disaster rates. Also included are interviews with the CTIA-The Wireless Association public relations office, NASA&#39;s Rani Gran, The National Weather Service, True Mileage&#39;s CEO Ryan Morrison, National Weather Service Interviews with Meteorologist Glen Field in Taunton, Massachusetts; Meteorologist Larry Ruthi in Dodge City, Kansas; and with additional meteorologists in Honolulu, Hawaii; North Carolina; Peach Tree City, Georgia; and Slidell/New Orleans, Louisiana; AAA Auto Clubs Public Relations Officer, Cynthia Harris, of AAAs Northern California, Nevada, and Utah regional office in San Francisco, California; National Insurance Crime Bureaus Public Affairs Director Frank Scafidi and more. Travel advice for travelers is included from the Department of the State and the FCC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An excerpt from Crash Lane News:&lt;br /&gt;
  In the years after 9/11 there was a big issue and discussion about how there is a lack of transparency in the United States about information relating to Homeland Security and disasters like Hurricane Katrina. The lack of transparency in the military, and what later happened to many of those that volunteered to serve the United States is horrific. But with all the casualties, injuries, and failures, change to correct these errors can be made.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CrashLaneNews.com&#39;s vision is to help travelers develop comprehensive plans for their own safety.&lt;br /&gt;
