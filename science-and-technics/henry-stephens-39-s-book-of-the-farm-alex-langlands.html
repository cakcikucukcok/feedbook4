  <title>Henry Stephens&#39;s Book of the Farm - Alex Langlands</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The Book of the Farm, written by the 19th-century farming expert Henry Stephens, was the indispensable farming &#39;bible&#39; referred to by the historians living and working on the BBC series Victorian Farm. This brand new version has been fully revised and edited by Alex Langlands, who starred on the programme, to bring its timeless wisdom to a fresh audience. Beautifully illustrated throughout with both black-and-white and colour illustrations, the book is a complete guide to the farming year, from planting thorn hedges in winter to pulling up potatoes in autumn. Along the way it gives fascinating information about every aspect of farming, from sheep shearing to bringing in the harvest, and practical instructions for skills such as cheese- making, animal husbandry, sheepdog training and other traditional country pastimes. Although farming has changed irrevocably since the 19th century, there are some aspects that remain timeless, and this exquisite book is a nostalgic celebration of our rural past." />
