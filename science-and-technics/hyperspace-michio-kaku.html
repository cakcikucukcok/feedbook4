  <title>Hyperspace - Michio Kaku</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Already thoroughly familiar to the seasoned science fiction fan, hyperspace is that realm which enables a spaceship captain to take his ship on a physics-defying shortcut (or &quot;wormhole&quot;) to the outer shores of the Galaxy in less time than it takes a 747 to fly from New York to Tokyo. But might such notions be more than science fiction? Some physicists suggest a 10-dimensional hyperspace may actually exist, albeit at a scale almost too small to comprehend, smaller
even than a quark; and that in spite of its tiny size, it may be the basis on which all the forces of nature will be united.
Michio Kaku&#39;s classic book describes the development of ideas about multidimensional space. In recent years, some theoretical physicists  -the author among them - have argued that the Universe exists not merely in the four spacetime dimensions (3 of space + one of time) with which Einstein made us familiar, but rather as a ten-dimensional hyperspace. Once the domain of the science fiction writer or the occultist, hyperspace may, according to superstring theorists, be the way to unify the
fundamental forces of nature - Einstein&#39;s unfulfilled dream of a theory of everything.
Michio Kaku takes the reader on a ride through hyperspace to the edge of physics. On the way he gives crystal clear explanations of such formidable mathematical concepts as non-Euclidean geometry, Kaluza-Klein Theory, and Supergravity, the everyday tools of the string theorist. Utilizing fascinating and often hilarious anecdotes from history, art, and science fiction, Kaku shows us that writers and artists - in addition to scientists - have been fascinated by multidimensional space for over a
century. Finally, Kaku proposes that the ability to master hyperspace may be our only salvation from destruction at the end of spacetime.
