      <meta name="description" content="&lt;b&gt;Feng Shui Demystified&lt;/B&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;I&gt;Feng Shui Demystified&lt;/I&gt; is one of the most understandable books written on feng shui. It was originally published by The Crossing Press in 2000 and became one of their best selling books. Readers say, &quot;This is the first time feng shui made sense.&quot; This new edition is greatly revised and expanded to include more illustrations, situations, solutions, and success stories. One of the most useful new sections is the Checklist for Moving.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Feng Shui Demystified is one of the The book explains why certain environments are conducive to harmony, prosperity, and health, and how to create those environments. It teaches how to minimize conflicts and arguments by avoiding the factors that signify their presence in your life.  The book examines the many obstacles that prevent a person from reaching their highest potential. It shows how to develop conscious awareness of the obstacles, minimize their effect, and remove them when possible. It explores the energy and symbolism of objects and how those aspects affect their placement. It is especially sensitive to renters who often have very little control over their home.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Feng Shui Demystified is one of the The writing is concise and powerful. When a problem is described, multiple solutions are always suggested. It explains the feng shui rules while encouraging you to cultivate your intuition and act on it. Author Clear Englebert draws from his own experience as a feng shui consultant to walk you through your home (and yard, and workplace, and even the car) with a consultant&#39;s eye. You will learn to observe how chi (Universal Energy) flows in and around your homewhere it is vibrant, where it stagnates, and where it picks up a negative charge. The book is a practical how-to guide rich with specific advice, including evocative explanations of the symbolic thought underlying feng shui concepts. The emphasis is on those concepts most accessible to the Western mind, and on those solutions most available to the modern reader.&lt;/p&gt;" />
