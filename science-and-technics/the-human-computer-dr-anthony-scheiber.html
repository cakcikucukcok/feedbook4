      <meta name="description" content="&lt;I&gt;The Human Computer: Get The Most Out of Yours&lt;/I&gt; is a book that will radically change the course of technology and medicine, and affect the entire spectrum of human relationships across the globe. &lt;I&gt;The Human Computer&lt;/I&gt; draws unprecedented and critical parallels between the human brain and the desktop computer. This book will touch and affect the lives of everyone on the planet, now and into the foreseeable future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How men and women think and approach life&#39;s problems is explained. Why teens struggle so much with their parents becomes exceedingly clear. The differences that have plagued relationships between men and women since antiquity are revealed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;I&gt;The Human Computer&lt;/I&gt; challenges many of the ancient and flawed paradigms that have been the cornerstones of society and scientific knowledge since antiquity. It is vitally important you read this book, to prepare for a new age of enlightenment. Understand what your Human Computer is all about...to take advantage of it in your career, your life&#39;s goals, your search for fortune...take advantage of its power in relationships...so that you can get the most out of yours.... The clock is ticking and time may be running out.&lt;/p&gt;" />
