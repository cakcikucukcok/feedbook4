  <title>God Does Not Play Dice: The Fulfillment of Einstein&#39;s Quest for Law and Order in Nature - David Ph.D. Shiang</title>
      <meta name="description" content="In this revolutionary and provocative work, David A. Shiang claims to offer final answers to many of humankind&amp;#39;s most enduring mysteries. He argues that Einstein was right in rejecting the randomness of quantum theory, and he shows that Stephen Hawking (A Brief History of Time) and Brian Greene (The Fabric of the Cosmos) are mistaken in saying that evidence shows nature to be probabilistic. He takes on Richard Dawkins (The God Delusion) and Daniel Dennett (Breaking the Spell), contending that Darwin&amp;#39;s theory of evolution by natural selection is neither scientific nor correct. He also maintains that worry and regret can be overcome, following in the footsteps of T.S. Eliot and other pioneers of the mind.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;Odds are high that the logical and elegant solutions Shiang presents to our deepest riddles will cause you to rethink your most fundamental beliefs.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;Very provocative, erudite, and solidly based on intelligent and logical thinking! Congratulations on making an excellent contribution to understanding the role of a higher intelligence in organizing the affairs of the universe!&amp;quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;- Pat McGovern, IDG Founder and Chairman, Co-founder of The McGovern Institute for Brain Research at MIT&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;His lucidity and logic are breathtakingly devastating. He is not afraid to defend the mind of God, either.... I cannot overstate the importance of Shiang&amp;#39;s work and its deep influence.&amp;quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;- Len Klikunas, Cultural Anthropologist" />
