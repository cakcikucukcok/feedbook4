  <title>Between the Twilight and the Rim: Finding Happiness - Sharon   Lenore Anderson, Ollie   Lynn Anderson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The meditative life and the search for God are encapsulated here in a story. It is not the saga of a renowned Saint or Sage, but the simple and pure expression of love in a small native boy as he discovers truths that blossom out of his own ancient traditions and are experienced anew. Ali sets out from the prairies of his homeland, through a settlement of town-folk and far beyond, seeking to become a man. He learns that in the process, finding happiness is the key. Inspired by the teachings of Yogananda and Swami Kriyananda. This story is illustrated with a vibrancy of charming characters and color, by Sharon&amp;#39;s sister Ollie Anderson. They grew up in northwestern Canada where the pristine majesty of nature would serve as the perfect inspirational backdrop for this timeless wilderness quest. brief excerpt: forward -- &amp;quot;Grandfather.. do all Holy People experience the same God?&amp;quot; &amp;quot;Of course Ali --truth is truth.&amp;quot; &amp;quot;What is the truth?&amp;quot; &amp;quot;That God brought everything into existence out of himself.&amp;quot; &amp;quot;So.. there is only one God?&amp;quot; &amp;quot;Yes, the one in you And everywhere.&amp;quot; Full excerpt and audio reading companion to Between the Twilight and the Rim can be found at the Sharon Lenore Anderson site.
