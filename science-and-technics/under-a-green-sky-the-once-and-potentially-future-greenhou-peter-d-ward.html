  <title>Under a Green Sky: The Once and Potentially Future Greenhou - Peter D. Ward</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;By looking backward at the course of great extinctions, a paleontologist sees what the future holds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;More than 200 million years ago, a cataclysmic event known as the Permian extinction destroyed more than 90 percent of all species and nearly 97 percent of all living things. Its origins have long been a puzzle for paleontologists. During the 1990s and the early part of this century, a great battle was fought between those who thought that death had come from above and those who thought something more complicated was at work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Paleontologist Peter. D. Ward, fresh from helping prove that an asteroid had killed the dinosaurs, turned to the Permian problem, and he has come to a stunning conclusion. In his investigations of the fates of several groups of mollusks during that extinction and others, he discovered that the near-total devastation at the end of the Permian period was caused by rising levels of carbon dioxide leading to climate change. But it&#39;s not the heat (nor the humidity) that&#39;s directly responsible for the extinctions, and the story of the discovery of what is responsible makes for a fascinating, globe-spanning adventure. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In &lt;em&gt;Under a Green Sky&lt;/em&gt;, Ward explains how the Permian extinction as well as four others happened, and describes the freakish oceans&amp;#8212;belching poisonous gas&amp;#8212;and sky&amp;#8212;slightly green and always hazy&amp;#8212;that would have attended them. Those ancient upheavals demonstrate that the threat of climate change cannot be ignored, lest the world&#39;s life today&amp;#8212;ourselves included&amp;#8212;face the same dire fate that has overwhelmed our planet several times before.&lt;/p&gt;" />
