  <title>Leibniz: A Very Short Introduction - Maria Rosa Antognazza</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz (1646-1716) was a man of extraordinary intellectual creativity who lived an exceptionally rich and varied intellectual life in troubled times. More than anything else, he was a man who wanted to improve the life of his fellow human beings through the advancement of all the sciences and the establishment of a stable and just political order.
In this Very Short Introduction Maria Rosa Antognazza outlines the central features of Leibniz&#39;s philosophy in the context of his overarching intellectual vision and aspirations. Against the backdrop of Leibniz&#39;s encompassing scientific ambitions, she introduces the fundamental principles of Leibniz&#39;s thought, as well as his theory of truth and theory of knowledge. Exploring Leibniz&#39;s contributions to logic, mathematics, physics, and metaphysics, she considers how his theories sat
alongside his concerns with politics, diplomacy, and a broad range of practical reforms: juridical, economic, administrative, technological, medical, and ecclesiastical. Discussing Leinbniz&#39;s theories of possible worlds, she concludes by looking at what is ultimately real in this actual world that we experience,
the good and evil there is in it, and Leibniz&#39;s response to the problem of evil through his theodicy.
