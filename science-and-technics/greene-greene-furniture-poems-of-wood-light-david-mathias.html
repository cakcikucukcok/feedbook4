  <title>Greene &amp; Greene Furniture: Poems of Wood &amp; Light - David Mathias</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p align=&quot;left&quot;&gt;One hundred years ago Charles and Henry Greene developed a new and distinctive architectural and decorative style that blended Arts &amp; Crafts and Asian influences with California sensibility and obsessive attention to detail. That innovative style is instantly recognizable today.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&quot;David Mathias, author of this richly personal appreciation of the Greenes&amp;#8230;comes to Greene and Greene from the perspective of an amateur woodworker with a fine aesthetic sense. Through his writing we are able to appreciate the Greenes&#39; houses and furnishings almost as if we were hearing from one of their builders. Through stunning and perceptive new photography, the illustrated spaces and furnishings illuminate the genius of the Greenes&#39; designs, material selection and craft, which has caused so many to celebrate and be seduced by their work&amp;#8230;Being a woodworker, Mathias also pays due homage to John and Peter Hall, the Swedish brothers who worked closely with the Greenes on their finest houses. Mathias correctly grasps how without the Halls, the Greenes would lack a significant measure of the reputation that they enjoy today. Relatively few writers have focused exclusively on Greene and Greene, and so it is a privilege whenever a talented one such as Mr. Mathias comes along. Be forewarned that through this book his seduction may become yours, too.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/i&gt;  Edward R. Bosley,  James N.
