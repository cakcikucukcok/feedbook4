  <title>Found in Translation - Genesis One - J. Roland Kent</title>
      <meta name="description" content="J.R. Kent has solved a 2,500-year-old mystery that defies both religion and science! Hidden in the thirty-one verses of Genesis One is a message so powerful it could ultimately change the course of global events. Our hi-tech world is barely a century old, and already life altering environmental, terrorist, political, economic, and health threats pose potentially dire consequences for our future. However, many of the ancient, advanced civilizations such as the Egyptians, the Greeks, the Romans and the Mayans of Central America endured for thousands of years. So what was their secret, and how is it revealed in the Genesis verses?  
Genesis One is an ancient creation account for the earth, plants, animals, and humankind. However, when reading these verses they may seem bewildering and out of the natural order. The premise of this book illustrates in startling detail that this amazing storyin factperfectly correlates with the theories of modern science! There are several reasons why this mystery has not been revealed until now. First, an ancient author wrote this account in the original Hebrew language, but the actual evolutionary sequence of the Earth that he so accurately revealed has been lost in translation by the many biblical versions that followed. Second, the discoveries of modern science now put us at a point in time when this correlation has now been found in translation. This revelation then begs two questions. How was this knowledge possible in ancient times, and who wrote it?" />
