  <title>Galactic Travel at Warp Speed in Imaginary Time - Charles E. Anzalone</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;B&gt;Galactic Travel at Warp Speed in Imaginary Time&lt;/B&gt; 
&lt;P&gt;When all the technical articles from magazines, newspapers, and published books are correlated, it becomes very apparent that mankind is on the verge of discovering a new frontiera frontier called imaginary time.  This isnt a dreamworld but rather, a place in the space-time continuum where spacecraft can travel at warp speeds throughout the galaxy.  This book is not a science fiction book.  Unlike other scientific approaches that are formal, conservative, and trite, this book delves into equations and techniques that suggest a different method of galactic travel other than power-driven machines.  This book points the way toward governmental research that will be more productive than the rocket approach of today.  The link that makes warp speeds feasible is the association with neutrinos and their speed relative to the speed of light.  Present day understanding of the neutrino is very limited.  Scientists can create them and send them to a location, but neutrinos created by our sun and other stars in the galaxy are different.   They have a property that can be used to propel a spacecraft!&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Illustrations detail the construction of a time shifter and the final version of a spacecraft.  Construction of the time shifter is necessary to obtain the critical electromagnetic properties that will be used in the spacecraft.  To achieve speeds greater than the speed of light, a new understanding of Einsteins law or E = mc has to be made.  Einsteins laws on relativity still apply, but a new frontier with a better understanding of  &quot;&lt;B&gt;time&lt;/B&gt;&quot; is necessary.  The major form of time that mankind knows today is the alarm clock going off in the morning.  This book will discuss three other forms of time; namely, imaginary time, galactic sector time, and a Biblical time line from which critical information about our past is derived.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;In the latter chapters, several hypotheses are proposed along with axioms that point toward the feasibility of several theories as correct.  These theories are backed-up with research provided by the Bible and astronomical data for our solar system.  Advanced theories of this magnitude require that &lt;I&gt;we know where we came from before we can understand where were going.&lt;/I&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;The Bible provides a clue so that space travelers will know what to expect when they travel across the galaxy.  The clue leads to a special section titled Rib Theory.  With an understanding of Rib Theory, logical conclusions point out that the Earth is twenty six percent (yes 26%) closer to the sun than it was back in 23,350 BC.  Astronomical data confirms that the orbit of Earth and Mars are very different than orbits of other planets.  Additional evidence is documented with photographs, magazines, and other books to illustrate significant changes that occurred here on Earth before man learned how to write. With a better understanding of global warming and the real causes, mankind will be motivated to take measures now.  Were running out of time and major research has to be started as soon as possible.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;In retrospect, the purpose of this book is twofold.  The first goal is to point the way toward a methodology for galactic travel and what to expect traveling at warp speed.  The second goal is to benefit mankind so that his dependence on fossil fuels is reduced with alternative energy and his understanding of the world around him is improved.&lt;/P&gt;
