  <title>Reliability, Maintainability, and Supportability - Michael Tortorella</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Focuses on the core systems engineering tasks of writing, managing, and tracking requirements for reliability, maintainability, and supportability that are most likely to satisfy customers and lead to success for suppliers&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;/b&gt;This book helps systems engineers lead the development of systems and services whose reliability, maintainability, and supportability meet and exceed the expectations of their customers and promote success and profit for their suppliers. This book is organized into three major parts: reliability, maintainability, and supportability engineering. Within each part, there is material on requirements development, quantitative modelling, statistical analysis, and best practices in each of these areas. Heavy emphasis is placed on correct use of language. The author discusses the use of various sustainability engineering methods and techniques in crafting requirements that are focused on the customers’ needs, unambiguous, easily understood by the requirements’ stakeholders, and verifiable. Part of each major division of the book is devoted to statistical analyses needed to determine when requirements are being met by systems operating in customer environments. To further support systems engineers in writing, analyzing, and interpreting sustainability requirements, this book also&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;Contains “Language Tips” to help systems engineers learn the different languages spoken by specialists and non-specialists in the sustainability disciplines&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Provides exercises in each chapter, allowing the reader to try out some of the ideas and procedures presented in the chapter&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Delivers end-of-chapter summaries of the current reliability, maintainability, and supportability engineering best practices for systems engineers&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Reliability, Maintainability, and Supportability&lt;/i&gt; is a reference for systems engineers and graduate students hoping to learn how to effectively determine and develop appropriate requirements so that designers may fulfil the intent of the customer.&lt;/p&gt;" />
