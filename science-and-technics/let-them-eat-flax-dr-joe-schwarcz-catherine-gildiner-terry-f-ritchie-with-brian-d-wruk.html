  <title>Let Them Eat Flax! - Dr. Joe Schwarcz, Catherine Gildiner, Terry F. Ritchie with Brian D. Wruk</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Do you know if your waiter sings in the bathroom? Or if the lady who whipped up the icing on your cake wore false fingernails? When was the last time you microwaved your dishcloth? Is your orange juice pasteurized? In Let Them Eat Flax!, award-winning author Dr. Joe Schwarcz explains why these are more important questions than whether you eat fresh or farmed salmon, whether genetically modified foods should be labeled, or whether fruits and vegetables harbor traces of pesticides.
In Let Them Eat Flax!, Dr. Joe Schwarcz continues his crusade against purveyors of poppycock as he investigates the surprising and sometimes sinister science of everyday food and life. What difference does an atom make? It could mean life or death! Get the lowdown on oxygenated water, the healing powers of prayer, and the health benefits of chocolate. Could there be a link between McGill University and Jack the Ripper? Find out how cinnamon helps to counter high cholesterol, and learn just how sweet sugar alternatives can be. 
In the tradition of Dr. Joe&#39;s five previous best-sellers, Let Them Eat Flax! fries scientific baloney with humour, wit, and information. From food poisoning to the secret of the Stradivarius violin, fertilizers to spontaneous human combustion, Dr. Joe investigates explosive subjects and delivers the unbiased, scientific facts readers need to make informed decisions in their everyday lives." />
