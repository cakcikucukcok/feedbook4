  <title>The Vertical Farm - Dr. Dickson Despommier, Majora Carter</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&quot;The vertical farm is a world-changing innovation whose time has come. Dickson Despommier&#39;s visionary book provides a blueprint for securing the world&#39;s food supply and at the same time solving one of the gravest environmental crises facing us today.&quot;--Sting&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Imagine a world where every town has their own local food source, grown in the safest way possible, where no drop of water or particle of light is wasted, and where a simple elevator ride can transport you to nature&#39;s grocery store - imagine the world of the vertical farm.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When Columbia professor Dickson Despommier set out to solve America&#39;s food, water, and energy crises, he didn&#39;t just think big - he thought &lt;i&gt;up. &lt;/i&gt;Despommier&#39;s stroke of genius, the vertical farm, has excited scientists, architects, and politicians around the globe. Now, in this groundbreaking book, Despommier explains how the vertical farm will have an incredible impact on changing the face of this planet for future generations. &lt;br&gt;Despommier takes readers on an incredible journey inside the vertical farm, buildings filled with fruits and vegetables that will provide local food sources for entire cities. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Vertical farms will allow us to: &lt;br&gt;- Grow food 24 hours a day, 365 days a year&lt;br&gt;- Protect crops from unpredictable and harmful weather &lt;br&gt;- Re-use water collected from the indoor environment&lt;br&gt;- Provide jobs for residents &lt;br&gt;- Eliminate use of pesticides, fertilizers, or herbicides&lt;br&gt;-  Drastically reduce dependence on fossil fuels &lt;br&gt;- Prevent crop loss due to shipping or storage&lt;br&gt;- Stop agricultural runoff&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Vertical farms can be built in abandoned buildings and on deserted lots, transforming our cities into urban landscapes which will provide fresh food grown and harvested just around the corner. Possibly the most important aspect of vertical farms is that they can built by nations with little or no arable land, transforming nations which are currently unable to farm into top food producers. In the tradition of the bestselling &lt;i&gt;The World Without Us&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;The Vertical Farm &lt;/i&gt;is a completely original landmark work destined to become an instant classic.&lt;/p&gt;" />
