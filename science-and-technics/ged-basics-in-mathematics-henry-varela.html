  <title>Ged Basics in Mathematics - Henry Varela</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;The aim of this book is to present the subject matter of arithmetic, geometry, and algebra with the utmost clarity and simplicity. It is based on the mathematical subjects required in four years of high school study and will prepare the student with the skills necessary to pass the GED Mathematics Test. The text consists of ten chapters with a review of geometry and algebra because of the many concepts introduced in these particular subjects. The last chapter is devoted to a practice test consisting of questions and problems similar to those presented on the real GED test. Answers to the practice test are provided with detailed explanations of the suggested method of solving each problem.
&lt;P&gt;Each chapter opens with a brief introduction before developing the ideas and facts of the subject matter. In order to give the student an insight into the principle involved, many examples are given to provide an understanding of the topic rather than to just offer a rule. The examples enable students to proceed at their own pace, in accordance with their individual needs. Problems are then introduced for the student to solve so as to stimulate clear and organized thinking. Answers to the problems are included at the end of each chapter thus helping to reinforce the students&#39; knowledge step by step.
&lt;P&gt;Due to the fact that the language is direct, and the method of presentation is concerned with essentials only, the skills can be learned by anyone willing to spend some time in self-study. Also, even though simplified, this book of mathematics is complete and authoritative. It is recommended for use in home schooling, as a supplementary text, or as a gateway to advanced math and science.
