But this has started to change. The new scientific frontier is the human body: the greatest engineers of our generation have turned their sights inward, and their work is beginning to revolutionize mankind.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In &lt;em&gt;The Body Builders,&lt;/em&gt; Adam Piore takes us on a fascinating journey into the field of bioengineering&amp;#8212;which can be used to reverse engineer, rebuild, and augment human beings&amp;#8212;and paints a vivid portrait of the people at its center. Chronicling the ways new technology has retooled our physical expectations and mental processes, Piore visits people who have regrown parts of their fingers and legs in the wake of terrible traumas, tries on a muscle suit that allows him to lift ninety pounds with his fingertips, dips into the race to create &amp;#8220;Viagra for the brain,&amp;#8221; and shadows the doctors trying to give mute patients the ability to communicate telepathically. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As science continues to lay bare the mysteries of human performance, it is helping us to see&amp;#8212;and exist&amp;#8212;above our expectations. &lt;em&gt;The Body Builders&lt;/em&gt; will take readers beyond the headlines and the hype to introduce them to the inner workings and the outer reaches of our bodies and minds, and explore how new developments are changing, and will forever change, what is possible for humankind.&lt;/p&gt;" />
