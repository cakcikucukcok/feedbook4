      <meta name="description" content="&lt;i&gt;Telecom Management for Call Centers&lt;/i&gt; offers a practical guide to addressing the most common issues faced by telecom management in large call-centers. This handbook was written primarily for the telecom manager; the techniques described here are practical and easily applicable, focusing on the issues the telecom manager faces in his or her daily operational work.
