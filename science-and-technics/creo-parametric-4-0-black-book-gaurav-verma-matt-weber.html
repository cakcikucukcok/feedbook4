  <title>Creo Parametric 4.0 Black Book - Gaurav Verma, Matt Weber</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;Creo Parametric 4.0 Black Book&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;is the second edition of our series on Creo Parametric. With lots of additions and thorough review, we present a book to help professionals as well as learners in creating some of the most complex solid models. The book follows a step by step methodology. In this book, we have tried to give real-world examples with real challenges in designing. We have tried to reduce the gap between university use of Creo Parametric and industrial use of Creo Parametric. In this edition of book, we have included many new features of Creo Parametric like 3D printing, MBD (Model Based Definition), Family tables, Mechanism Design, 3D PDFs, and so on.&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;There are about 60 topics newly added in this book which were not in the previous edition.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;The book covers almost all the information required by a learner to master Creo Parametric. The book starts with sketching and ends at advanced topics like Sheetmetal, Surface Design, 3D Printing and MBD. Some of the salient features of this book are :&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;In-Depth explanation of concepts&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Every new topic of this book starts with the explanation of the basic concepts. In this way, the user becomes capable of relating the things with real world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Topics Covered&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Every chapter starts with a list of topics being covered in that chapter. In this way, the user can easy find the topic of his/her interest easily.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Instruction through illustration&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The instructions to perform any action are provided by maximum number of illustrations so that the user can perform the actions discussed in the book easily and effectively. There are about 1200 small and large illustrations that make the learning process effective.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Tutorial point of view&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
At the end of concept&amp;rsquo;s explanation, the tutorial make the understanding of users firm and long lasting. Almost each chapter of the book has tutorials that are real world projects. Moreover most of the tools in this book are discussed in the form of tutorials.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Project&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Free projects and exercises are provided to students for practicing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;For Faculty&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
If you are a faculty member, then you can ask for video tutorials on any of the topic, exercise, tutorial, or concept.&lt;/p&gt;
