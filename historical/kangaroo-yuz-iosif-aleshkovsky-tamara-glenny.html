  <title>Kangaroo - Yuz Iosif Aleshkovsky, Tamara Glenny</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;One morning in 1949, Fan Fanych, alias Etcetera, is summoned from his Moscow apartment to KGB headquarters, where he is informed that he will be charged with a crime more heinous than any mere man could ever devise.  Comrade Etcetera will be tried for &quot;the vicious rape and murder of an aged kangaroo in the Moscow Zoo on a night between July 14, 1789, and January 9, 1905.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Every moment in the nightmarish and hilarious account that follows lives up to the absurdity of this accusation.  A seductive KGB agent attempts to convince Fan Fanych that he is a kangaroo; he finds himself in the dock at a spectacular show trial; is sent to a camp full of dedicated old Bolsheviks pathetically attempting to maintain their beliefs in the face of every new atrocity; encounters Hitler in Berlin and Churchill, Roosevelt, and Stalin at Yalta, where he is privileged to witness the famous conference as it was &lt;i&gt;really &lt;/i&gt;conducted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Kangaroo &lt;/i&gt;is a savage, cleansing satire in which Yuz Aleshkovsky confronts the hypocrisy, the cruelty, and the tragic failure of the Soviet regime.  His phantasmagoria is faithful to reality, for--as Dostoevsky knew--it is impossible for &quot;realism&quot; to portray a society whose corruption is literally fantastic.&lt;/p&gt;" />
