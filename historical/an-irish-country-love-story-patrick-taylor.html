  <title>An Irish Country Love Story - Patrick Taylor</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;An Irish Country Love Story &lt;/i&gt;is the eleventh heartwarming installment in &lt;i&gt;New York Times &lt;/i&gt;and &lt;i&gt;Globe and Mail &lt;/i&gt;bestselling author Patrick Taylor&#39;s beloved Irish Country series.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s the winter of 1967 and snow is on the ground in the colorful Irish village of Ballybucklebo, but the chilly weather can&#39;t stop love from warming hearts all over the county. Not just the love between a man and woman, as with young doctor, Barry Laverty, and his fiancee Sue Nolan, who are making plans to start a new life together, but also the love of an ailing pensioner for a faithful dog that&#39;s gone missing, the love of the local gentry for the great estate they are on verge of losing, or Doctor Fingal Flahertie O&#39;Reilly&#39;s deep and abiding love for his long-time home and practice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For decades, ever since the war, Number One Main Street, Ballybucklebo, has housed O&#39;Reilly and his practice. In recent years, it has also opened its doors to O&#39;Reilly&#39;s wife, Barry Laverty, and a new addition to the practice, Doctor Nonie Stevens, a sultry and occasionally prickly young woman who may not be fitting in as well as she should. It is to Number One that patients young and old come when they need a doctor&#39;s care, for everything from the measles to a rare and baffling blood disease. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An unexpected turn of events threatens to drive O&#39;Reilly from his home for good, unless the entire village can rally behind their doctor and prove that love really can conquer all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the Publisher&#39;s request, this title is being sold without Digital Rights Management Software (DRM) applied.&lt;/p&gt;" />
