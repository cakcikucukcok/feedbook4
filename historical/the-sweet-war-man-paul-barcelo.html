  <title>The Sweet War Man - Paul Barcelo</title>
      <meta name="description" content="As Second Lieutenant RANDY THAYER begins his Army training, ANDREA TREMBLAY is willing to accept him as a soldier, but doesnt want him to go to war. Randy seeks the answer to why men follow the profession of arms. In seeking this quest, he has chosen to be one of the new charioteers, a rotary wing pilot in the war known as the Helicopter War, Vietnam. To keep him from her own fears of war, Andrea tries to enlist his support in a climb to power in her fathers industrial company. Can the security of luxury entice Randy from his middle class background? Each faces different challenges, which slowly begins to pull them apart. Can their relationship survive? Randy is caught in the Armys downsizing from the fading war. Andrea, aligned with her father, faces challenges of introducing new products into the conservative Tremblay family, entrenched in their stagnant interests. FAITH BECKWERTH, the neighborhood girl, vies for Randys affection with an iron-willed determination. She supports his beliefs, listens to him, and supports him in his times of fear and need. Yet, Randy is still drawn to Andrea, and the physical pleasure of their love." />
