  <title>Steinman - Leo Kearley</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The Travis family struggles to cope with the changes after Albie Travis took his own life, and yet, the assassination of the Austrian Crown Prince will change the lives of Colin and Joe in ways they cannot imagine. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the Steinman family, the impending conflict suits their brand of industrialised warfare. Klaus Steinman&amp;rsquo;s artillery unit, the Terror Group, intends to obliterate the Belgian Army and trample across France to force an Allied surrender.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the cusp of war, Colin and Joe are convicted of wrongdoing. Imprisoned on the word of a vengeful Colonel John Weston, the lads must survive the cruelest of regimes. Conditionally released, the boys are enlisted in the army and, despite their age, are sent to France to be trained as scouts. On the Western Front, under the command of the hated John Weston, destiny dictates the boys will face off against the Terror Group as they deploy the most insidious of weapons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hailing from Christchurch, England, Leo Kearley loved all things military as a child. Studies of Britain&amp;rsquo;s Empire in his youth defined a passion for history and a desire to travel. In his twenties, Leo moved to New Zealand and then Australia, where colonial history, combined with European politics, fuelled his desire to become a writer. His IT architecture career gives discipline to a vivid imagination, allowing Leo to create characters and stories that immerse his readers, as ragtag heroes battle tyranny through the most volatile times of the twentieth century.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;" />
