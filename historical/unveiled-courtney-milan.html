      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Of all Ash Turner&#39;s accomplishments, stealing a dukedom from his old enemy is by far the most brazen.

Now Ash wants to take her family home, too. She disguises herself as a nurse, determined to learn his weaknesses. But the closer she comes to Ash, the greater the pull of his reckless charm. If she wants to reclaim what she has lost, her only choice is to betray the man she is beginning to love...&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;This is an enhanced ebook.
