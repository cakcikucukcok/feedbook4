  <title>Mccurry’S War - Chucky Thompson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Coming of age during the Vietnam War, Mike McCurry decides to join the
U.S. Army rather than be drafted or take a fl ight to Canada. He is assigned
to the Army Security Agency and begins a life of covert operation as a voice
interceptor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the late 1960s, McCurry arrives at Teufelsberg, a super-secret listening
station in West Berlin. McCurry and his fellow operatives have direct access to
some of the most sensitive conversations of top offi cials of the East German
governments Central Committee in East Berlin. Unfortunately, McCurrys group
of interpreters and analysts are supervised by regular Army personnel, who
have no idea of the tasks being carried out by those under their command.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;McCurrys supervisors are more interested in how their troops perform on the
drill field than how they are fulfilling their assigned intelligence mission, and
that doesnt sit well with McCurry when national security is at stake. It doesnt take him long to recognize that it will require a combination of guile and humor
to overcome the obstacles put in his path by clueless supervisors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the incompetence of the leadership ultimately becomes deadly, forcing
McCurry to make a choice between following orders  or facing a court martial.&lt;/p&gt;" />
