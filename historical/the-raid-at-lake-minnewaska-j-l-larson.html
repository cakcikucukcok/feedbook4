  <title>The Raid at Lake Minnewaska - J. L. Larson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;It was a warm June weekend in 1931 when five people met coincidentally at a lake town in Minnesota. Three of the five were outsiders. Two law school buddies, James Lawton and Charlie Davis were in town on a lark, but immediately began noticing some strange happenings at a nearby lake resort. The other, Lindy MacPherson, had more serious business. As an inexperienced investigator from the Minneapolis branch of the U.S. Attorneys office, her task was to explore a rumor about an alleged gambling operation in the vicinity of Lake Minnewaska. It was supposed to be a simple job neither lengthy nor precariousmore to give her investigative experience while under cover as a travel magazine writer. Shed been observing the same odd occurrences in the town.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other two, a local father and son, John and Adam Bailey, had been ignoring these unusual activities and antics of the peculiar assortment of guests at nearby Chippewa Lodge like everyone else in town. It had been best to do so for the good of the community. Glenwood was thriving during an otherwise very difficult economic time all around the country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MacPhersons orders had been strict. If she were to find any evidence relating to illegal gambling, she would leave Glenwood and promptly turn over her findings to the state patrol or the Bureau of Investigation and let them handle any potential arrests. MacPherson did not have an exemplary record of following strict orders --especially when prompt action was needed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Normally, taking on the mob would not be considered by anyone in their right mind. That weekend these five people made a decision. Circumstances required their immediate attention.&lt;/p&gt;" />
