  <title>Soaring Eagle with Many Coups - James Safreno</title>
      <meta name="description" content="As with everyone, we all go down the path of life. Sometimes that path becomes rough and dangerous, and sometimes the path is just the opposite. So it is with James York. Set in the 1800s this story is a novel based on reality about a person who was forced to leave his loved ones at an early age. He was constantly attacked by hostile natives and raised by the Shoshone who lived near the Snake River. James York becomes a great Shoshone warrior and mountain man feared by his enemies, while being honored by friends. He stepped out of the white mans world and entered an Native American world, almost totally purging all that was white in him. He did this only to be forced back in the white world again, and in doing so, there is a battle within him between the red man and white mans world. With all the pain he must go through in his life, he seems to be able to cope and adapt. As his spirit guide said to him, You will live for a long time and have many children. Also there will be some sadness and some happiness. You will be feared by some, as well as admired by others, and you will have great wealth. His spirit guide was correct. He did live long and had the wealth of many descendants, as well as fortune, and his stature was known in America and Britain." />
