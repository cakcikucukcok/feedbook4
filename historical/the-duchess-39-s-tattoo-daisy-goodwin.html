  <title>The Duchess&#39;s Tattoo - Daisy Goodwin</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&quot;Anyone suffering Downton Abbey withdrawal symptoms (who isn&#39;t?) will find an instant tonic in Daisy Goodwin&#39;s The American Heiress. The story of Cora Cash, an American heiress in the 1890s who bags an English duke, this is a deliciously evocative first novel that lingers in the mind.&quot; --Allison Pearson, New York Times bestselling author of I Don&#39;t Know How She Does It and I Think I Love You&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&quot;For daughters of the new American billionaires of the 19th century, it was the ultimate deal: marriage to a cash-strapped British Aristocrat in return for a title and social status. But money didn&#39;t always buy them happiness.&quot; --DAISY GOODWIN IN THE DAILY MAIL&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Traveling abroad with her mother at the turn of the twentieth century to seek a titled husband, beautiful, vivacious Cora Cash, whose family mansion in Newport dwarfs the Vanderbilts&#39;, suddenly finds herself Duchess of Wareham, married to Ivo, the most eligible bachelor in England. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In &quot;The Duchess&#39;s Tattoo&quot;, Cora Cash is desperate to be a fashionable lady of society. Despite her title and her wealth, she finds that English society is not that welcoming to &quot;The American Duchess.&quot; When Cora spies a distinctive snake tattoo on her mother-in-law&#39;s wrist, she decides that she must have one as well. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is up to the talented tattoo artist to save &quot;The American Duchess&quot; from herself. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;In addition to the short story, &quot;The Duchess Tattoo&quot;, this also contains a letter from the author, Daisy Goodwin, on writing THE AMERICAN HEIRESS, an excerpt from &quot;Titled Americans&quot;, an authentic quarterly publication from 1890 which listed all of the eligible titled bachelors still on the market, and an excerpt from AN AMERICAN HEIRESS, a moving and brilliantly entertaining debut novel coming from St. Martin&#39;s Press in June. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />
