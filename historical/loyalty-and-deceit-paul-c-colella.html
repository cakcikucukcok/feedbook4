  <title>Loyalty and Deceit - Paul C. Colella</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Paul C. Colellas literary endeavor is the sequel to his first book &lt;i&gt;Patriots and Scoundrels: Charitys First Adventure&lt;/i&gt;. In the sequel, two years have past since young Charity Chastines arrival to post-Revolutionary War America and she continues struggling to find her place in American society among the privileged and common classes with their sorrows and joys, stories and secrets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Charity is involved with a gallery of individuals she has named patriots and scoundrels who have lured her into a web of deception, deceit, and treachery. As she tries to separate the heroes from the villains, she becomes entangled in the desperate search for a hidden treasure and a priceless diamond while being stalked by a mysterious stranger and haunted by the apparitions of a young local girl and her Redcoat boyfriend whose murders were never solved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What shocking and inevitable events await poor Charity? Who will come to her rescue? How will these encounters, along with a favorite and mysterious doll in her possession affect Charitys life and the people around her who walk a thin line between loyalty and deceit?&lt;/p&gt;" />
