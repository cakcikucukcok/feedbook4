  <title>Our Lives - John Connolly</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;A series of stories that provide a picture of struggle and strength in many different societies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What makes history live? Stories about individuals who take us to places we have not been.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Learning about the lives of girls and women over a lengthy period of time will stimulate discussion about those lives as well as their counterparts today.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Each life lived has a story we can learn from. In &lt;em&gt;Our Lives: Girls and Womens Stories Across Two Millennia&lt;/em&gt;, editor John Connolly offers ten short fiction stories penned by&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;young writers that provide pictures of the struggle and strength of girls and women&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;in many different societies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These stories may take us to unfamiliar places, as the girls and womens images come to life through original sketches. Hoski tells the story of a young Navajo girl living in the period around 1400 in what is now the United States; it explores her relationship with her grandmother and explains why she needs to be strong. Gaia Valeria introduces Gaia, a fifteen-year-old from a wealthy family living in Pompeii during the Roman Empire, and compares her life with that of her slave. The Diary of Zhang Lihua shares excerpts from the diary of a young woman living in northern China near the end of the sixth century as she describes her family and political changes taking place at that time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Making history come alive, &lt;em&gt;Our Lives &lt;/em&gt;is intended to stimulate discussion about the lives of girls and women and their struggles and triumphs of yesteryear and what it means to todays society.&lt;/p&gt;
