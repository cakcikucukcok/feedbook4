  <title>Driven by a Dream - Neva Andrews</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Time never stands still for Jo Barkley. Now a young woman, she is madly in love with her childhood friend, Bob Blackwood. As she stands beside Killdeer Lake and happily accepts his marriage proposal, World War II rages across Europe. Both thrilled and frightened amid the chaos surrounding 1941 America, Jo cannot help but wonder if her dream of owning a ranch will ever come true. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is not long before Bob is pulled into the conflict and joins the army. Desperate to earn money and stop fearing for Bobs life, Jo begins training to become a teacher. When her training is interrupted by her mothers illness and eventual death, Jo ignores Gods call, leaves her teaching career behind, and begins searching for more lucrative ways to save for her ranch. When a rodeo cowboy convinces her to disguise herself as a young man and join him in Pro Rodeo, Jo thinks her problem is solved. Now only time will tell if she can continue living a lie to fulfill her dream. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Driven by a Dream&lt;/i&gt; continues the tale of an independent young womans journey as she enters adulthood during World War II and begins pursuing her lifelong goal of owning a ranch. &lt;/p&gt;" />
