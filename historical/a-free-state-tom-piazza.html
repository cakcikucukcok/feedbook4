  <title>A Free State - Tom Piazza</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The author of &lt;em&gt;City of Refuge&lt;/em&gt; returns with a startling and powerful novel of race, violence, and identity set on the eve of the Civil War.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The year is 1855. Blackface minstrelsy is the most popular form of entertainment in a nation about to be torn apart by the battle over slavery. Henry Sims, a fugitive slave and a brilliant musician, has escaped to Philadelphia, where he earns money living by his wits and performing on the street. He is befriended by James Douglass, leader of a popular minstrel troupe struggling to compete with dozens of similar ensembles, who imagines that Henry&amp;#8217;s skill and magnetism might restore his troupe&amp;#8217;s sagging fortunes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The problem is that black and white performers are not allowed to appear together onstage. Together, the two concoct a masquerade to protect Henry&amp;#8217;s identity, and Henry creates a sensation in his first appearances with the troupe. Yet even as their plan begins to reverse the troupe&amp;#8217;s decline, a brutal slave hunter named Tull Burton has been employed by Henry&amp;#8217;s former master to track down the runaway and retrieve him, by any means necessary.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bursting with narrative tension and unforgettable characters, shot through with unexpected turns and insight, &lt;em&gt;A Free State&lt;/em&gt; is a thrilling reimagining of the American story by a novelist at the height of his powers.&lt;/p&gt;" />
