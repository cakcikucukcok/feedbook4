  <title>Mary Magdalene; My Story - Teresa L. Adams</title>
      <meta name="description" content="There are many theories and legends revolving around Mary Magdalene, the friend and companion of Jesus of Nazareth during first century Roman Empire. Some say she was a vile sinner; others, a saint.  Some have said she was a prostitute; others, a chaste Jewish woman.   Many lands around the Great Sea still tell tales of Mary Magdalenes travels and accomplishments in their part and plot of history.  
Although few legends are considered to be of a factual nature, neither should they be thought of strictly as fairytales.  Many legends have their basis in true stories which have been passed down through a hundred or more generations and  sometimes the information has evolved into much more than what it started as and has come to even enhance the meaning and spirit of the original events. 
While there is not enough documented history to write a non-fictional biography of Mary herself, there is much information about first century Judea in the Roman Empire, the time and place into which Mary was born. Much is also known about some of the people who were most likely to have been her companions, particularly those written about in the Christian Bible, like Saint Peter, Saint John, Martha, Jesus, his mother, Saul of Tarsus and others.  In writing this narrative of Mary Magdalene, my intent was to include as much legendary material as possible, being careful not to contradict any  historical facts about Mary herself or any other historical figure appearing in the book.  I spent much time accessing and studying information from a wide variety of sources.  My research led to me draw some conclusions about what must have been known back then, but was not considered important enough to have been written down, such as who was related to whom, who went where and when and the chronology of certain events. 
	Let this story answer questions for you that might have been lingering in your mind for a long time now, such as: What did happen to Mary called the Magdalene before she met Jesus of Nazareth?  What was her background?  Did she have other family?  Did Jesus?  Why did Jesus have to cast demons out of her?    What was the Essene Community?  Was Jesus a member?  Was Mary?  What happened to her after Jesus died?  Can regretful decisions ever be turned around for the good? 
	Mary Magdalene; My Story will take you through the world of a young Jewish girl with all of the hopes, dreams and expectations that any young girl would naturally have.  You will learn how tragedies in her life nearly killed her, but how she was saved by the love of a man, and kept by the love of those who realized that second chances were God-given and to be respected.  You will see how she in turn offered forgiveness to those who had hurt her so deeply and how good things came as a result of that.
Mary had friends who loved and understood her and were important people to her throughout her life.  As a reader, we get to meet them all and come to love them ourselves.  Learn more about Joana and Cuza, Mary mother of Jesus, Agabus, Antipus, and Lydia, the woman who sold purple things.  This story will weave all of the different characters and events and places of the time into a heartwarming tale you are not soon to forget.  With such a variety of characters mostly likely every reader will find someone in the story to whom they will relate in a personal way.
	Let Mary take you, in her own voice, through the early days of Christianity, through the turbulent times of the Roman Emperor Nero and the Jewish wars.  Let her share with you the sorrow of losing some of her best friends and the joys of developing new ones.  She will tell you of the trade that carried her through many years of her life and was the reason she was able to go on a great adventure around the Empire.  At times the reader will be moved to tears, at times will laugh out loud as she tells you about the wonder of raising children and finding true love against all odds.
