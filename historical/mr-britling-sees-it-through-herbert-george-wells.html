  <title>Mr Britling Sees It Through - Herbert George Wells</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This story is essentially the history of the opening and of the realisation of the Great War as it happened to one small group of people in Essex, and more particularly as it happened to one human brain. „Mr. Britling Sees It Through” begins with a lighthearted account of an American visiting England for the first time, but the outbreak of war changes everything. Day by day and month by month, Wells chronicles the unfolding events and public reaction as witnessed by the inhabitants of one house in rural Essex. Each of the characters tries in a different way to keep their bearings in a world suddenly changed beyond recognition. The novel was written and published before the war ended, so there is no victory, no Versailles Treaty and no notion of what is to come." />
