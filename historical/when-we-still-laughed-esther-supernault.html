  <title>When We Still Laughed - Esther Supernault</title>
      <meta name="description" content="It is 1863, and a bitter Cree warrior named Broken Arrow stalks a lone Irishman called Mac, as he hobbles across the blistering prairie that is now known as Manitoba, Canada. Mac is surprised to find, however, that his traveling companion does intend to kill him, and the two become fast friends as they attempt to survive the harsh climate. 
Although the men are comrades, differing values and cultures threaten to tear their friendship apart. Mac is drawn to the mystical side of the land, finding parallels in ancient goddess history and comfort in his Celtic heritage as he learns First Nation beliefs. But he must first face his inner fears before he is worthy of meeting an ancient Mother Earth spirit known as Mud Woman, who visits him in his dreams. Broken Arrow, on the other hand, becomes more and more alienated due to the white mans encroaching destruction and greed. He seeks guidance from Powakan, an ancient spirit who teaches him to think for himself. 
When We Still Laughed is the story of these men and their journeys as some of the last pioneers in a new and changing world where French trappers, Metis hunters, Celtic pioneers, and First Nation warriors gather together and build Canadas history through their stories and laughter." />
