  <title>Generations of Love - Patricia Smith Janssen</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;It is 1878, and Jeremiah and Matilda Dunniff are broke. After the linen industry crumbles, the young Irish couple realizes they have no way to make money. With an eviction notice hanging over their heads, they decide to immigrate to America with hopes of creating a better life. They are unaware that, across the Atlantic, more hardship awaits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the Dunniff family arrives in New York City, they are forced to move into the tenements, where Jeremiah soon recognizes that the streets in America are not paved with gold. As he becomes angry and turns to the bottle for comfort, Matilda discovers she is pregnant with another child, whom she later names Rose. Unfortunately, Jeremiah is on a path of self-destruction; after Rose enters sixth grade, he dies from alcoholism. Rose, forced to grow up much sooner than normal, falls in love with the theater and begins acting. As Rose begins her own journey through life, it soon becomes evident that each generation born will turn to the previous one for guidancean act that strengthens the Dunniff family bond forever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Generations of Love is a compelling tale that follows three generations through love, loss, pain, sorrow, and joy as each family attempts to survive all of lifes challenges.&lt;/p&gt;" />
