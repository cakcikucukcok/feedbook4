  <title>Through Phantom Eyes - Theodora Bruns</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;This is the pivotal volume. In it, Erik faces challenges both new and frightening when he encounters Christine, the woman fate has directed to his lonely heart. Just as a river changes the landscape of a country, Christine changes the course of Eriks life.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;The year is 1881, and the lonely man, Erik enters a period in his life when his full passion finds its true home in the form of the young chorus girl, Christine. Once he meets her, his obsession for her is fueled by his past years of distressing solitude, and she becomes the woman he loves and the woman he must have as his own.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;His deformity is the first obstacle in the way if winning her love, but her childhood sweetheart, Raoul, is the bigger obstacle and the biggest challenge. He meets these challenges, while he also keeps his managers doing his will, which is to make Christines career a success. Erik works patiently to gain the trust and love of Christine, while, at the same time, he meets the challenge presented by Raouls youth and handsome appearance. Violent encounters are inevitable in any love triangle, but considering Eriks past life and deformed emotions, the encounters become death-dealing. &lt;/P&gt;" />
