  <title>The White Fence - Jacqueline White</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Tracy couldnt have imagined a worse start to her freshman year. The weekend before shes supposed to start school at the recently integrated Mason High in Bakersfield, Alabama, a fatal car accident threatens the fragile peace her town has experienced since it was forced to desegregate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe its an omen, but Tracy is determined not to let it slow her down. With segregation slowly dying across the South, she sees change happening and is determined to use it to her advantage. Tracy dreams of making it to Harvard, and she wont let anything stop her from becoming an Ivy Leaguetrained lawyer. Aware of the amount of dedication and personal sacrifice it will take to achieve this goal, she is willing to give up weekends out, and is prepared for her teachers, friends, and even family to stand in her way. What she hasnt counted on, however, is falling in love.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Derek doesnt know what he wants from the future. Lacking ambition, and happily settled in Bakersfield, the only thing the two of them seem to have in common is their dislike for each other. When a high school project forces them to work together, Tracy finds herself falling for him. But in her quest to achieve the impossible, theres no room for deviation or compromiseand theres certainly no room for love.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Tracy struggles with her developing feelings, she realizes that in life, its never as simple as black and white.&lt;/p&gt;" />
