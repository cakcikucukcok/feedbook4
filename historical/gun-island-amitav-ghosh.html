  <title>Gun Island - Amitav Ghosh</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Named a Best Book of Fall by &lt;i&gt;Vulture, Chicago Review of Books&lt;/i&gt; and Amazon&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;From the award-winning author of the bestselling epic Ibis trilogy comes a globetrotting, folkloric adventure novel about family and heritage&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Bundook. Gun. A common word, but one that turns Deen Datta&#39;s world upside down.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A dealer of rare books, Deen is used to a quiet life spent indoors, but as his once-solid beliefs begin to shift, he is forced to set out on an extraordinary journey; one that takes him from India to Los Angeles and Venice via a tangled route through the memories and experiences of those he meets along the way. There is Piya, a fellow Bengali-American who sets his journey in motion; Tipu, an entrepreneurial young man who opens Deen&#39;s eyes to the realities of growing up in today&#39;s world; Rafi, with his desperate attempt to help someone in need; and Cinta, an old friend who provides the missing link in the story they are all a part of. It is a journey that will upend everything he thought he knew about himself, about the Bengali legends of his childhood, and about the world around him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Amitav Ghosh&#39;s &lt;i&gt;Gun Island&lt;/i&gt; is a beautifully realized novel that effortlessly spans space and time. It is the story of a world on the brink, of increasing displacement and unstoppable transition. But it is also a story of hope, of a man whose faith in the world and the future is restored by two remarkable women.&lt;/p&gt;" />
