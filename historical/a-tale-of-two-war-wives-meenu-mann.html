  <title>A Tale of Two War Wives - Meenu Mann</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Set in a historical era of British Raj in India, a story of two womens struggles and sacrifices before, during and after the WW2.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Annie survives the trauma of neglect and abuse in her childhood but finds love in her husband Peter, an army officer who is sent to India under the imperial Raj to control the constant threats of mutinies erupting all over India during Quit India movements. After spending six years of their marriage in India, Annie loses Peter to a local woman who finds Peter half dead in the attack from the freedom fighters. Peter in the state of amnesia dont recognize Annie and chooses to be with his caretaker Miriam. Devastated and desolate Annie finds solace in Peters friend and fellow army officer Suraj who helps her through the ordeal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Surajs wife Maya who lives in a village with her two daughters and elderly in-laws desperately wants a son. Her attempts to have a son fail tragically when complications in pregnancy lead to hysterectomy. Fear of losing Surajs inheritance to his mean nephews for lack of male heir leaves Maya no option but to marry her husband off to another woman in a hope for a son. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Annie who has kept her son a secret from Suraj all her life, feels obligated to disclose this important information before Suraj dies. Maya is left to introduce Charlie to her daughters and son Veer (from the second wife) and honors Charlie to perform his fathers funeral rites. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mayas devotion to her husband and family intrigues Annie. The two remain friends forever. Ironically two brothers from different mothers meet on the same flight but are clueless that they are visiting the same dying father. &lt;/p&gt;" />
