  <title>The Tiger and the Hare - Jane Miller Chai</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The Tiger and the Hare offers an exciting and unusual take on Americas Vietnam adventure.  Author Jane Chai presents the thrilling story of a young American woman caught up in the seething intrigue of South Vietnam in the early days of 1962 and 1963, an absolutely critical period which set the stage---for better or worse---for the massive U.S. intervention that followed later. She fully captures the mood and flavor of that time.  She deftly weaves real-life events and personalities into the story, adding not only credibility but unique insight to her tale.  The book is in fact a masterful blend of fact and fiction, an important historical novel that for those of us who served there in those critical years is probably the only way the true story can be properly told. The Tiger and the Hare is a major contribution to that elusive understanding.
James Rosenthal, Political Officer at the U.S. Embassy in Saigon, 1961-1965.
The Tiger and the Hare goes a long way in illuminating how the U.S. became ensnared in a war in my country.  Skillfully told, a young American female scholars enchantment with the history and culture of Vietnam conflicts with the rigid aims of her own country.  This riveting tale of discovery describes two lunar years essential to understanding the subsequent years of war.
Nguyen Van Canh, University of Saigon Professor of Law and Politics; Author, Vietnam Under Communism, 1975-1982, Hoover Institution
Ms. Chai does an admirable job of evoking the issues and atmosphere of Vietnam in the early sixties.
