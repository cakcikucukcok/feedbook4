  <title>The Red-Tailed Devils - Paul V. Cozens</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The book is a historical fiction. This means that the characters are fictional as are their exploits, but the story line is based on historical fact. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hauptman Otto Kruger is assigned to a special Luftwaffe fighter group tasked with shooting down American bombers even if he must resort to ramming. In order to achieve this goal, he devises a number of innovative techniques, which include tethered bombs and eight-inch mortars. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lt. Vernon Ghest of the 302nd fighter squadron, while flying his war-weary P-51C Mustang with the distinctive red tail markings of the 332nd fighter group, becomes Ottos nemesis. When Vernon and another airman from the Ninety-Ninth FS are eventually forced down, they present the Germans with a new problem as they attempt to insert the black airman into the all-white POW camp. Eventually, Vernon and his companion devise and implement an ingenious escape plan that allows them to escape to once more to fight the Luftwaffe in the skies over Germany. &lt;/p&gt;" />
