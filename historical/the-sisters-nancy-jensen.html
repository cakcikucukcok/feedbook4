But on the day that Bertie receives her eighth-grade diploma, good intentions go terribly wrong. A choice made in desperate haste sets off a chain of misunderstandings that will divide the sisters and reverberate through three generations of women.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What happens when nothing turns out as you planned? From the Depression through World War II and Vietnam, and smaller events both tragic and joyful, Bertie and Mabel forge unexpected identities that are shaped by unspeakable secrets. As the sisters have daughters and granddaughters of their own, they discover that both love and betrayal are even more complicated than they seem.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gorgeously written, with extraordinary insight and emotional truth, Nancy Jensen&#39;s powerful debut novel illuminates the far-reaching power of family and family secrets.&lt;/p&gt;" />
