  <title>The Butcher&amp;#39;s Daughter - Victoria Glendinning</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;DIV&gt;In 1535, England is hardly a  wellspring of gender equality; it is a grim and oppressive age where women--even  the privileged few who can read and write--have little independence. In The Butcher&#39;s Daughter, it is this milieu that mandates Agnes  Peppin, daughter of a simple country butcher, to leave her family home in  disgrace and live out her days cloistered behind the walls of the Shaftesbury  Abbey. But with her great intellect, she becomes the assistant to the Abbess  and as a result integrates herself into the unstable royal landscape of King  Henry VIII.As  Agnes grapples with the complex rules and hierarchies of her new life, King  Henry VIII has proclaimed himself the new head of the Church. Religious houses  are being formally subjugated and monasteries dissolved, and the great Abbey is  no exception to the purge. The cosseted world in which Agnes has carved out for  herself a sliver of liberty is shattered. Now, free at last to be the master of  her own fate, she descends into a world she knows little about, using her wits  and testing her moral convictions against her need to survive by any means  necessary . . .The Butcher&#39;s Daughter is the riveting story of a young woman facing  head-on the obstacles carefully constructed against her sex. This dark and  affecting novel by award-winning author Victoria Glendinning intricately  depicts the lives of women in the sixteenth century in a world dominated by  men, perfect for fans of Wolf Hall and  Philippa Gregory.&lt;/DIV&gt;" />
