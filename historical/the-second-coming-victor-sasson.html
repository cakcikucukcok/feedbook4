  <title>The Second Coming - Victor Sasson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Jesus of Nazareths blasphemous statements, contradicting Gods Torah and the teachings of the Hebrew Prophets, had earned him a place in &lt;i&gt;Gehinnom.&lt;/i&gt; His scheme of a Second Coming to smite all those that do not worship him as son of God and mankinds saviour led him to a second trial  this time by a Heavenly Sanhedrin. An array of biblical and extra-biblical persons cross-examine him or testify in the case. These include Moses, Isaiah, Jeremiah, Ezekiel, Hosea, Joel, Amos, Zechariah, Micah, Obadiah, Daniel, Ezra the Scribe, a Pharisee and a Sadducee, Pontius Pilate, Joseph Caiaphas, the DSS Teacher of Righteousness, Paul of Tarsus, and the harbinger of the true Messiah  Elijah the Tishbite. With a powerful Attorney defending him in Court, will Jesus repent of his blasphemies and renounce his second coming, or will he choose to face further legal consequences?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Second Coming&lt;/i&gt; is a trial of Jesus of Nazareth conducted in the Heavenly Sphere and backed by &lt;i&gt;Adonai Elohim.&lt;/i&gt; A fast-moving courtroom drama, it will appeal to both biblical scholars and laymen alike.&lt;/p&gt;" />
