  <title>Heart Of Honor (Mills &amp; Boon M&amp;B) (The Heart Trilogy, Book 1) - Kat Martin</title>

        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;Krista Hart, publisher of the weekly London ladies&#39; gazette Heart to Heart, is not afraid to speak her mind.&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Even on such unpopular issues as social reform–risking her reputation and her very safety–Krista will not be intimidated, although she knows full well she is the target of angry opposition for her outspoken views. When she encounters a powerful Viking descendant imprisoned as a local sideshow attraction, Krista angrily demands his release.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Although she tells herself that freeing Leif Draugr is simply the right thing to do, she can&#39;t deny being attracted to the fierce Nordic chieftain, especially after her father transforms him into a &quot;proper&quot; English gentleman. But as anonymous threats against Krista become more and more aggressive, it is Leif who must face the unseen enemies desperate to silence her, even as they push her closer into the embrace of a warrior prepared to do whatever it takes to make her his.&lt;/p&gt;
