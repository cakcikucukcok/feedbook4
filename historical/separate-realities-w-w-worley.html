  <title>Separate Realities - W.W. Worley</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Ezekial Robertson went to war before he was old enough to shave. He fought and killed those he learned too late were not his enemies. Returning from the insane and confusing war, there was no family left for him at home in Carolina so he left for Texas in search of a cure for his chronic loneliness and unrelenting yearning. Along the way he met other pilgrims searching for their lives and through the miles and struggles they melded into a tight-knit family of misfits. Together they stood against bandits, reconstruction conditions, Comanche and Kiowa and built a home together in the Wild West Texas wilderness. Each member of this family of friends struggles with life and their own sorrows. Some were blessed to learn that sorrows cure was there beside them, in God-given friendship, as each lived through and toward their own separate reality.&lt;/p&gt;" />
