  <title>Eclipse - Richard S. Wheeler</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Lewis and Clark: forever paired for their epochal first crossing of the continent in 1804-1806, darlings of the young republic, and the pride of Thomas Jefferson because they made his dream of a nation between two oceans come true.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lewis and Clark: two great but very different men. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Plain-spoken William Clark, enjoys the triumphs and acclaim of the expedition, marries his childhood sweetheart, and settles in St. Louis as superintendent of the nation&#39;s Indian affairs. His black manservant, York, who accompanied the expedition, forces Clark to confront the very nature of slavery and question the society that condoned it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meriwether Lewis, a man of fierce courage and brilliant intellect, returns from the Pacific a changed man. Something terrible has happened to him, something insidious, a disease with no name that erodes his health, threatens to destroy his mind--and his honor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In &lt;i&gt;Eclipse&lt;/i&gt;, Richard S. Wheeler has written a tour de force novel, an exploration of triumph and tragedy told in the authentically rendered voices of the two greatest American explorers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Moreover, Wheeler provides a solution--dark in its ramifications--to one of the greatest mysteries in American history: the terrible and unexplained death of Meriwether Lewis, age thirty-five, in the wilderness of the Natchez Trace of Tennessee in October, 1809.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the Publisher&#39;s request, this title is being sold without Digital Rights Management Software (DRM) applied.&lt;/p&gt;" />
