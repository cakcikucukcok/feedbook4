There were a score round us when the fool, little knowing the man with whom he had to deal, and as little how to lose like a gentleman, flung the words in my teeth. He thought, I&amp;#39;ll be sworn, that I should storm and swear and ruffle it like any common cock of the hackle. But that was never Gil de Berault&amp;#39;s way. For a few seconds after he had spoken I did not even look at him. I passed my eye instead&amp;mdash;smiling, BIEN ENTENDU&amp;mdash;round the ring of waiting faces, saw that there was no one except De Pombal I had cause to fear; and then at last I rose and looked at the fool with the grim face I have known impose on older and wiser men.&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;#39;Marked cards, M. l&amp;#39;Anglais?&amp;#39; I said, with a chilling sneer. &amp;#39;They are used, I am told, to trap players&amp;mdash;not unbirched schoolboys.&amp;#39;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;#39;Yet I say that they are marked!&amp;#39; he replied hotly, in his queer foreign jargon. &amp;#39;In my last hand I had nothing. You doubled the stakes. Bah, sir, you knew! You have swindled me!&amp;#39;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;#39;Monsieur is easy to swindle&amp;mdash;when he plays with a mirror behind him,&amp;#39; I answered tartly.&lt;br /&gt;
At that there was a great roar of laughter, which might have been heard in the street, and which brought to the table everyone in the eating-house whom his voice had not already attracted. But I did not relax my face. I waited until all was quiet again, and then waving aside two or three who stood between us and the entrance, I pointed gravely to the door..." />
