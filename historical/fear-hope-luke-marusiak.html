  <title>Fear &amp; Hope - Luke Marusiak</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The collapse of the steel industry in the 1970s hit Western Pennsylvania hard. Hundreds of thousands lost their livelihoods, population sank, schools closed, and despair ruled many. In the midst of these trials, the destinies of three who came of age during that timePhilip Bennet, Liam Conti, and Ruth OBrienwere determined by the choice they made: that of fear or that of hope. As the three grapple with their situation and their yearning for significance, they discover their fight is part of a much larger struggle. 
Excerpt from the prefaceBarack Obama referring to Pennsylvanians, April 2008: 
Its not surprising then that they get bitter, they cling to guns or religion or antipathy to people who arent like them . . .  
That characterization is so far from the truth; an answer is in order. Fear &amp; Hope is intended to be that answer. This novel is meant, first of all, to entertain because the Western Pennsylvania tragedies and triumphs are one heck of story. But it is also, in some small measure, meant to both rebuff Mr. Obamas pompous marginalization and point out the cautionary tales of high-cost mistakes made then that are being repeated today.
This novel is part of the Good Fight Series and overlaps times and characters of Marx &amp; Ford, Loud &amp; Clear, and the upcoming Gold &amp; Glory." />
