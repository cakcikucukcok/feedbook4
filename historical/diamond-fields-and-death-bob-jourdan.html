  <title>Diamond Fields and Death - Bob Jourdan</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;When Jim Keaton learns that his brother Billy has died and has left him an inheritance, Jim leaves his home in Del Rio, Texas, a sleepy border town along the Rio Grande River, and travels to Denver. He hears about his brothers dealings with the diamond fields and sets out to investigate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jim finds himself settling into the corner where Colorado, Utah, and Wyoming meet. While looking for the diamond field, he runs into hardheaded Ed Cole, a man set in his ways who uses public ground for sheep grazing. Befriending Cole places Jim in the middle of a nasty range dispute that could become deadly at any moment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Suspicion arises when Jim recognizes Tom Horn, a former Indian scout but now a range detective with a reputation for eliminating rustlers without a trial. Horn is working on Cold Spring Mountain masquerading as a man named James Hicks. When men start dying, blame is placed on Horn. Only Jim knows the truth, and hes not sure he can or wants to handle that burden.&lt;/p&gt;" />
