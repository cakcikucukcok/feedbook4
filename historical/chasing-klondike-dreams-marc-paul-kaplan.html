  <title>Chasing Klondike Dreams - Marc Paul Kaplan</title>
      <meta name="description" content="It is 1897 as a disillusioned Jared Monroe rebels against the life chosen for him and leaves Yale Divinity School. After he is violently rejected by his family, he embarks on a journey with his dog to forge a new life and regain self-respect.
Maggie Saunders is a high-class prostitute who has just been condemned after defending herself against a wealthy customer. With no hope for justice, she escapes St. Louis in search of safety and a decent life. Alex Stromberg, the ruthless son of a wealthy merchant, is trapped by his domineering father and a shadowy past. After a series of impulsive violent acts, he flees San Francisco hoping to be free of danger and his unforgiving father. As the three lost souls ultimately converge amid the chaotic Klondike Gold Rush in Skagway, each is transformed by brutality and greed while risking everything to survive in the desolate wilderness and attain wealth, freedom, and salvation. But none have any idea that fate has other plans for all of them.
In this historical novel, three lost souls must run for their lives as they attempt to rise above the crest of the Alaskan Stampede during the Klondike Gold Rush of 1897.
Not since Jack London has there been such a literacy and spiritual connection to wilderness and mans best friend.
Charlotte Cook, former publisher and story editor
Kaplan brings three lost souls together in a way that keeps the reader spellbound
