  <title>The Housemaid&#39;s Daughter - Barbara Mutch</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Barbara Mutch&#39;s stunning first novel tells a story of love and duty colliding on the arid plains of Apartheid-era South Africa&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Cathleen Harrington leaves her home in Ireland in 1919 to travel to South Africa, she knows that she does not love the man she is to marry there --her fiance Edward, whom she has not seen for five years. Isolated and estranged in a small town in the harsh Karoo desert, her only real companions are her diary and her housemaid, and later the housemaid&#39;s daughter, Ada. When Ada is born, Cathleen recognizes in her someone she can love and respond to in a way that she cannot with her own family.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Under Cathleen&#39;s tutelage, Ada grows into an accomplished pianist and a reader who cannot resist turning the pages of the diary, discovering the secrets Cathleen sought to hide. As they grow closer, Ada sees new possibilities in front of her--a new horizon. But in one night, everything changes, and Cathleen comes home from a trip to find that Ada has disappeared, scorned by her own community. Cathleen must make a choice: should she conform to society, or search for the girl who has become closer to her than her own daughter?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Set against the backdrop of a beautiful, yet divided land, &lt;i&gt;The Housemaid&#39;s Daughter &lt;/i&gt;is a startling and thought-provoking novel that intricately portrays the drama and heartbreak of two women who rise above cruelty to find love, hope, and redemption.&lt;/p&gt;" />
