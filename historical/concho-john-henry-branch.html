  <title>Concho - John Henry Branch</title>
      <meta name="description" content="A treacherous journey through the Wyoming wilderness brings great change and challenge to Jamis Johnson and his frontier family. His dream is to create a quality strain of horses for the demanding life of the expanding American frontier. His dream can become a reality with the purchase of a stallion from the stock of George Gray of the G Bar G Ranch in Laramie. Jamis leaves his family to trek through the foothills of the Rattlesnake Mountains, where he encounters Indians and battles the unforgiving elements of the rugged outdoors to reach Laramie before winter sets in. In his absence, his wife, Deborah, is left with the insurmountable endeavor of trying to provide for herself and her young son in a cold, cruel and dangerous environment.
Their struggle to survive through astonishing circumstances will draw the reader into their world and provide a glimpse into what life was like for those American heroes who settled this great country and helped it to become a beacon to the downtrodden from the far corners of the earth." />
