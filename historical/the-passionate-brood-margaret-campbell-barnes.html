  <title>The Passionate Brood - Margaret Campbell Barnes</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;A Spirited Retelling of King Richard the Lionheart and the Third Crusade&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&quot;Margaret Campbell Barnes has been one of the most reliable of England&#39;s historical novelists.&quot;&lt;br&gt; &lt;i&gt;-Chicago Tribune&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In this compelling novel of love, loyalty, and lost chances, Margaret Campbell Barnes gives readers a new perspective on Richard the Lionheart&#39;s triumphs and tragedies. Drawing on folklore, Barnes explores what might have happened if King Richard&#39;s foster brother were none other than Robin Hood, a legendary figure more vibrant than most in authentic history. Thick as thieves as Richard builds a kingdom and marshals a crusade, the two clash when Robin Hood so provokes the king&#39;s white hot temper that Richard banishes him. &lt;i&gt;The Passionate Brood &lt;/i&gt;is a tale of a man driven to win back the Holy Land, beset by the guilt of casting out his childhood friend, and shouldering the burden of being the lionhearted leader of the Plantagenets.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;u&gt;Praise for Margaret Campbell Barnes&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&quot;Barnes vividly depicts Anne&#39;s hopes and fears in an age where royal marriages were brokered like a cattle fair, and beheading could befall even a Queen.&quot;&lt;br&gt; &lt;i&gt;-Publishers Weekly &lt;/i&gt;on &lt;i&gt;Brief Gaudy Hour&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&quot;Rich in detail and flows beautifully, letting readers escape into Anne&#39;s court and country life.
