  <title>Wade (Mills &amp; Boon M&amp;B) (Louisiana Gentlemen, Book 5) - Jennifer Blake</title>
      <meta name="description" content="
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;Wade Benedict has a job to do: infiltrate a treacherous land and rescue Chloe Madison.&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;It was her father&#39;s dying wish–and Wade is taking it personally. The problem is, this stubborn, angry and courageous woman doesn&#39;t want to be saved. Her rage at the oppressive treatment of women has pulled Chloe into the dangerous world of an underground rebellion. She can&#39;t desert the women with whom she forged a daring alliance, and this self-appointed rescuer can&#39;t force her to abandon her friends or her commitments–even though her own life is at stake.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;But Chloe has met her match in Wade, a man as honorable and determined as she. As they make their escape through the treacherous mountains, unspoken passion wears away at the sharp edges that guard their hearts. And when deadly danger stalks them in Turn-Coupe, Louisiana, together they must face a battle that can only be won by the indomitable will of family…and of love.&lt;/p&gt;
