  <title>The Midnight Watch - David Dyer</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;As the &lt;i&gt;Titanic&lt;/i&gt; and her passengers sank slowly into the Atlantic  Ocean after striking an iceberg late in the evening of April 14, 1912, a  nearby ship looked on. Second Officer Herbert Stone, in charge of the  midnight watch on the &lt;i&gt;SS Californian&lt;/i&gt; sitting idly a few miles north, saw the distress rockets that the &lt;i&gt;Titanic&lt;/i&gt;  fired. He alerted the captain, Stanley Lord, who was sleeping in the  chartroom below, but Lord did not come to the bridge. Eight rockets were  fired during the dark hours of the midnight watch, and eight rockets  were ignored. The next morning, the &lt;i&gt;Titanic&lt;/i&gt; was at the bottom of  the sea and more than 1,500 people were dead. When they learned of the  extent of the tragedy, Lord and Stone did everything they could to hide  their role in the disaster, but pursued by newspapermen, lawyers, and  political leaders in America and England, their terrible secret was  eventually revealed. &lt;i&gt;The Midnight Watch&lt;/i&gt; is a fictional telling of what may have occurred that night on the &lt;i&gt;SS Californian&lt;/i&gt;, and the resulting desperation of Officer Stone and Captain Lord in the aftermath of their inaction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Told not only from the perspective of the &lt;i&gt;SS Californian&lt;/i&gt;  crew, but also through the eyes of a family of third-class passengers  who perished in the disaster, the narrative is drawn together by  Steadman, a tenacious Boston journalist who does not rest until the  truth is found. David Dyer&#39;s &lt;i&gt;The Midnight Watch&lt;/i&gt; is a powerful and  dramatic debut novel--the result of many years of research in  Liverpool, London, New York, and Boston, and informed by the author&#39;s  own experiences as a ship&#39;s officer and a lawyer.&lt;/p&gt;" />
