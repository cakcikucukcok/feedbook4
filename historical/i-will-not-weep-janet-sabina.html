     When my young protagonist is unable to protect his mother and newborn brother as he promised his father he would, I want readers to fight tears as he promises himself, I will not weep.  When he lies beside a meager fire suffering from small pox and wondering what death is like, I want readers to wonder too. &lt;br&gt;
      I want them to feel the humiliation of a young girl who has been sold as a slave when her owner rips a dress from her body.  When she escapes with a young man of her people and builds a marriage ceremony with what she remembers from home, I want readers to celebrate with her." />
