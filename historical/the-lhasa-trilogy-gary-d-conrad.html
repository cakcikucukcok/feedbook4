  <title>The Lhasa Trilogy - Gary D. Conrad</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Winner of both the New Age and Visionary categories of the 2012 International Book Awards competition. The Lhasa Trilogy is debut, character-driven, New Age historical fiction. Set in rural Oklahoma, Iwo Jima, Japan, Tibet and India.  On a frigid night at Tibet&#39;s Drepung Monastery, Lama Tenzin Tashi is awakened by a fervent knocking on his door. Quickly he realizes these raps are a dreaded harbinger, one which will launch him on a quest to satisfy a vow, a blasphemous promise he wishes he had never made. 	But at this point, the lama has no other choice. The journey must be undertaken, no matter the cost. 	Thus begins an odyssey that spans not only his life, but also the life of a man born near the small town of Davidson, Oklahoma. Who could comprehend how inexplicably intertwined their pathways would become as they pushed aside the veil that concealed the hidden secrets of death?" />
