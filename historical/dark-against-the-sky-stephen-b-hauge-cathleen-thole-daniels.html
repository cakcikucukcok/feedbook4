  <title>Dark Against the Sky - Stephen B. Hauge, Cathleen Thole-Daniels</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Dark Against the Sky:  Sweeping the Shadows continues the tale of Tommy Simpson, a climbing boy (or your chimney sweep) in the streets of London in 1834, that began in Dark Against the Sky:  A Climbing Boys Story.
	Tommy has been re-united with his father, who is working again as a cobbler while Tommy helps his costermonger friends, the Meechams.  Yet the shadow of the master sweep Kelly looms over their lives.
	When Kelly decides to rob Dr. Merriweather, he gets Tommy and his street friends to trail Kelly to his hide-out  but they cannot find the silver.  As Kelly threatens Tommy by seizing his friend Peter and his girlfriend Jenny, Tommy must use all his skills to rescue them and put Kelly in gaol.
	Author Hauge again displays the sweep of adventure, range of characters and sure sense of period that enabled Dark Against the Sky:  A Climbing Boys Story to deliver such enjoyment:
	This endearing story details the adventures of Tommy Simpson and his winsome and supportive band of brothers . . .  the action scenes and descriptions are nicely blended, and the entire book has a smooth cadence. . . .  The language used to describe these scenes chimes with bell-like accuracy and vivid images. . . . All ages will become entranced by this fast-paced historical tale.       Foreword Reviews
Hauge is a skillful storyteller.  He renders the squalor of 19th century London in prose that is as precise as it is palpable. . . .  Dark Against the Sky is an authentic, evocative and classic portrayal of the human capacity to endure.  It is a winning tale.        Blueink review" />
