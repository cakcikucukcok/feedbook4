  <title>The Concubine And The Witch - Olga Kryuchkova</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Japan, the end of the XVI century. The Azuchi Castle, which belongs to the feudal lord Oda Nobunaga, is preparing for the holiday. Hitomi, the youngest daughter of the feudal lord, turns twelve years old. Nobunaga intends to celebrate the adult age of his daughter with all his might and to settle lives of both the youngest daughter and the elder Yuriko (born from a concubine). The celebration is no slouch. A young feudal lord is assigned to become the husband of Hitomi, and the son of the judge for Yuriko. But the young beauties are not happy with the decision of their father.&lt;br/&gt;
Hitomi is consumed with desire for samurai Moronobu, who serves her father. Yuriko is by no means tempted to become the wife of the capital&#39;s judge. She raves about wealth and power.   &lt;br/&gt;
The feudal lord enjoys the mercy of young Emperor Gendji and his mother, the widowed beauty Aoyagi, with whom he once had a love affair. The feudal lord meets with Aoyagi again; they spend unforgettable days in a remote monastery. The widowed Empress gives the feudal lord two concubines, who turn out to be ninjas in reality. That is how Aoyagi hopes to protect the feudal lord from a possible assassination attempt. &lt;br/&gt;
The shogun dreams of destroying the clan of Oda Nobunaga, overthrow Genji and take the throne. He destroys or buys the Oda&#39;s allies to achieve his goal. The feudal lord loses allies thick and fast. Finally, the shogun decides to crush the disobedient feudal lord and offers him to marry Hitomi off to his son. Young beauties do not suspect that soon their lives will change abruptly. One of the sisters is destined to become a concubine, and another – a mountain witch. &lt;br/&gt;" />
