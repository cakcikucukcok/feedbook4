  <title>The Marines of Autumn - James Brady</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;War has been the inspiration of such great novels as &lt;i&gt;The Red Badge of Courage&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;A Farewell to Arms&lt;/i&gt;, and daring feats of courage and tragic mistakes have been the foundation for such classic works.  Now, for the first time ever, the Korean War has a novel that captures that courage and sacrifice. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Captain Thomas Verity, USMC, is called back to action, he must leave his Georgetown home, career, and young daughter and rush to Korea to monitor Chinese radio transmissions.  At first acting in an advisory role, he is abruptly thrust into MacArthur&#39;s last daring and disastrous foray-the Chosin Reservoir campaign-and then its desperate retreat. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Time magazine at the time recounted the retreat this way: &quot;The running fight of the Marines...was a battle unparalleled in U.S. military history.  It had some aspects of Bataan, some of Anzio, some of Dunkirk, some of Valley Forge, and some of &#39;the retreat of the 10,000&#39; as described in Xenophon&#39;s &lt;i&gt;Anabasis&lt;/i&gt;.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Marines of Autumn&lt;/i&gt; is a stunning, shattering novel of war illuminated only by courage, determination, and Marine Corps discipline.  And by love: of soldier for soldier, of men and their women, and of a small girl in Georgetown, whose father promised she would dance with him on the bridges of Paris. A child Captain Tom Verity fears he may never see again. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In &lt;i&gt;The Marines of Autumn&lt;/i&gt;, James Brady captures our imagination and shocks us into a new understanding of war.&lt;/p&gt;" />
