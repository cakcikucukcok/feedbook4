  <title>In Danger Every Hour - Charles Causey</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;I&gt; In Danger Every Hour&lt;/I&gt; is a swift, incisive story of the intensity of the Civil War in the year 1862.  During the year that preceded Gettysburg, the 
costliest fighting ever known to man is seen on the fields of Manassas and Antietam.  Hand-to-hand combat was the rule.  Both sides determined to end the 
war quickly.  Both sides hastily entered into battle.  These fierce and bloody contests resulted in a devastating amount of lost lives.  This landmark 
account will at times leave you speechless, angry and sad.  In Danger Every Hour is a swift, incisive story of how Abraham Lincoln, Stonewall Jackson, 
George McClellan and the common infantryman are caught up into a brutal conflict where 600,000 men would sacrifice their lives.  It also peers into the 
lives of the women and children who endured the repeated hostilities sweeping through Virginian towns that year.  This gripping saga comes to an epic 
conclusion when all the betrayals are exposed and the mysterious agents revealed.  An action-packed thriller filled with romance and adventure, the very 
essence of each characters faith and friendships are tested as their journey leads them to the brink of human endurance over and over again.
&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/BR&gt;
&lt;CENTER&gt;&lt;b&gt;A novel of innocence, bravery and misfortune, In Danger Every Hour delivers to the reader an absorbing tale of how war-torn people cling to the 
power of love and forgiveness.&lt;/CENTER&gt;&lt;/b&gt;" />
