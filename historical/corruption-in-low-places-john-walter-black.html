  <title>Corruption in Low Places - John Walter Black</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The old Western town of Greenwood is the last place to expect trouble. Corruption is the sort of mess only found in the national government or in big cities. In a corner of the world where everyone knows everyone else, families live and do business in peace. But when one honest, successful entrepreneur tries to expand his endeavors, he collides head-on with a malignant political machine designed for its own profit, draining wealth from the innocent, unsuspecting city like a leech. It has his fellow businessmen trapped, paying through the nose just to keep the corrupt officials appeased, while their community crumbles under a crooked police force. The rest of his friends are running scared, but his stubborn sense of justice will not let him back down. Time will tell if that stubbornness will save the city, or ruin him and his family." />
