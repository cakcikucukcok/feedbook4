  <title>West to Big Water - Garry Camp Burdick</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This is a story of three men wounded by a civil war between the states the years after the wars end. We ride with them from Connecticut to San Francisco California, a path of dangerous undertaking by able men who have the qualifications and skills to do things well. Their loyal horses are the mode of transportation on this long journey and play an important roll. They have hand guns on the hip and rifles in the long leather case beside their saddles. The weapons are in place to defend and hunt, not for intentional killing. 
During the ride west they meet soldiers from their old units. The three have had many years in the service for the North. From Bull Run to wars end and onto the fighting at Yellow river in the west. The mens journey, Sergeant Target, Garth, and J.T., made news, saved lives, and drove respect into the hearts of the confederate soldier and Indian warrior. 
Their sleep was fitful, for their senses were ever keen to the sounds of the night. Like mountain cats they were ready to spring into action at the slightest motion or unusual noise." />
