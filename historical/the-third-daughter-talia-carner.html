      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;#8220;In &lt;em&gt;The Third Daughter&lt;/em&gt;, Talia Carner ably illuminates a little-known piece of history: the sex trafficking of young women from Russia to South America in the late 19th century. Thoroughly researched and vividly rendered, this is an important and unforgettable story of exploitation and empowerment that will leave you both shaken and inspired.&amp;#8221;&amp;#160;&amp;#8212;Pam Jenoff, &lt;em&gt;New York Times &lt;/em&gt;bestselling author of &lt;em&gt;The Lost Girls of Paris&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The turn of the 20th century finds&amp;#160;fourteen-year-old Batya in the Russian countryside, fleeing with her family endless pogroms. Desperate, her father&amp;#160;leaps at the opportunity to marry Batya to a&amp;#160;worldly, wealthy stranger who can guarantee his daughter an easy life and passage&amp;#160;to America. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Feeling like a princess in a fairytale, Batya leaves her old life behind as she is whisked away to a new world.&amp;#160;But soon she discovers that she&amp;#8217;s entered a waking nightmare.&amp;#160;Her new &amp;#8220;husband&amp;#8221; does indeed bring her to America: Buenos Aires, a vibrant, growing city in which prostitution is not only legal but deeply embedded in the culture. And now Batya is one of thousands of women tricked and sold into a brothel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the years pass, Batya forms deep bonds with her &amp;#8220;sisters&amp;#8221; in the house as well as some men who are both kind and cruel.&amp;#160;Through it all, she&amp;#160;holds onto one dream: to bring her family to America, where they will be safe from the anti-Semitism that plagues Russia. Just as Batya is becoming a known tango dancer, &amp;#160;she gets an unexpected but dangerous opportunity&amp;#8212;to help bring down the criminal&amp;#160;network that has enslaved so many young women and has been instrumental in developing Buenos Aires into &amp;#160;&amp;#160;a major metropolis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A powerful story of finding courage in the face of danger, and hope in the face of despair, &lt;em&gt;The Third Daughter&lt;/em&gt; brings to life a dark period of Jewish history and gives a voice to victims whose truth deserves to finally be told.&lt;/p&gt;" />
