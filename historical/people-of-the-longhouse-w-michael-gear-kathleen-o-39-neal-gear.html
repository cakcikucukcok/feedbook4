  <title>People of the Longhouse - W. Michael Gear, Kathleen O&#39;Neal Gear</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Six hundred years ago in what would become the northeastern United States and southeastern Canada, five Iroquois tribes were locked in bitter warfare. From the ashes of violence, a great Peacemaker was born...&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Young Odion and his little sister, Tutelo, live in fear that one day Yellowtail Village will be attacked. When that day comes and Odion and Tutelo are marched away as slaves, their only hope is that their parents will rescue them. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their mother, War Chief Koracoo, and their father, Deputy Gonda, think they are tracking an ordinary war party herding captive children to an enemy village. Koracoo and Gonda do not know that Odion and Tutelo have fallen into the hands of a legendary evil: Gannajero the Trader. Known as the Crow, she is a figure out of nightmare, a witch who captures children for her own nefarious purposes. No one can stand against her powers--except perhaps the mysterious Forest Spirit whose tracks have crisscrossed their own throughout their journey.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Odion and the other children struggle to survive their brutal captivity. They, too, have seen the Forest Spirit. But like their parents, they can&#39;t be sure if the Spirit is a friend--or is in league with Gannajero....&lt;br&gt;In&lt;i&gt; People of the Longhouse&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;New York Times &lt;/i&gt;and &lt;i&gt;USA Today &lt;/i&gt;bestselling authors W. Michael Gear and Kathleen O&#39;Neal Gear continue the gripping saga of North America&#39;s Forgotten Past.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the Publisher&#39;s request, this title is being sold without Digital Rights Management Software (DRM) applied.&lt;/p&gt;" />
