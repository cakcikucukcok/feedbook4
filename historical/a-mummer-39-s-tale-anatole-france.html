  <title>A Mummer&#39;s Tale - Anatole France</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The scene was an actress&amp;#39;s dressing-room at the Od&amp;eacute;on. F&amp;eacute;licie Nanteuil, her hair powdered, with blue on her eyelids, rouge on her cheeks and ears, and white on her neck and shoulders, was holding out her foot to Madame Michon, the dresser, who was fitting on a pair of little black slippers with red heels. Dr. Trublet, the physician attached to the theatre, and a friend of the actress&amp;#39;s, was resting his bald cranium on a cushion of the divan, his hands folded upon his stomach and his short legs crossed.&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;What else, my dear?&amp;quot; he inquired of her.&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Oh, I don&amp;#39;t know! Fits of suffocation; giddiness; and, all of a sudden, an agonizing pain, as if I were going to die. That&amp;#39;s the worst of all.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Do you sometimes feel as though you must laugh or cry for no apparent reason, about nothing at all?&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;That I cannot tell you, for in this life one has so many reasons for laughing or crying!&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Are you subject to attacks of dizziness?&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;No. But, just think, doctor, at night, I see an imaginary cat, under the chairs or the table, gazing at me with fiery eyes!&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Try not to dream of cats any more,&amp;quot; said Madame Michon, &amp;quot;because that&amp;#39;s a bad omen. To see a cat is a sign that you&amp;#39;ll be betrayed by friends, or deceived by a woman.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;But it is not in my dreams that I see a cat! It&amp;#39;s when I&amp;#39;m wide awake!&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
Trublet, who was in attendance at the Od&amp;eacute;on once a month only, was given to looking in as a friend almost every evening. He was fond of the actresses, delighted in chatting with them, gave them good advice, and listened with delicacy to their confidences. He promised F&amp;eacute;licie that he would write her a prescription at once..." />
