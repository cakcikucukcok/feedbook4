  <title>The Last City Room - Al Martinez</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Set in San Francisco in the 1960s, &lt;i&gt;The Last City Room&lt;/i&gt; chronicles the conflict that erupts, ideologically and physically, between the old guard of an aging city newspaper and the ascendant Berkeley radicals determined to be heard at any cost.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s almost a tradition in the city room of &lt;i&gt;The Herald&lt;/i&gt; for journalists to collapse at their desks, having worked, imbibed, and smoked themselves into the grave. On these occasions the behavior required by the dead man&#39;s erstwhile colleagues - a group of cynical old news hounds with skin the color of faded newsprint - is to applaud, simultaneously hailing their fallen comrade and signaling an opening in the city room. It is in this manner that William Colfax, an ambitious young reporter, earns a coveted position as a staff member of this long-respected newspaper. Colfax accepts the offer mere minutes after his predecessor&#39;s body has been carted away. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Last City Room&lt;/i&gt; depicts the decline of an influential newspaper in San Francisco during the turbulent early 60s. As the conservatism of the old guard, led by &lt;i&gt;The Herald&lt;/i&gt;&#39;s publisher and his bylined minions, clashes with the radical leaders ascending to power in the city, Colfax quickly realizes that the golden days of &lt;i&gt;The Herald &lt;/i&gt;are long over. With his past threatening to ensnare him between the two warring factions, Colfax&#39;s struggle quickly becomes one of not simply proving himself as a reporter, but of maintaining his independence and integrity as a journalist.&lt;/p&gt;" />
