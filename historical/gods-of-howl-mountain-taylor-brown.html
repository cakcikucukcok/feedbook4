  <title>Gods of Howl Mountain - Taylor Brown</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&quot;A fresh, authentic, and eloquent new voice in American fiction.&quot; - Robert Morgan, &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author of&lt;i&gt; Gap Creek&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;In &lt;i&gt;Gods of Howl Mountain, &lt;/i&gt;award-winning author Taylor Brown explores a world of folk healers, whiskey-runners, and dark family secrets in the high country of 1950s North Carolina.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bootlegger Rory Docherty has returned home to the fabled mountain of his childhood - a misty wilderness that holds its secrets close and keeps the outside world at gunpoint. Slowed by a wooden leg and haunted by memories of the Korean War, Rory runs bootleg whiskey for a powerful mountain clan in a retro-fitted &#39;40 Ford coupe. Between deliveries to roadhouses, brothels, and private clients, he lives with his formidable grandmother, evades federal agents, and stokes the wrath of a rival runner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the mill town at the foot of the mountains - a hotbed of violence, moonshine, and the burgeoning sport of stock-car racing - Rory is bewitched by the mysterious daughter of a snake-handling preacher. His grandmother, Maybelline &quot;Granny May&quot; Docherty, opposes this match for her own reasons, believing that &quot;some things are best left buried.&quot; A folk healer whose powers are rumored to rival those of a wood witch, she concocts potions and cures for the people of the mountains while harboring an explosive secret about Rory&#39;s mother - the truth behind her long confinement in a mental hospital, during which time she has not spoken one word. When Rory&#39;s life is threatened, Granny must decide whether to reveal what she knows...or protect her only grandson from the past.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With gritty and atmospheric prose, Taylor Brown brings to life a perilous mountain and the family who rules it.&lt;/p&gt;" />
