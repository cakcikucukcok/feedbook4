  <title>The Sweet Hills of Florence - Jan Wallace Dickinson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="All Souls&#39; Day - the Day of the Dead, 1941. Florence, city of strife. It is Hitler&#39;s state visit to Florence and the last of the good times for Mussolini. From now on, he and his lover Clara will cling more closely together, ever more dependent upon each other as their country spirals into civil war and their lives disintegrate.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Annabelle and Enrico, young cousins from an ancient Florentine family, work first with the clandestine resistance, then openly with the partisans. Facing life and death together in the mountains, they forge a passionate life-long bond.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;How reliable is memory and can we ever expiate past sins? Are some ghosts better left alone?&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&#39;The Sweet Hills of Florence &lt;i&gt;is a sweeping novel spanning time and distance between Italy and Australia, between Mussolini&#39;s Italy and that of Berlusconi, between past and present. It is a rich tapestry woven with skilful insight, of the culture and the times. In digging beneath the patina of memory in a search for meaning, it opens doors to the past and raises uncomfortable questions for the present.&#39;&lt;/i&gt; - Sandy McCutcheon, author of &lt;i&gt;Black Widow&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&#39;I loved how this story brought the contrast of Australia and Italy to life. This is a book that digs deep, as Jan Wallace Dickinson explores the bonds that define us and shape our lives.&#39; - Lisa Clifford, author of &lt;i&gt;The Promise&lt;/i&gt;" />
