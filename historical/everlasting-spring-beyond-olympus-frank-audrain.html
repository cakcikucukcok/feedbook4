  <title>Everlasting Spring: Beyond Olympus - Frank Audrain</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;It is first-century Brittania as Christianity begins its rise in a pagan world. As a man and woman meet as enemies, they have only one thing in common: the Romans are dominating each of their respective homelands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Benjamin is an Israelite whose wife was murdered by Roman soldiers while on the annual Passover journey. Although Benjamin is rich in material terms, he has lost the spiritual comfort he once sought through Judaism. Now as he attempts to escape Roman tyranny, he is searching for a purpose he hopes will restore his desire to continue living in a world gone mad. Boudica is also doing her best to emerge from the darkness surrounding her plight. Now that her husband has died, the Queen of the Iceni Celts in Britton is dedicated to freeing her people from Roman imperialism. When fate guides the two adversaries to meet, their undeniable connection propels them forward into adventures, battles, betrayal, and a transcendent love that eventually sets into motion a series of events that will reveal the reason for their existence.&lt;br /&gt;
In this historical saga, a Jewish man and Celtic woman embark on a journey to find peace during a time of great upheaval as evil spreads, causing dire consequences for the Liberty of millions in generations that follow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A completely engaging story both emotionally and intellectually &lt;br /&gt;
Tom Hyman, former magazine and book editor and author of six novels&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Praise for the debut volume of The Everlasting Spring: Beyond Olympus&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Everlasting Spring: Beyond OlympusBook One, Benjamin and Boudicastrikes me as a winner with wide appeal. Its a completely engaging story both emotionally and intellectually, and certainly a rousing one in terms of level of action. The principal characters are vivid and compelling creations that will stick in a readers mind for a long time; the supporting cast is also first-rate. The prose is consistently lively and evocative, and sometimes quite eloquent. The storys themethe rise of Christianity following Christs crucifixion in the twilight years of the Roman Empireis powerfully articulated and presented. The plot is amazingly inventive and powerfully imagined. It is also solidly thought out and put together; the story arc is excellent, bringing the rising conflicts of the whole extraordinary adventure to a thunderous climax and resolutionand a very satisfying conclusion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tom Hyman is a professional novelist of twenty-five years standing with six novels in print in over a dozen languages (Jupiters Daughter, Prussian Blue, Seven Days to Petrograd, Riches and Honor, The Russian Woman, and Giant Killer). Tom is also a former magazine and book editor. In his years of editorial experience at LIFE Magazine and the publishing houses of Atheneum, Doubleday, and G.P. Putnams, he has worked with the widest of talents, including a substantial number of best-selling authors, academics, historians and novelists.&lt;/p&gt;" />
