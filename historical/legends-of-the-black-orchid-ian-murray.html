  <title>Legends of the Black Orchid - Ian Murray</title>
      <meta name="description" content="In the spring of 1914, two college friends, Thomas Tiggy McStuart and Hans von Gotha, one British and the other German, find themselves on opposite sides of the impending war. Tiggys dream of becoming a barrister and Hans plan to receive his doctorate are quickly fading. As Hans leaves for Germany after being conscripted, he realizes their friendship might never be the same.
Tiggy, feeling compelled to defend the crown, joins the London Light Infantry where he excels as a sniper in World War I and is eventually captured by the Germans. Meanwhile, Hans completes express doctorate training and is sent to serve at a field hospital in France. The lives of the two friends reconnect in a way neither of them thought possible.
Based on real-life events, Legends of the Black Orchid follows Tiggy and Hans through World War I and the start of World War II. It depicts how circumstances and the influences of the Black Orchid, a society formed by the royal families of Europe, bring them together as one, ultimately making them part of an exclusive intelligence unit that becomes the platform on which the British and American governments form a cooperative base for espionage." />
