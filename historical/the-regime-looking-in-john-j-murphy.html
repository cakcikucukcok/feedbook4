  <title>The Regime- Looking In - John J. Murphy</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Stephen Hawking wrote a book a Brief History of Time, and in a sense,
this is what this book is all about, a brief history or slice out of the Afrikaner
peoples existence in Southern Africa. A glimpse of their achievements,
their failures and disappointments, not through the eyes of an historian
but through entering into their lives, their homes, experiencing their pain,
laughing at their idiosyncrasies, walking next to them in their everyday
experiences at home, at work, at war and at play. After some deliberation
it was decided that the best way to achieve this goal would be by using
the medium of short stories, and to concentrate on the time period 1930
to 2000. It is felt that future historians will recognize this period as the
most dramatic and signifi cant in the rise and fall of the Afrikaner nation
as well as the birth of the so called rainbow nation." />
