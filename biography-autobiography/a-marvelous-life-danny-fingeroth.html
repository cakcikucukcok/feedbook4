  <title>A Marvelous Life - Danny Fingeroth</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The definitive biography of the beloved--often controversial--co-creator of many legendary superheroes, &lt;i&gt;A Marvelous Life: The Amazing Story of Stan Lee&lt;/i&gt; presents the origin of &quot;Stan the Man,&quot; who spun a storytelling web of comic book heroic adventures into a pop culture phenomenon: the Marvel Universe.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&quot;[Fingeroth&#39;s] intimate yet balanced account, highlights Lee&#39;s humanity, humor and even humility. But it doesn&#39;t ignore how his canny self-promotion at times shortchanged his collaborators and constrained his own choices.&quot;  --&lt;i&gt;Wall Street Journal&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;Stan Lee&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt; was the most famous American comic book creator who ever lived.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Thanks, especially, to his many &lt;b&gt;cameos&lt;/b&gt; in Marvel movies and TV shows, Lee was--and even after his 2018 death, still is--the voice and face of comics and popular culture in general, and Marvel Comics in particular. How he got to that place is a story that has never been &lt;i&gt;fully &lt;/i&gt;told--until &lt;i&gt;now.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;With creative partners including Jack Kirby and Steve Ditko--with whom he had tempestuous relationships that rivaled any superhero battle--Lee created world-famous characters including &lt;b&gt;Spider-Man, Iron Man, the X-Men, the Avengers,&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;the Hulk!&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But Lee&#39;s career was haunted by conflict and controversy. Was he the most innovative creator to ever do comics? Was he a lucky no-talent whose only skill was taking credit for others&#39; work? Or was he something else altogether?   &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Danny Fingeroth&#39;s &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;A Marvelous Life: The Amazing Story of Stan Lee&lt;/i&gt; &lt;/b&gt;attempts to answer some of those questions. It is the first comprehensive biography of this powerhouse of ideas who, with his invention of Marvel Comics, changed the world&#39;s ideas of what a hero is and how a story should be told. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;With exclusive interviews with Lee himself&lt;/b&gt;, as well as with colleagues, relatives, friends--and detractors--Fingeroth makes a doubly remarkable case for Lee&#39;s achievements, while not ignoring the &lt;b&gt;controversies&lt;/b&gt; that dogged him his entire life--and even past his death. With unique access to Lee&#39;s personal archives at the University of Wyoming, Fingeroth explores never-before-examined aspects of Lee&#39;s life and career, and digs under the surface of what people thought they knew about him.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Fingeroth, himself a longtime writer and editor at Marvel Comics, and now a lauded pop culture critic and historian, knew and worked with Stan Lee for over four decades. With his unique insights as a comics world insider, Fingeroth is able to put Lee&#39;s life and work in a unique context that makes events and actions come to life as no other writer could. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Despite F. Scott Fitzgerald&#39;s famous warning that &quot;There are no second acts in American lives,&quot; Stan Lee created a second act for himself that changed everything for him, his family, his industry, and ultimately for all of popular culture. How he did it--and what it cost him--is a larger-than-life tale of a man who helped create the modern superhero mythology that has become a part of all our lives.&lt;/p&gt;" />
