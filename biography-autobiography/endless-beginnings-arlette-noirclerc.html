  <title>Endless Beginnings - Arlette Noirclerc</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Arlette Noirclerc was born with a silver spoon in her mouth and spent her early childhood playing at the royal Chateau de Versailles. Those factors did not, however, lead to the life of leisure and luxury that she might have expected. Growing up in occupied France, Arlette learned early to fear the almighty German army, a fear that she was not released from until she witnessed American soldiers rescue France when they stormed Normandy on D-Day. It was on that day that her interest in America was piqued.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Throughout her life, Arlette has always felt guided spiritually. She grew curious about people and their spiritual philosophy and set out on her lifelong career in fashion, seemingly by chance, when a visit to London landed her a short stint as a representative for the House of Dior. Before long, she was offered a long-term position and the chance to live where her dreams carried herAmerica.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Arlette faced a series of peaks and valleys, from fame as a fashion designer and courtship by a Moroccan prince to life-threatening surgery and financial wipeouts. All of these things have contributed to her awakening about the laws of the Universe. In her memoir, Arlettes spiritual journey unfolds, demonstrating how, through it all, she was always able to make things work.&lt;/p&gt;" />
