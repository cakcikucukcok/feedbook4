  <title>Confessions of 5 Christian Wives - Shauna Mayer</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;What do a professional cheerleader and TV actress, a beauty queen, a simple housewife, and an international performer have in common? These women had troubled childhoods, abusive and unhappy marriages with such experiences as childhood rape, alcoholism, drug addiction, poverty, and sexual and physical abuse, just to name a few.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;These worldly women had personal issues and deep insecurities coupled with conflicts in their marriages, and desperately needed help and healing. They needed Gods help. When invited into their hearts, God begins to do the impossible, incredible, and unbelievable in every area of their lives and marriages as they learn to trust their heavenly Father.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After reading these heart-breaking and eventually triumphant true life stories, you, too, will want to know this God. He is indeed a living God and has proven Himself again and again to be a true Doting Daddy, healing their hearts and meeting their needs.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Hes there for you, too.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Would you like to meet Him?&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Youll meet Him in this book. Hes waiting for you.&lt;/p&gt;" />
