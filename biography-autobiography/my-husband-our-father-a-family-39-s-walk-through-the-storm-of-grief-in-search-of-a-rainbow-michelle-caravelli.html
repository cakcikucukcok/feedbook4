  <title>My Husband Our Father: a Family&#39;s Walk Through the Storm of Grief in Search of a Rainbow - Michelle Caravelli</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;After a loving, seventeen-year relationship with her husband, Gus, Michelle and her four children ages eighteen, fourteen, twelve, and ten each experience their own individual journeys into the storm of grief during and after the diagnosis of liver cancer. &lt;i&gt;My Husband Our Father: A Familys Walk Through the Storm of Grief in Search of a Rainbow&lt;/i&gt; is comprised of personal memoirs from a young widow, Michelle, and each of her four children: Brittany, Gina, Louie, and Madeline. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This book will lift your heart, as we have all gone through our own personal journey of grief at some point in our lives, searching for a rainbow of hope in order to move forward. &lt;i&gt;My Husband Our Father: A Family&#39;s Walk Through the Storm of Grief in Search of a Rainbow &lt;/i&gt;provides unique insight and an honest perspective on how we all grieve differently and how this can weigh heavily upon a family. Experience the enlightenment, inspiration, and empowerment that this book will offer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Truly inspirational is the transition between love, loss, and healing, as our lives move forward with our lost loved ones nearby. Step inside the hearts and minds of each family member to better understand the grieving process and better recognize the storm of grief in search of a rainbow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Feel free to visit our website for blogs and updates: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.insearchofarainbow.com&quot;&gt;www.insearchofarainbow.com&lt;/a&gt; And our Facebook Page: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.facebook.com/insearchofarainbow&quot;&gt;http://www.facebook.com/insearchofarainbow&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The writing of &lt;em&gt;My Husband Our Father&lt;/em&gt; involved each family member producing an unedited, candid memoir of experience before sharing with the family - and the result is a gripping chronicle of how life goes on and how recoveries happen at different levels. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The result is a poignant and moving memoir, highly recommended for any who have struggled with grief during challenging processes and times, which documents the separate journals and experiences of a family connected by the bonds of love, pain, and survival.&lt;/p&gt;
