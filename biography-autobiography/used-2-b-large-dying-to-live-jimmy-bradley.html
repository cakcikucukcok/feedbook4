  <title>Used 2 B Large: Dying to Live - Jimmy Bradley</title>
      <meta name="description" content="There are countless outlets for weight loss advice, but not many come from someone who has weighed in at 400 pounds and been at war with eating addiction. Used 2 B Large tells the story of Jimmy Bradley, a physical trainer, who began taking his health into his own hands as a child and grew up to physically and mentally motivate others who have dealt with out-of-control eating habits.   Bradley narrates how he tried the yo-yo diets and made the risky mistakes, only to learn to train for the reason that matters: loving yourself and becoming healthier for yourself. Used 2 B Large shares his journey from the shame of being the chubby kid in grade school, to the risky behavior that comes with trying to please people for superficial reasons, to getting his head on straight, and breaking the cycle with the next generation.   Sharing real-life stories and messages of motivation, this memoir offers advice and tips on how to avoid wasting years of your life seeking false happiness." />
