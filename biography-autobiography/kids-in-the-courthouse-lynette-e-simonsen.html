  <title>Kids in the Courthouse - Lynette E. Simonsen</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&quot;&lt;I&gt;Kids in the Courthouse&lt;/I&gt; is a nostalgic heartwarming story for all ages I certainly enjoyed the book and highly recommend it.&quot;&lt;br&gt;-Reviewed by Cheryl Miller for &lt;b&gt;Bookmarks&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;I&gt;SDLA&lt;/I&gt;, May/June 2004
&lt;p&gt;
&quot; the tales are told with humor and spice, as well as deep regard for the grandparents &quot;&lt;br&gt;-&lt;I&gt;&lt;b&gt;South Dakota Magazine&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/I&gt;, Nov/Dec 2003
&lt;p&gt;
Ever since I can remember, the Yankton County Courthouse was a second home to my brothers, sisters, the cousins, and me. The apartment in the corner of the building was just the right size for Grandma and Grandpa Bergen and their youngest daughter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
The county commissioners, who hired Grandpa as custodian, never realized his grandchildren would haunt the courthouse halls for years. Follow the escapades of the Bergen families as they create chaos in the courtroom and throw pigeon eggs off the roof. Witness the big boys&#39; soda pop thievery and discover who broke the beloved gumball machine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Visit small town America through the eyes of the grandchildren as they play in the courthouse and roam the streets of Yankton, South Dakota. Experience the joys and heartaches of the Bergen family as the grandchildren grow up and the grandparents grow old while living in the biggest house in town.&lt;/p&gt;" />
