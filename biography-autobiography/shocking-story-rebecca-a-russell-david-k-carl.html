  <title>Shocking Story - Rebecca A. Russell, David K. Carl</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This story is true, with very minimal alterations. Some of the names have been changed for lack of permissive authority. Any names not changed by the author are either deceased or a party to the motivating factor of this writing.
For many ill-spent years weve contemplated on gathering enough information along with the discipline necessary to put together the proper words and feelings into action.
The following pages are not meant for the sole purpose of complacency. However, we do hope it will be both helpful and pleasurable for reading.
The story has a span of 57 years,  from 1954 to 2011. It gradually rolls the years by showing the worst of life to its earthly best. 
We have a desire to share our story with others in hopes that it might be a reference of rectifiable use in ones own life. Our heart goes out to all who are experiencing Life at its worst But now, we know that things can always get better, Were living proof." />
