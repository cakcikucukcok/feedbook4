  <title>Hunting Men - Mike Davis</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Mike Davis grew up in eastern Oregon riding dirt bikes, hunting, fishing, and attempting to avoid the Oregon State Police. It was not until after a stint in the US Marines, however, that Davis joined the very department he once tried to evade and realized his long-held dream of arresting bad guys. He soon learned that there were citizens who did not respect law enforcementand some who wanted to kill anyone in uniform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Davis chronicles his diverse law enforcement experiences from 1977 until 2004, he provides a glimpse into a career path that led him from recruit school to stints as a patrol officer, detective, and SWAT team member specially trained in explosive disposal and breaching, weapons of mass destruction, arson investigations, and narcotics infiltrations. While sharing raw details from risky encounters that led him from arresting intoxicated citizens to heading undercover drug operations to posing as a hit man, Davis provides eye-opening insight into how a nave country boy transformed himself into a hardened hunter of men.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hunting Men shares the compelling story of an Oregon state police officers twenty-eight-year journey through law enforcement, facing many challenges along the way to uphold his oath to protect and serve the citizens of his state.&lt;/p&gt;" />
