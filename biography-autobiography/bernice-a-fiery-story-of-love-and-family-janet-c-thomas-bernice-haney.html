  <title>Bernice: a Fiery Story of Love and Family - Janet C. Thomas, Bernice Haney</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Bernice and her family was ostracized from their small town community when she was just a child, but no one ever talked about why. As a teenager she became involved with a man twelve years older than her. They had two kids before Bernice was twenty years old. She did her best to conform to the traditional role of mother and housewife. She became a member of the church and community. But in contrast to some 1950s housewives, she was forced to be self-reliant. For more than a decade she worked as a nurse at the Colorado State Hospital, dealing with the unimaginable, an abusive husband, and near-death. Life was never what she expected. But she dealt with it head on.
Bernice: A Fiery Story of Love and Family is a gripping account of survival and strength. But even deeper than its testament to endurance is its testament to love. Bernices loyalty and love of her family shines through each page. She is a woman of honesty and strong character, but more importantly, one of great humor and a pure heart. Beautifully told by her daughter, Janet Thomas, Bernice is an inspiration to us all. - Carlene Cross, author of Fleeing Fundamentalism and The Undying West" />
