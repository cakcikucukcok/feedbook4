  <title>Blood, Sweat, and Tears - Derrick E. White</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Black college football began during the nadir of African American life after the Civil War. The first game occurred in 1892, a little less than four years before the Supreme Court ruled segregation legal in &lt;i&gt;Plessy v. Ferguson&lt;/i&gt;. In spite of Jim Crow segregation, Black colleges produced some of the best football programs in the country. They mentored young men who became teachers, preachers, lawyers, and doctors--not to mention many other professions--and transformed Black communities. But when higher education was integrated, the programs faced existential challenges as predominately white institutions steadily set about recruiting their student athletes and hiring their coaches. &lt;i&gt;Blood, Sweat, and Tears&lt;/i&gt; explores the legacy of Black college football, with Florida A&amp;amp;M&#39;s Jake Gaither as its central character, one of the most successful coaches in its history. A paradoxical figure, Gaither led one of the most respected Black college football programs, yet many questioned his loyalties during the height of the civil rights movement.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Among the first broad-based histories of Black college athletics, Derrick E. White&#39;s sweeping story complicates the heroic narrative of integration and grapples with the complexities and contradictions of one of the most important sources of Black pride in the twentieth century.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;" />
