  <title>Life  -  a Struggle - Clemens Anton Wolters</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Clemens Wolters was born in Germany in 1908, one of five sons of a wealthy doctor. His life was a series of struggles, mostly during the backdrop of the changing German State from World War I through World War II into a new life in Canada and the United States of America.
Times of affluence and peace, German imperialism, war, unbelievable inflation, and unrest following the First World War.
A young husband with a business on the east side of the Polish Corridor. Drafted while standing in the showroom of his business and off to war in the northeastern part of East Prussia in the Baltic region. A family man with children still in East Prussia as the Third Reich began to collapse.
Following a nightmare of a retreat with his family across Germany to finally reach his father and brothers in Rheine, Westphalia.
His need to immigrate to North America for a better life for his family.
A good man who always found a way with humor, faith, and love to overcome tragic, dangerous, and changing circumstances." />
