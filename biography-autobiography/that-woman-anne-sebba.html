  <title>That Woman - Anne Sebba</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;The first full scale biography of Wallis Simpson to be written by a woman, exploring the mind of one of the most glamorous and reviled figures of the Twentieth Century, a character who played prominently in the blockbuster film &lt;/i&gt;The King&#39;s Speech.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is the story of the American divorcee notorious for allegedly seducing a British king off his throne.  &quot;That woman,&quot; so called by Queen Elizabeth, The Queen Mother, was born Bessie Wallis Warfield in 1896 in Baltimore.  Neither beautiful nor brilliant, she endured an impoverished childhood, which fostered in her a burning desire to rise above her circumstances.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Acclaimed biographer Anne Sebba offers an eye-opening account of one of the most talked about women of her generation.  It explores the obsessive nature of Simpson&#39;s relationship with Prince Edward, the suggestion that she may have had a Disorder of Sexual Development, and new evidence showing she may never have wanted to marry Edward at all. &lt;br&gt;Since her death, Simpson has become a symbol of female empowerment as well as a style icon.  But her psychology remains an enigma.  Drawing from interviews and newly discovered letters, &lt;i&gt;That Woman&lt;/i&gt; shines a light on this captivating and complex woman, an object of fascination that has only grown with the years.&lt;/p&gt;" />
