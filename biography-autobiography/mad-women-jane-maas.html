A real-life Peggy Olson reveals it all in this immensely entertaining and bittersweet memoir.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Mad Women&lt;/i&gt; is a tell-all account of life in the New York advertising world by Jane Maas, a copywriter who succeeded in the primarily male jungle depicted in the hit show &lt;i&gt;Mad Men&lt;/i&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fans of the show are dying to know how accurate it is: was there really that much sex at the office? Were there really three-martini lunches? Were women really second-class citizens? Jane Maas says the answer to all three questions is unequivocally &quot;yes.&quot; Her book, based on her own experiences and countless interviews with her peers, gives the full stories, from the junior account man whose wife almost left him when she found the copy of Screw magazine he&#39;d used to find &quot;a date&quot; for a client, to the Ogilvy &amp; Mather&#39;s annual Boat Ride, a sex-and-booze filled orgy, from which it was said no virgin ever returned intact. Wickedly funny and full of juicy inside information, &lt;i&gt;Mad Women&lt;/i&gt; also tackles some of the tougher issues of the era, such as unequal pay, rampant, jaw-dropping sexism, and the difficult choice many women faced between motherhood and their careers.&lt;/p&gt;" />
