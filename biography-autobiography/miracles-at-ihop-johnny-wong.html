  <title>Miracles at Ihop - Johnny Wong</title>
      <meta name="description" content="My book entitled &quot;Miracles at I hop,&quot; explained my experiences with the international house of prayer at Kansas City, Mo.  From January to the end of March, I gained some spiritual healing.  The friends I made at Kansas City, was overwhelming, such as my roommates, the Simeon, was some ways liked family to me.
Early morning, we had classes together in one of the building.  Mostly guest speakers from the house of payer.  Our main focus was 24/7 prayer in the prayer room.  By one o&#39; clock, shared the same lecture hall, with the FSM classes.
There&#39;s time, we went on outing, such as feeding the homeless, street evangelist, for example, spreading the good news during the Saint Patrict Day Parade.  Whenever someone needed housing or finance support, I hop often came through to assisted us.
There&#39;s moment where people hurt others by their actions or words, also needed to understand the international house of prayer not considered heaven, just a temporary place, where, individuals get some, either physical emotional pains was healed. 
&quot;Miracles at I hop wasn&#39;t just Johnny Wong miracles, but everybody miracles, women, men, girls and guys who lay hands to prayer over my mental conditions.  Whenever anybody go out of their way, either offering me a place to stay, just asking how I am doing, even giving a ride to the  supermarket, to FSM classes and to conference was a big help.
The Saturday home group, the Metro Church was a great time, having a wonderful meal together, laughing talking with each others.  Funny jokes about I hop, not a whole a lot of people, admired New Yorker, Chinese, Boston accent.  I hope this book, would be enjoyable for everybody at the international house of prayer.     
Sincerely, Johnny Wong" />
