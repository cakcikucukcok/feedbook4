And how she gazed into the eyes of her soul and questioned why she was surrounded by so much death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For 5 long years, the author Dee Delaney struggles to make sense of her life as she pushes, screams and battles with the dark shadows of grief that weave their way into the fabric of her very being, until one day on March 21&lt;sup&gt;st&lt;/sup&gt;, 2015, she stops everything and surrenders. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this honest, raw and sometimes humorous account, Dee explains how she finds the way back to her true self, through the richness of Eastern spirituality, and the wisdom of Western psychotherapy. As her story unfolds, Dee realises this suffering didn&amp;rsquo;t happen to her, it happened for her, and her &amp;lsquo;ordinary&amp;rsquo; life is transformed forever. Dee leaves her comfortable middle class life in England and starts a new life for herself and her little boy, in Goa India, where she discovers that her story is really only just beginning&amp;hellip;&amp;hellip;..&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Truth &amp;ndash; My Journey to the Other Side is part of an exciting trilogy of inspirational books called The Truth is Within.
