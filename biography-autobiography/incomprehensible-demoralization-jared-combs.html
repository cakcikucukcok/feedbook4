  <title>Incomprehensible Demoralization - Jared Combs</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;b&gt;Book Review:&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
5 Stars&lt;br&gt;
Courageous...
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
We have an erroneous vision of what an addict looks like. The person sitting next to you in church could be an addict. It could be your doctor, lawyer, postal worker, or the little old lady that lives next door. &lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Incomprehensible Demoralization&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; drew me in and held me captive. Jared Combs describes the life of an addict and pharmacist. His marriage was deteriorating, but the pills were more important. Through the Lord, his Church, the support of his family and AA, he has become a recovering addict. Combs seizes every opportunity to help others. Share his witness.
