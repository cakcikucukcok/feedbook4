  <title>Memoirs of Three Continents - Mirza Saeed-Uz Zafar Chaghrai</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Prof. Mirza Saeed-Uz Zafar Chaghtai is a renowned scholar, scientist and author of many books in various languages. He looks back at adventures that have spanned thousands of miles and included some of the worlds most remarkable people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With candor and humor, he outlines his social, political, and religious beliefs and shares insights on scientific and literary life in India, Europe, the United States of America, and elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His rise to the top of the scholarly community began in a small town in British India and brought him to Paris, London, Sweden and various places throughout the world, where he shared ideas with distinguished scientists, Nobel laureates, men of letters and many exemplary people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From rural and feudal British India to pragmatic and modern Europe, he honed his understanding of the world and, at times, went through personal, social, political, religious, scientific, and literary upheavals before returning home enthused to work for his people as a scholar and scientist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scholars, history buffs, and anyone eager to learn about people and places, especially India and Europe through the turn of the century, will be inspired and educated by Memoirs of Three Continents.&lt;/p&gt;" />
