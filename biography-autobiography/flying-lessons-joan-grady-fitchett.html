  <title>Flying Lessons - Joan Grady-Fitchett</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Like William Styron&#39;s &lt;i&gt;Darkness Visible&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Flying Lessons: On the Wings of Parkinson&#39;s Disease&lt;/i&gt; is a chronicle of the human spirit, an inspiring tale of life lived to the fullest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Joan Grady-Fitchett was diagnosed with Parkinson&#39;s disease, her doctor explained that this degenerative brain disorder would slowly steal her ability to walk, to speak clearly, and to care for herself, ultimately imprisoning her in a body she could no longer control.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rejecting this prognosis, Grady-Fitchett determined to live as she always had--full speed ahead. She&#39;d been a professional model, then one of Florida&#39;s most successful commercial real estate brokers, and soon after her diagnosis she bought and renovated an isolated farm in North Carolina.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Joan Grady-Fitchett participated in experimental drug programs that searched for medications that would alleviate Parkinson&#39;s symptoms with few side effects. She enrolled in a high-tech, experimental surgical program. And, somewhat to her own amazement, she fell in love with and married the man who is now her fourth husband.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In tragedy and triumph, Joan Grady-Fitchett has been sustained by a strong spiritual outlook and a deep appreciation of the natural world. In &lt;i&gt;Flying Lessons&lt;/i&gt;, Grady-Fitchett shares with the reader the strength of her soul and the power of her courage. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the Publisher&#39;s request, this title is being sold without Digital Rights Management Software (DRM) applied.&lt;/p&gt;" />
