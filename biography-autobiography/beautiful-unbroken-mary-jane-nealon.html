  <title>Beautiful Unbroken - Mary Jane Nealon</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;An unflinching memoir by a working nurse&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a child, Mary Jane Nealon dreams of growing up to become a saint or, failing that, a nurse. She idolizes Clara Barton, Kateri Tekakwitha, and Molly Pitcher, whose biographies she reads and rereads. But by the time she follows her calling to nursing school, her beloved younger brother is diagnosed with cancer, which challenges her to bring hope and healing closer to home. His death leaves her shattered, and she flees into her work, and into poetry. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Beautiful Unbroken &lt;/i&gt;details Nealon&#39;s life of caregiving, from her years as a flying nurse, untethered and free to follow friends and jobs from the Southwest to Savannah, to more somber years in New York City, treating men in a homeless shelter on the Bowery and working in the city&#39;s first AIDS wards. In this compelling and revealing memoir, Nealon brings a poet&#39;s sensitivity to bear on the hard truths of disease and recovery, life and death.&lt;/p&gt;" />
