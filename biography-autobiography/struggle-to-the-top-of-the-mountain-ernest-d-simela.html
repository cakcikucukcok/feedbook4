It is a story of a man chasing the American Dream told from an African perspective. It is a story which illustrates the power of setting goals and working hard  to  achieve them. The key is to stay focused.
Life is a journey sometimes fraught with many obstacles, highs and lows. In this book the reader will find reason to stay focused on their goal, inspiration to take them over the lows and  around the obstacles.
Come with me to the Top of The Mountain.

Enjoy the ride." />
