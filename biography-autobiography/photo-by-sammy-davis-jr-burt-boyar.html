  <title>Photo by Sammy Davis, Jr. - Burt Boyar</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Sammy Davis, Jr. will forever be remembered as one of America&amp;#39;s finest entertainers. An all&amp;#8211;around performer who could sing, dance, and act, Davis broke racial barriers in the entertainment world and became the only non&amp;#8211;white member of the Rat Pack. Only now, however, is Davis&amp;#39;s talent as a photographer finally being recognized. In this previously unpublished collection of black and white photography, readers will be fascinated by Davis&amp;#39;s portrayals of A&amp;#8211;list performers, iconic world leaders, and scenes from everyday life. Davis&amp;#39;s subjects include dozens of classic celebrities&amp;#8211;such as Frank Sinatra, Marilyn Monroe, Paul Newman, and James Dean&amp;#8211;who are often photographed at their most casual and revealing moments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Accompanying the pictures is an assortment of remembrances by Burt Boyar, a longtime friend and traveling companion of Davis who collaborated with the entertainer on both of his autobiographies. Through a series of memorable anecdotes, Boyar reflects on Davis&amp;#39;s many achievements as well as the private moments they shared as friends. Along with Davis&amp;#39;s candid shots of ordinary life&amp;#8211;from a group of children laughing to a baseball game at the Washington Monument&amp;#8211;these stories reveal a side of the performer far removed from his Rat Pack persona.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The release of this book will also coincide with the release of Burt Boyar&amp;#39;s upcoming documentary, Sammy Speaks, created from his extensive archive of taped conversations with the star.&lt;/p&gt;" />
