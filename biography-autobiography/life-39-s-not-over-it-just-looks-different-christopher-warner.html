  <title>Life&#39;s Not Over, It Just Looks Different - Christopher Warner</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Life happens, and sometimes it changes in ways that we never expected.   After experiencing a surgical complication that rendered me legally blind, I decided there were two choices ahead of me: roll over and die, essentially giving in to the fact that life wasn&#39;t going to be the same as before, or get on with life and figure out how to move forward with reduced eyesight.   This book shares a personal story of trying to bounce back from a life changing event. There were lots of good days and even some funny moments along the way. But no recovery is ever all smooth sailing. There were also bad days, and times when self-doubt and despair took over.   Over time though, I adjusted to the vision loss and learned to embrace the fact that I was given a unique opportunity to see life in a whole new way." />
