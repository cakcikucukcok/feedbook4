  <title>A Portrait of Mommy - J. L. Coston</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Ellawese Darden is a picture of beauty on the inside and out as her inner light shines brightly in this dark world. Affectionately known as Mommy, now at eighty-eight years old, she remains alert and vibrant while engaging in her daily work activities and conversations with others. She has a clear understanding of whats going on in todays world while keeping up with current events and always ready to discuss her opinion with anyone. Mommy has unselfishly showed love and compassion to others by giving of her time, talents, money and service. Her ultimate devotion and commitment to her faith through a personal relationship with Jesus Christ, has been her ultimate inspiration throughout her journey in life. She is a precious jewel to her family who has graciously shared her over the years with so many others who call her Mommy. This book tells her story! &lt;br /&gt;As Darden leads others through her story that began in a small town called Jacksonville, Georgia in 1929, she details a challenging early childhood after tragedy temporarily forced her family apart. They eventually reunited in Pennsylvania, and she chronicles a coming-of-age journey filled with bullying, heartache, and the abandonment of her mother when she was eighteen. As she matured into womanhood, Darden discloses how she learned to lean on her faith to find joy in everyday life while bravely facing hardship. &lt;br /&gt;A Portrait of Mommy reveals the true story of a woman and her journey through life that will inspire both the young and old to persevere, no matter what problem or obstacles they face. Darden weaves personal anecdotes with faith-filled messages encouraging forgiveness and unconditional love for everyone. This way of living will create an atmosphere of triumph during lifes most difficult times and challenges.&lt;/p&gt;" />
