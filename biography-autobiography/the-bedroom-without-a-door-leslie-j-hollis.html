  <title>The Bedroom Without a Door - Leslie J. Hollis</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;It was 1981&lt;/b&gt;the year life blew up in eighteen-year-old Leslie J. Hollis face. She couldnt get out of bed in the morning, and she cried all the time. If she had had the guts, she would have ended her life numerous times. The hurt and sense of worthlessness paled in comparison to death. It was also the year she met Kara, a talented psychotherapist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hollis knew life was not supposed to be characterized by constant pain, a longing to be accepted, and anxiety and worries that made it difficult to function. She was a ticking time bomb, imploding with distress. In &lt;I&gt;The Bedroom without a Door&lt;/I&gt;, Hollis shares the powerful life story of a young girl in search of her true self. She tells how she revisited the pain and isolation of her childhood to unlock the mysteries of the feelings she so desperately needed to escape from.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;I&gt;The Bedroom without a Door&lt;/I&gt;, Hollis helps those who feel vulnerable and defenseless and who have no sense of self. She shares how anxiety and pain, although overwhelming at times, can be confronted and treated. Depression and eating disorders can become a part of the past; a rebirth to a new, more productive life awaits. Learn to get out of bed every day and live, love, and laugh.&lt;/p&gt;" />
