  <title>Giacometti - James Lord</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The work of one of the towering creative spirits of the century, Alberto Giacometti&#39;s visionary sculptures and paintings from a testament to the artist&#39;s intriguing life story. From modest beginnings in a Swiss village, Giacometti went on to flourish in the picturesque milieu of prewar Paris and then to achieve international acclaim in the fifties and sixties. Picasso, Balthus, Samuel Beckett, Stravinsky and Sartre have parts in his story, along with flamboyant art dealers, whores, shady drifters, unscrupulous collectors, poets and thieves. Women were a complex yet important element of his life--particularly his wife, Annette, and his last mistress and model, Caroline--as was the intimate relationship he shared with his brother Diego, who was both Alberto&#39;s confidant and collaborator.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;James Lord was personally acquainted with Giacometti and his entourage, and combines firsthand experience with a unique knowledge gathered during many years of observation and research. In this exceptional biography Lord unfolds the personal history of a man who managed to achieve a heroic destiny by remaining utterly true to himself and to his calling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Giacometti: A Biography&lt;/i&gt; was nominated for the National Book Critics Circle Award. James Lord has subsequently published three volumes of memoirs. In recognition of his contribution to French culture he has been made an officer of the Legion of Honour.&lt;/p&gt;" />
