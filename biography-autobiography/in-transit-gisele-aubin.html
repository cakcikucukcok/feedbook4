  <title>In Transit - Gisele Aubin</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Gisele Aubin, a driven professional in her field was more often on airplanes than home. Always on the run, she left no time for a life. Her most faithful companion was her BlackBerry, and she had started thinking about dumping it. When the company she works for was sold, Gisele knew the time had come to make the changes she needed. At that point, jumping off the corporate ladder seemed to be her best way out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But when Gisele made her landing, she realized that her challenges were not those she had expected. She had no idea what to do next.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In this memoir, author Gisele Aubin shares her experience of turning her career around in order to create a more fulfilling life. Building on the knowledge gained through her experiences, Gisele provides an insight into what to expect when creating the successful change needed in your life. And its not what you think. Her message is that change is incremental and manageable if you are willing to take it one day at a time, let go of who you think you ought to be, and become the person you truly are.&lt;/p&gt;" />
