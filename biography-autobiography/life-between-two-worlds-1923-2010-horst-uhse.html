  <title>Life Between Two Worlds 1923-2010 - Horst Uhse</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Life Between two Worlds is a story written with great emotion. It is told by a German Immigrant who has seen the obstacles that life can put in your path. Life in Germany under a dictatorship cannot be put in any kind of comparison. 
As a small child, I already learned what hardship is by living with foster parents for two and one half years. My teen years were non-existing. World War II broke out and life was all rules and restrictions.  Obedience was the first commandm0ent.
As a soldier in the Africa Corp under General Rommel I experienced the horror of War, a War we knew from day one could never be won. When the War ended in 1943 life behind barbed wire in the United States was the result of an irresponsible war. 
When I returned to Germany in 1947, life was very depressing. Every city was a pile of rubble. My thoughts went back to America; to a land that I learned to love with its people who showed so much compassion for us when we were prisoners there.  From that day on, I knew that I was going back to America to give my children a future. When I arrived with my family of five in New York with four dollars in my pocket, I knew that was all I needed to succeed." />
