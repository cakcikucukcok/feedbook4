  <title>Proud of What I Was — a Soldier - Richard Dan Hill</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Anyone who ever served in the military can tell a similar story. The circumstances change and the names are different, but when you deal with young soldiers anything is probable. Hill tells the reader about many of these young men and women in some very funny situations. He also details what it is like to be the commander of a unit with 200 or more of these soldiers, in peacetime and in war. In telling the story of his long and varied career, he offers some real leadership gems that carry over to industry. As one observer quipped, every Lieutenant should read this book before spending a day with troops; he will either resign his commission or stay in the military until they kick him out.
The author refers to the family members of military members as the real heroes in the military. You will gain a whole new appreciation of what it is like to be an Army spouse. Hill and his wife, Carla, moved 16 times during his 24 year career. Once children came along, it meant new adventures, along with new schools and new friends. The term
Army Brat is worn with pride, but it is a title that is hard earned. One knows that military families are nomads, but the author explains how assignments happen and the consequences of decisions on careers and promotion. He tells the reader about dealing with the ubiquitous assignment offi cer. The citizen who has never been around the military will learn a great deal about the inner workings of the career Army Officer and those who support them. You will laugh out loud at some of these tales and cry when you learn about the sacrifices these soldiers and the families make. You will swell with pride when you hear how some of these men respond from unspeakable adversity. Hill is unabashedly proud of all veterans and as the title states, he is proud of his many years of serviceHe is Proud of What he wasA soldier." />
