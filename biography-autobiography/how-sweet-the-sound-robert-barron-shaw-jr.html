  <title>How Sweet the Sound! - Robert Barron Shaw Jr.</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The narrative chronicles the life of Robert Barron Shaw, Jr., a blind entrepreneur. The text is written as a dialogue with his grandchildren, Amanda, Justin, and Jeremy, who probe into their grandfather&#39;s history, which holds many ironies and twists of fate.  He was just a boy from Memphis, TN, living with his parents and siblings, 
when one day he received a diagnosis that would change his life forever.  At first, he shrouded himself in secrecy, fearing the repercussions of misguided judgments and stereotypes.  As a result, he navigated through the world as though life proceeded as usual  but nothing about his life was ordinary, by any stretch of the imagination! Through courage, force of will, and a steadfast commitment to personal accountability, Barry (as he is affectionately known to friends and family) redefined and transcended the limits of so-called &quot;normalcy&quot; to achieve unprecedented success in business and in life.  Just as Barry has been guided by the example of his ancestors, he became a mentor to his grandchildren, young people in general, and virtually anyone who feels marginalized or beset by life&#39;s challenges. 
 &quot;Stand for something.  Make the rules work for you ... or write your own set of rules.&quot; This is but one of Barry&#39;s maxims that have defined his story. How Sweet the Sound! My Journey Through a Sighted World is a page-turner that promises to have a lasting impact." />
