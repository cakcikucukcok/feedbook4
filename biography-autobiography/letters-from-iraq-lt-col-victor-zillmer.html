  <title>Letters from Iraq - Lt Col Victor Zillmer</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Letters from Iraq is written around letters sent home and documents written at the time that show the people and the day-to-day operations of a United States Army Corps of Engineer unit from September 11, 2001, until March 2006. It is a story of all the local Iraqis, foreign nationals, military personnel, and civilian volunteers who struggled in the heat and sun, mud and cold, to support the army and rebuild Iraq. History records the deeds, both good and bad, of the leaders, but for those who toiled in the hot sun, under constant threat of death, often only because they had to feed their families, there is no record. This is their story." />
