  <title>Why Bob Dylan Matters, Revised Edition - Richard F. Thomas</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;#8220;The coolest class on campus&amp;#8221; &amp;#8211; The New York Times&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the Nobel Prize for Literature was awarded to Bob Dylan in 2016, a debate raged. Some celebrated, while many others questioned the choice.&amp;#160; How could the world&amp;#8217;s most prestigious book prize be awarded to a famously cantankerous singer-songwriter who wouldn&amp;#8217;t even deign to attend the medal ceremony?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Why Bob Dylan Matters, Harvard Professor Richard F. Thomas answers this question with magisterial erudition. A world expert on Classical poetry, Thomas was initially ridiculed by his colleagues for teaching a course on Bob Dylan alongside his traditional seminars on Homer, Virgil, and Ovid. Dylan&amp;#8217;s Nobel Prize brought him vindication, and he immediately found himself thrust into the spotlight as a leading academic voice in all matters Dylanological. Today, through his wildly popular Dylan seminar&amp;#8212;affectionately dubbed &quot;Dylan 101&quot;&amp;#8212;Thomas is introducing a new generation of fans and scholars to the revered bard&amp;#8217;s work. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This witty, personal volume is a distillation of Thomas&amp;#8217;s famous course, and makes a compelling case for moving Dylan out of the Rock &amp;#38; Roll Hall of Fame and into the pantheon of Classical poets. Asking us to reflect on the question, &quot;What makes a classic?&quot;, Thomas offers an eloquent argument for Dylan&amp;#8217;s modern relevance, while interpreting and decoding Dylan&amp;#8217;s lyrics for readers. The most original and compelling volume on Dylan in decades, Why Bob Dylan Matters will illuminate Dylan&amp;#8217;s work for the Dylan neophyte and the seasoned fanatic alike. You&amp;#8217;ll never think about Bob Dylan in the same way again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#160;&lt;/p&gt;" />
