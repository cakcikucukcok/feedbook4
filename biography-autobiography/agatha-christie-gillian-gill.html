  <title>Agatha Christie - Gillian Gill</title>
      <meta name="description" content="In this sensitive and revealing biography of Agatha Christie, Gillian Gill probes the mysterious private life and motivations of one of the bestselling authors of all time and discovers a brilliant and eccentric woman whose passionate search for success was balanced by an obsession with privacy.
The break-up of Agatha&#39;s first marriage to Archibald Christie and her subsequent ten-day disappearance had made headline news. Feeling hunted and wounded by the press, Christie determined never again to let them into her private life. Instead she developed a public persona - seemingly tongue-tied and dull - which ensured the journalists and the public would let her be. This successful strategy helped to account for a happy second marriage and family life as well as an astonishing literary productivity.
Skillfully weaving the details of Christie&#39;s life with the plots and characters of her mystery novels, Gillian Gill uncovers the flesh-and-blood woman behind the popular and celebrated Marple-like image, and establishes Agatha Christie as a unique and determined person whose fictional creations sparked the imagination of millions around the world." />
