  <title>What Really Goes on in That Head of Yours? - Christy Koleszar</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&quot;What Really Goes On In That Head of Yours&quot; is about a Medium delving into the Unknown. About the brain and what you can see and feel is happening around you when you are having a psychotic breakdown. It is a journey which can only be described as pure hell which Christy experienced on and off for over 5 years. 
&quot;What Really Goes On In That Head of Yours&quot; is one of a kind, unique in that no one has seen or experienced as much as she has going through a psychotic breakdown.
My journey as a Medium over a span of 5 years. A rollercoaster of emotions, of highs and lows. Seeing the unexplained, experiencing the unbelievable. What the brain can conjure up when you are heading for a nervous breakdown.  A journey into the Unknown. What a Medium experiences when she is going through psychosis. Is it real? It is to her and it is a journey into hell she never wants to experience again.
Delving into the unknown of the paranormal with a twist. Seeing the unexplained whilst living through what can be only described as a Medium&#39;s worst nightmare." />
