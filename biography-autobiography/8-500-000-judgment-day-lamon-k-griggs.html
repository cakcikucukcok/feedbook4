  <title>,500,000 Judgment Day - Lamon K. Griggs</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;
$8,500,000 Judgment Day is a revealing and true account of what happened after a Mississippi-based Walmart employee was falsely accused by the retailer of shoplifting, and later fired.  How he took on the world&#39;s number one retailer and gave them a &#39;country whippin&#39; in court is only part of the story.
Author Lamon Griggs takes us behind the clever slogans, discount clothing and saccharine greeters to give us a view of the Walmart that countless broadcast and print media sources have been reporting for years:  Walmart isn&#39;t quite the good neighbor or benevolent retailer their marketing department wants us to believe they are.  Griggs is neither a novelist nor an investigative journalist, but that&#39;s what makes $8,500,000 Judgment Day all the more disquieting.  Griggs documents how Walmart mistreats it&#39;s employees, supports overseas manufacturing and even profiles it&#39;s customers.  He immerses us completely in the Walmart culture -warts and all- without any unnecessary Walmart bashing.  He&#39;s got a story to tell, and he does so in his unhurried, thoughtful southern cadence.  After all, this is a former Mississippi Highway Patrol Trooper who spent almost 5 years of his life and nearly lost everything to prove he did not steal a dollar and fifty cents worth of chewing tobacco.
Very quickly, $8,500,000 Judgment Day becomes a destined-for-Hollywood-must-read guilty pleasure once we&#39;re introduced to Walmart&#39;s cadre of senior level executives, department managers, missing witnesses, hidden documents, and high-priced shark attorneys.  I bet you may know some of these people.  And yes, there&#39;s even a happy ending here for Griggs.  
When reading $8,500,000 Judgment Day, you&#39;ll experience chapter after chapter of an uncompromising drive to uncover and expose a culture that feeds on the weakness of people.  You will get a better understanding of complete corporate dominance." />
