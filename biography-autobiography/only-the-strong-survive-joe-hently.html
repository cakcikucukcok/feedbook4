  <title>Only the Strong Survive - Joe Hently</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;My military career would be from February 28, 1956 to March 31, 1976. My Air Force specialty code was 65170-Procurment Supervisor, secondary specialty was 64570, Inventory Management Supervisor, which was a political correct name for the Supply Sergeant or NCOIC. I worked in about every field in the service part of Air Force from Physical Ed. Instructor to teaching warfare technique. I always had a great group people and we were successful, because I was able to always teach respect for one another, which led to a good outfit. Great leaders are born and I was a damn good leader of human beings!&lt;br /&gt;I would have been great in the military or civilian life, but the military was able to give me my discipline and organizational skills to accomplish any task given, because with my faith, prayer and the knowledge that I am who I am, I knew I could do anything that I was able to do to completion! I was top of my NCO leadership school, and top of the NCO Academy. I was one of the first to enter a one year school in N.Y. called the Blue Suiter Program Military Group for the first computer system to be operated by military personnel, the UNIVAC 1050 computer system for the Air Force (1964). My job was NCOIC of 100, 000 line items (spare parts) for the complete system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Procurement school, Lowry AFB, Denver Colorado, I held a GPA of 4.0 and was class president. There was a college ECI course through the University of Maryland. I completed 71 courses in other career fields as an Airman that I was in charge of. I knew as much about other missions as other folks did. I also completed all the other 27 courses and related jobs of my career field, which gave me enough credits for a BA college degree! Some of my accomplishments were EOC NCOIC, Commissioner of the 5 BX Program, Exercise and Diet base level, Base schools and all squadron activity to operate a Base. &lt;br /&gt;My Masonic Order and my involvement as a captain of the semi-pro football team gave a platform to involve the Base and the city in football, flag football, softball, baseball, bowling, little and pony leagues (8-14 yr old boys after school football program) for training if there grade point average were up to a 3.0, a Thanksgiving Program for the needy every November, a program for the disadvantage kids, which included seven Masonic brothers as big brother and role models. If they had a problem they would call their best troubleshooter and I was always successful, because I treated each person as a human being and with respect, not as cattle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Decorations and Awards: VSM w/2 BSS, RVSM, AFOVA, AFGCM w/3 OLC, AFLSA w/4 OLC, AFM 900-3.&lt;br /&gt;There would have been other medals if I had showed up for the award ceremonies. I would not accept the damn medals if I was not accepted as human being or as a patriot in this racist system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was never promoted passed the rank of Technical Sgt/ E-6, because I could not in good conscience stay out of the movement for the rights of all humans, not just my Black Pride, which was also on display, so the Air Force has labeled me as a Communist Agitator.&lt;/p&gt;" />
