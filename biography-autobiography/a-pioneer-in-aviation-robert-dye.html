  <title>A Pioneer in Aviation - Robert Dye</title>
      <meta name="description" content="From an early age, Brice H. Goldsborough exhibited an unending curiosity about the world around him; he was interested in almost anything mechanical, was inquisitive about weather patterns, and yearned to know more about aerodynamics. This lifelong quest for information led him to found Pioneer Instrument Company in New York in 1919, a firm that eventually became one of the worlds largest producers of reliable aviation instruments. 
In this biography, author Robert Dye, Goldsboroughs great-nephew, tells the story of a man who became an expert in meteorology, navigation, and aircraft instrument design and changed the course of aviation history. Based on personal letters, articles, and news clippings, &lt;i&gt;A Pioneer in Aviation&lt;/i&gt; follows Goldsboroughs life as a teen, his time in the navy studying electricity, and his accomplishments, such as establishing Chinas first offshore radio station and supervising the construction of Haitis first radio station. 
Detailing one of aviations unsung heroes, &lt;i&gt;A Pioneer in Aviation&lt;/i&gt; shows the man who designed, built, and installed the instrument panel for &lt;i&gt;The Spirit of St. Louis&lt;/i&gt; and flew with Charles Lindbergh during September 1927 and how he came to be associated with other great names in aviation history such as Glenn Curtiss, Clyde Cessna, Walter Beech, and Igor Sikorsky." />
