  <title>Life Begins at Fifty - Helen Carver</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Twenty years from now you will be more disappointed by the things you didnt do than by the ones you did do.&lt;br /&gt;Mark Twain&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ever wondered if there must be more to life than this?&lt;br /&gt;Ever thought, Its now or never?&lt;br /&gt;Ever wanted to travel the world?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Me too!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the ripe old age of fifty, I decided I wanted some fun - I wanted to live rather than just exist! I wanted some wild and whacky experiences to tell my grandchildren about in years to come.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, after years of feeling like a hamster in a wheel, juggling work with children, I rebelled in the most spectacular way. I walked away from my job, rented my house out, went off travelling around the world for six months with my nineteen-year-old daughter, and embraced a whole new way of life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hope you laugh as much as we did at the crazy things that happened to us and the madcap things we tried (white-water rafting, skydiving, hiking up glaciers, jumping off waterfalls and posing naked in front of them, to name a few).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hope it makes you realise that you only get one life, and now is the time to start living it, doing what you really want to and enjoying every precious moment. Follow your dreamsyoull be amazed where they take you! I did, and my life has never been the same since.&lt;/p&gt;
