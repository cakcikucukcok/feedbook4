  <title>God&#39;s Spoken Word - Prophetess Gwendolyn King</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;This story is God&#39;s strategic plan for one of his endtime Prophets. The narrative chronicles her life; it is not the sugar coated dialogue you read in a lot of inspirational self help books. Its a straightforward insight into the process leading up to her prophetic walk Christ - of molestation, rape, drug addiction, abusive relationships, racial discrimination, hate crime, prison hustling and living a true thugs life - becoming a sought after drug dealer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Page after page, this book illustrates the redeeming power of Jesus as he supernaturally transforms his chosen vessel with his healing power and delivering love. How the Holy Ghost mold and shape her into one of its awesome weapons in the kingdom of God today and filled her with knowledge of his word which she applied to her walk with Him. God&#39;s word taught her how to forgive her molester, her rapist and the racist people who conspired against her. She has been transformed by the renewal of her mind and today her mind is the mind of Christ. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prophetess Gwendolyn has a compassion for the lost creations of God and has been gifted by God&#39;s Kingdom with a mantle, anointed and assigned to go and preach the life she lives. With a humble love for her brothers and sisters on prison lockdown because it couldve been her in prison today; she candidly spreads the gospel, focusing on healing the heart and mind and bringing the lost to Christ . If there is someone in your family today who is struggling or has struggled with drug addiction, sexual abuse, racial bias, or any adversity, this book illustrates that there is hope. Always remember Jesus is Lord! The Holy Ghost is always on his post as the deliverer of the world. He can do anything but fail.&lt;/p&gt;" />
