  <title>Cinnia’S Story - Lily Violet</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Cinnias Story is the true story of a girl whose life was full of unexpected events. From a very young age, she found herself in a war zone, losing her home and having to live day to day in fear for her own life and her familys lives. Throughout her teenage years, she was bullied, but that only made her humbler and kinder. Family support and love played very important roles in her upbringing. Moving to Australia, getting married in her early twenties, experiencing very difficult years, and going through a divorce definitely have an impact on who she has become. She loves food and being a professional chef. All the health issues she faced tested her passion for the industry, but theyve only made her more determined in what she really wants to achieve. 
The most beautiful parts of her life occur, and she realizes how blessed she has been in finding the courage to love, to truly be happy, and to believe in the magic of life and that miracles do happen. Becoming a mother is one of the greatest gifts in her life and her greatest accomplishment." />
