  <title>May Day: Recovering Humor from a Stroke - Anna Marie Porter</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Less than two months past her fifty-third birthday Anna Marie Porter suffered a stroke caused by the rupture of a cerebral cavernous malformation. She was suddenly paralyzed on her right side, unable to use any of her appendages save three fingers In the wake of such a life-altering event--and faced with months of rehab--she found comfort in poking fun at her situation; humor became her survival mechanism. What&#39;s so funny about having a stroke? Not much unless you have a healthy sense of humor--or even an unhealthy one! And if you&#39;re going to take a death-defying leap into the world of serious illness, &quot;What good is sitting alone in your room?&quot; So she didn&#39;t. She invited her friends, family, and colleagues in to her virtual hospital room through an online blog. That blog became the basis for this book. May Day: Recovering Humor From a Stroke is sometimes poignant, often funny, and always an enlightening look into the world of recovering from a serious setback." />
