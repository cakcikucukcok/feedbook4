  <title>The World Was My Shepherd - Ben Shocklin</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The World Was My Shepherd&lt;/em&gt; shares the story of &lt;strong&gt;Ben Shocklins&lt;/strong&gt; life. Filled with hope and security, he had a childhood most people only dream oflots of family time, vacations, game nights, and time with friends. His life suddenly changes after viewing disturbing images and experiencing inconsistent, improper behavior from the God-fearing parents he placed on a pedestal. What began as an idyllic childhood transformed into something entirely different.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His experiences with intimacy and normal relationships were hindered by this distorted past, leading him through a life of worldly desires and an occasional glimpse of greatness through Christ. He takes us through the good and bad, the righteous and the evil of this world, explicitly detailing his life experiences with teenage love, a failed marriage, drug-filled naval adventures, addictions, lost romance, accidental death, and sexual escapades while trying to get sober in AA.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Though aware that God was present in his life, again and again Ben fell victim to his own desires, Satans temptations, and a secular world full of hedonism, hypocrisy, and contradiction. &lt;em&gt;The World Was My Shepherd&lt;/em&gt; is Bens personal journey brought to life through provocative reflection, graphic imagery, and candid storytelling.&lt;/p&gt;" />
