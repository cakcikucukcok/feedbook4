  <title>A Bridge with Three Spans - Zia Uddin Ahmed</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;A Bridge with Three Spans: An Indian Muslim Boy Lives through Major Events of the Twentieth Century tells the threefold story of a boy who grew up in Bihar, India, attended college and worked as a civil servant in Pakistan, and then traveled abroad through his years working for the International Center of Public Enterprises and the United Nations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chronicling his early life in rural and small town India, Ahmed then recalls his life as a college student and civil servant in Pakistan. It was a time of intensifying communal conflicts set within the backdrop of major historical events, which created a profound concern in Ahmed for the fate of millions of poor and helpless people of the subcontinent. The stunning contrast of geography and cultural heritage between the countries where Ahmed served evoked a deep love of the natural world and profound curiosity about ancient history. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Through it all, Ahmed remained dedicated to excellence in education and intellectual development. This memoir recounts the fascinating stories of a man who has crossed the borders of countries from India to America and encountered amazing events and intriguing people along the way.&lt;/p&gt;" />
