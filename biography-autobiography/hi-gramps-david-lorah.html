  <title>Hi, Gramps! - David Lorah</title>
      <meta name="description" content="An old man, affectionately known as Gramps, remembers and records some of the major events that shaped his life; from the accidental death of his only son to his own declining years.  
Spot-lighted are the lives of four boys.  We watch appalled as Chase, the biological grandson, deals with cancer.  We follow the maturing of Roger (who is rescued and subsequently adopted by Gramps) as he deals with a haunting past; Bradley, a young American boy who becomes an honorary grandson adding to the fun-side of Gramps experiences; and we feel for Edward as he deals with the loss of his best friend and later a disastrous courtship.
Meet the Rev. Dr. James Hayward, the pompous headmaster of St. Johns; the over-weight, tactless Mrs. Henderson with her multiple chins; Caleb, the avid young fisherman who springs a surprise on Chase and Bradley that neither of them would ever have expected; the young Indian schoolboy who is victimized by the school bullies; young Phelps, the rat-faced stooge of the cowardly Harrington-Blake and others.
The author has presented his public with an inspirational book that deals with issues such as the unfairness of life; stereotyping; judgmentalism; racism; corporal punishment; guilt; past regret; heartbreak; death; etc., from a practical, Christian perspective without being &quot;preachy&quot;." />
