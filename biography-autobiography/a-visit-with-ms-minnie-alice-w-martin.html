  <title>A Visit with Ms.  Minnie - Alice W. Martin</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The story surrounds the life and times of Minnie Johnson Burruss, who was born and raised in rural America around the turn of the 20th Century. Growing up poor but proud Ms. Minnie had to work hard from childhood through adulthood. As a teenager, she met and married a true gentleman named Jacob Burruss. With a houseful of children, a lot of wisdom and a strong faith in God, they lived through the Great Depression and many other trials and tribulations, including the fire that consumed their son, Matthew. 
Meet Emma and Annie Lou, Jacobs two sisters, loving but as different as night and day. Contrast Emmas quiet spirit with the insatiable Annie Lou who slips away frequently into the dark of the night.  
This story (italicized words) is narrated by Ms. Minnie a few years before her death and is based on true events. Only the storyline has been embellished by the author. The characters names and the geographical locations have been changed to protect the innocent.
Sit back and take a trip back through time as you spend an evening with Ms. Minnie.
