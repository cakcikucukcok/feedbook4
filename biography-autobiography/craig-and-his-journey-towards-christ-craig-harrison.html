  <title>Craig and His Journey Towards Christ - Craig Harrison</title>
      <meta name="description" content="My name is Craig Thomas Harrison, I am living proof there is a God.
I have received not one, but several miracles from heaven. I first thought it was all through
luck and coincidence. That was until Jesus Christ manifested His glorious supernatural force
about a week after the 27th of February 2011, when I had my last alcoholic drink.
The day He stepped into my life, I crashed to my knees in awe of his magnificent presence
and entity...
I confessed my love to the Lord of all lords, a love that is stronger than that I give to my
parents and asked Him to forgive me of my sins. He has blessed me with the mind and spirit
of Christ.
He has healed me of alcoholism, the occasional hard drug use, smoking, manic depression
and obsessive compulsive disorder, lust and fear other than for Him. He has given me my life
back abundantly.
I now live a holier lifestyle and do my best to follow the commandments given by Jesus and
put God first, then my family, next my friends and then myself.
I do not serve money as my master anymore but our heavenly Father instead.
I put my trust in the Lord with all my heart nowadays, one thing I do know; He has always
put his trust in me...
Romans 10:9
If you declare with your mouth, Jesus is Lord, and believe in your heart that God raised Him
from the dead, you will be saved.
Prayer:
Jesus, I want to make a brand new start with You. Thank You that You made this possible
when You died on the cross for me. I turn to You now. I confess that You, Jesus, are Lord, and
I believe in my heart that God raised You from the dead. Thank You that I am now saved.
Please live within my heart and transform me by your power. Thank You Jesus.
Amen.
Life on Earth is short compared to eternity in heaven. I believe if more people lived their
lives in accordance with the gospel; the world would become a more beautiful place.
Jesus is ready and willing to gracefully bless anyone with the mind of Christ, the heart of a
lion, humility and the spirit of God.
This book is inspired by and written by a divine spirit that magnificently dwells inside of
me, it is called the Holy Ghost.
I feel Christs hand on my brain whenever I write now, so I just let the Lord do his thing.
This is my truthful, honest, sincere and miraculous testimony to Jesus our Lord and God." />
