  <title>But Enough About Me - Jancee Dunn</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The second I stepped through the doors of &lt;em&gt;Rolling Stone&lt;/em&gt; as a real employee, I wanted to shake off my old personality like the rigid husk of a cicada. But how could I cultivate a new, hip persona when I lived with my parents in a New Jersey suburb and wore black leggings as pants?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;New Jersey in the 1980s had everything Jancee Dunn wanted: trips down the shore, Bruce Springsteen, a tantalizing array of malls, and, especially, her family. Barreling down the Turnpike in her parents&amp;#8217; Buick LeSabre, her perm brushing the ceiling of the car, she felt ragingly alive. But one night she met a girl who worked at &lt;em&gt;Rolling Stone&lt;/em&gt; magazine in New York City. To Jancee, who visited the city exactly once a year with her parents and two sisters, New York might as well have been in Canada. But she loved music, so with bleak expectations she passed along her r&amp;#233;sum&amp;#233;, dashing her father&amp;#8217;s hopes that she would carry on the family legacy of service to J. C. Penney (a man so revered that a bust of his head was proudly displayed in the den) .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Soon Jancee found herself backstage and behind the scenes, interviewing a countless (and nerve-racking) parade of some of the most famous people in the world, among them Madonna, Cameron Diaz, and Beyonc&amp;#233;. She trekked to the Canadian Rockies to hike with Brad Pitt, was chased by paparazzi who mistook her for Ben Affleck&amp;#8217;s new girlfriend, snacked on Velveeta with Dolly Parton, and danced drunkenly onstage with the Beastie Boys. She even became a TV star as a pioneering VJ on MTV2. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As her life spun faster, she plunged into the booze-soaked rock-and-roll life, trading her good-girl suburban past for late nights and hipster guys. But then a chance meeting turned Jancee&amp;#8217;s life in an unexpected direction and helped her to finally learn to appreciate where she came from, who she was, and what she wanted to be.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Riotously funny and tremendously touching, &lt;em&gt;But Enough About Me&lt;/em&gt; is the story of an outsider who couldn&amp;#8217;t quite bring herself to become an insider and introduces readers to a hysterical, lovable real-life heroine.  &lt;/p&gt;" />
