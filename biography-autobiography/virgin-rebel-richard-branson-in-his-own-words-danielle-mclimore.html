  <title>Virgin Rebel: Richard Branson In His Own Words - Danielle McLimore</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;Richard Branson, who has been called &quot;England&#39;s most outrageous billionaire,&quot; is also one of the world&#39;s most successful business leaders. Since the age of 16, when he founded &lt;I&gt;Student&lt;/I&gt; magazine, Branson has been creating companies and finding innovative ways to grow them into the prodigious conglomerate known as the Virgin Group. At the age of 20, Branson founded a mail-order record retailer. Two years later he built a recording studio where the first artist signed to his Virgin label, Mike Oldfield, recorded the haunting soundtrack to &lt;I&gt;The Exorcist.&lt;/I&gt; Decades later, industries as varied as entertainment (Virgin Music), retail (Virgin Megastores), transportation (Virgin Airlines), and telecommunications (Virgin Mobile) all bear Branson&#39;s business moniker. For the first time, the most thought-provoking, revealing, and inspiring quotes from Branson are compiled in a single book.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;I&gt;Virgin Rebel: Richard Branson in His Own Words&lt;/I&gt; is a comprehensive guidebook to the inner workings of the Virgin Group chairman and founder. Hundreds of Branson&#39;s best quotes, comprising thoughts on business, music, entrepreneurship, politics, exploration, and life lessons, provide an intimate and direct look into the mind of this modern business icon.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/div&gt;" />
