  <title>A Legacy for the Eight of Us - Catherine M. Cavanaugh</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;This book is about our early family life. But the story is much more. It is about life itself  the life experiences that all of us share.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&quot;A Legacy for the Eight of Us&quot; begins with a look back at some of our ancestors, next describes Daddy and Mama&#39;s early lives and continues with their marriage in 1925. It then focuses on the early life of their family  my seven siblings and myself -- concentrating on our life during the 1930s and 40s.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;This life took place in another era on a farm in central Illinois. You will read vivid details of that life. You will share in our familys interactions, our heritage, our faith, our love of the land; but you also will share in our challenges and shortcomings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I wrote this book, I kept in mind the admonition heard at a series of Barn Lectures at the Carson Valley Museum: &quot;We cannot know where we are going as a people until we know where we have been.&quot;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;It can be beneficial for each of us to discover our own individual legacies. From the memories captured in these pages, I hope you discover more about our familys legacy.&lt;/p&gt;" />
