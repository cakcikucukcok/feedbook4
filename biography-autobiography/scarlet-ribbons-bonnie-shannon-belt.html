  <title>Scarlet Ribbons - Bonnie Shannon Belt</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Memoirs of Everyday Miracles depicts encounters with angels and miraculous answers to prayer in this uplifting memoir of a womans dedication to God and her family.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A caregiver at the age of nine for her dying mother, Bonnie makes a promise to God after receiving a miracle. The answered prayer leaves her with a deep faith and a firm belief: with God, all things are possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bonnie grows up to be a singer/ songwriter, and she and her mother set out to find fame in the music business. But stardom eludes Bonnie until she marries a man in Phoenix, Arizona, and finds success when she becomes the featured vocalist at his nightclub.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When her mother and brothers health begin to fail, Bonnie juggles her singing career with trips to California, where they live, to care for them. Rededicating her life to God, she sets out on her own to become a full-time caregiver for her mother.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a collection of short stories, you will see Gods hand in Bonnies life as He gifts her with the desires of her heart, including a new career in music, working for gospel singer Vern Jackson, and a friendship with her mentor, Grammy Award-winning artist Jody Miller. From family pets to face cream to new songs, Bonnie&#39;s prayers are answered as God provides, in wondrous ways, all her everyday needs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you follow in Bonnies footsteps of faith, this treasury of moving stories will touch your heart with the assurance that you never walk alone. God is with you always.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&quot;Scarlet Ribbons is a beautiful testament to the power in believing.&quot; &lt;br /&gt;Victoria Vincent, author, The City of Kind Words&lt;/p&gt;" />
