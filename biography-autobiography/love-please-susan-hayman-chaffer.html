  <title>Love, Please - Susan Hayman-Chaffer</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Love, Please&lt;/em&gt; is a memoir of a timeless love story between a man and a woman from opposite sides of the world. They meet in Tokyo when she is there on tour, and each immediately realizes they are soul-mates. Their story unfolds over a period of seventeen years, from the mid seventies to the early nineties, chronicling the extraordinary adventure of their lives together. Satoru Oishi is a architect and sculptor who works with Jasper Johns and Phillip Johnson. Susana Hayman-Chaffey is a soloist with the Merce Cunningham Dance Company. The backdrop is their Manhattan loft, from which they travel around the world making a living any way they can, and learning about life through dramatic, often humorous, ups and downs. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is a voyage of love between two people, their families, friends and children. It encourages and inspires us to keep faith in the midst of what seems to be an impossible life journey, proving that, with courage and determination, anything can be accomplished. It is a human story told simply and honestly about life and love.&lt;/p&gt;" />
