      <meta name="description" content="This work offers a summary of the book &quot;CRUSH IT!: Why Now is the Time to Cash In on Your Passion&quot; by Gary Vaynerchuk.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Crush it! is all about enabling you to live your passion. Author and wine entrepreneur Gary Vaynerchuk says anyone can turn what they’re absolutely passionate about into a successful business venture. This summary aims to take you from the drudgery of an unloved job to being &#39;pumped up’ for work every morning. Pick your passion and become an expert. Do the research and make sure you know everything there is to know about your chosen field.  Create great content and be authentic.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Then it’s all about harnessing the power of the World Wide Web. Vaynerchuk says this is the key - not only to success but also to the advertising dollar. Build a website, set up a blog and use the huge number of social networking forums to get your message out there. The internet can massively and quickly increase your visibility and the more hits you get the more advertising money you can pitch for. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Of course none of this will happen without the ability to hustle; that’s how you get the advertisers interested and keep them that way. But, now your work is your passion - so as Vaynerchuk says that shouldn’t be a problem." />
