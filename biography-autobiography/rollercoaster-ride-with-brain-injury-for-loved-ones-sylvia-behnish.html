  <title>Rollercoaster Ride with Brain Injury (For Loved Ones) - Sylvia Behnish</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; A Rollercoaster Ride With Brain Injury (For Loved Ones) has been written to assist those who are experiencing a similar tragedy to realize they are not alone.  By reading my story it will help them adjust to the monumental changes in their life and that of their injured family member. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
They will learn that it is sometimes two steps forward and one step back. In the days ahead; they will learn not to take things personally if their brain injured loved one becomes angry or verbally abusive and they will discover the importance of setting boundaries. As well, it is important not to feel guilty if they wish time for themselves or if they occasionally feel frustrated; their life has changed also. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Initially the most crucial things to do are to ask the right questions; take control of the situation; be proactive; be their own advocate for their injured family member and realize the necessity of having support.  These are vital when battling cognitive and behavioral problems, frustration and anger management difficulties, confusion and short-term memory loss as well as other brain injury impairments.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Included with my story are sample cognitive exercises that we used at an early stage in Larry&#39;s development which helped immensely in his progress towards recovery.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
As time goes on they will learn that there are adaptations and adjustments that will be necessary to make for their new life.  There will also be many bumps in the road.  
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Any road that is not travelled alone makes the trip much easier.  By reading Rollercoaster Ride With Brain Injury (For Loved Ones), the reader will realize they are not alone; many others have travelled the road before them.
