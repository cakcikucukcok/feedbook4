  <title>Becoming Something: The Story of Canada Lee - Mona Z. Smith</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The first biography of the great black actor, activist, athlete--and tragic victim of the blacklist&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Imagine an actor as familiar to audiences as Denzel Washington and Morgan Freeman are today--who is then virtually deleted from public memory. Such is the story of Canada Lee. Among the most respected black actors of the forties and a tireless civil rights advocate, Lee was unjustly dishonored, his name reduced to a footnote in the history of the McCarthy era, his death one of a handful directly attributable to the blacklist.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Born in Harlem in 1907, Lee was a Renaissance man. A musical prodigy on violin and piano at eleven, by thirteen he had become a successful jockey and by his twenties a champion boxer. After wandering into auditions for the WPA Negro Theater Project, Lee took up acting and soon shot to stardom in Orson Welles&#39;s Broadway production of &lt;i&gt;Native Son&lt;/i&gt;, later appearing in such classic films as &lt;i&gt;Lifeboat&lt;/i&gt; and the original &lt;i&gt;Cry, the Beloved Country&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Lee&#39;s meteoric rise to fame was followed by a devastating fall. Labeled a Communist by the FBI and HUAC as early as 1943, Lee was pilloried during the notorious spy trial of Judith Coplon in 1949, then condemned in longtime friend Ed Sullivan&#39;s column. He died in 1952, forty-five and penniless, a heartbroken casualty of a dangerous and conflicted time. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, after nearly a decade of research, Mona Z. Smith revives the legacy of a man who was perhaps the blacklist&#39;s most tragic victim.&lt;/p&gt;" />
