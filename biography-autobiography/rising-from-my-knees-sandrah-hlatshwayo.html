  <title>Rising from My Knees - Sandrah Hlatshwayo</title>
      <meta name="description" content="My book is a memoir based on my life experiences and how I have overcome lifes challenges as a single mother, as a student, and living with my daughter in a single-parent home with my five brothers.
The aim of the book is to motivate and inspire teen mummies to pursue their dreams and achieve their goals, no matter what circumstances they are in. I truly believe that, with hard work and dedication, dreams do come true.
The book has fifty-one chapters and poems based on my thoughts and fears of failing in life, which makes it okay. In the end, I must say that I have lived my life!
This book will inspire my readers to appreciate life and to cherish all that surrounds them with passion by letting the past go and reaching to the future with a purpose." />
