  <title>The Dog Who Ate the Truffle - Suzanne Carreiro</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;B&gt;&lt;I&gt;An authentic culinary journey--part memoir, part cookbook--introducing readers to the people, places, and food of Umbria &lt;/I&gt;&lt;/B&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;B&gt;&lt;I&gt;&lt;/I&gt;&lt;/B&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;B&gt;&lt;I&gt;&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/I&gt;Veteran food critic Suzanne Carriero spent a year and a half in Umbria, and this is her intimate look at its ancient recipes, traditions, and the people who pass them on. Each of the book&#39;s eight chapters features local cooks, as their personal stories are as much a part of the cuisine&#39;s essence as are the crops they grow and the family dishes they prepare. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anecdotes, sidebars, and boxes are used throughout the book to further illustrate Umbrian life--from buying a rabbit in the country, to making torta di Pasqua for Easter, to reading the Italian wine label, and drinking cappuccino after lunch (a serious breach in tradition). With a food and wine glossary included as a reference for travelers, &lt;I&gt;The Dog Who Ate the Truffle &lt;/I&gt;immerses the reader in the people, cuisine, and lifestyle that few are privileged to experience. Suzanne&#39;s colorful stories and authentic classic recipes make for an intimate and illustrious travel cookbook.&lt;/p&gt;" />
