  <title>Magic and Miracles - Linda K. Reed</title>
      <meta name="description" content="When Lindas husband, Phil, died, something happened inside of her.
Shattered beyond anything that she had ever known, she could not eat, thinkand at timesshe could not breathe. She didnt know it at the time, but something inside her was changing.
Something divine and unknown had entered Lindas life, and she set out on a journey searching for answers to her questions. Her trip led her to an amazing medium, Roxie, who helped her communicate with her late spouse.
It was a turning point that led her into a metaphysical world that toppled her belief system. Burying herself in science and quantum physics, doors blew open, and she courageously walked through them.
Crossing the threshold took Linda to places she never dreamed, and as she traveled a path toward the unknown, angels tapped at her heart and bathed her with light.
Join Linda as she celebrates spiritual growth and the unexpected gifts that helped her realize that there is something greater than just this life." />
