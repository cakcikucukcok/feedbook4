  <title>Life in the Harsh Lane - Thomas Appleby</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This book is intended to make any reader, firstly laugh, then in no particular order, flinch, be jealous, feel sick, feel sorry, angry and disgusted or just plain sad.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
This is the original story of nobodies, but the type of people a lot of people can relate to, to some degree. Events are sometimes in random order, due to the author&#39;s sometimes random memory.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
The main dilemma in writing a &#39;warts n&#39; all&#39; book, is, whilst it&#39;s fine to do so if you are famous, on the other hand, when even your wife can barely remember who you are, it&#39;s a bit different! Basically, who gives a shit? But going with the old clich &#39;Everyone has a book in them&#39; here&#39;s mine. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
It is a book of many contrasts, wild and excessive and funny to some, but at some points it is balanced out with the tales of the complete opposite, about family, heartbreak and loss, and has some pretty morbid moments I must admit, but this is generally about the knowledge that you gain in this life, I can&#39;t say I have learned completely yet, who does? But I&#39;m getting there, and if I don&#39;t, who really gives a toss anyway? I didn&#39;t invent Penicillin, or The Wheel, or even American Idol, I&#39;m just a regular guy in some respects. There is a great quote  out there which that wholeheartedly sums up my philosophy towards life, &#39;Live as if you&#39;ll die tomorrow. Dream as if you&#39;ll live forever.&#39; &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
There is also a historical element to some of the recollections, relating to people and places, just to try to make me look a bit more clever if possible, well I need something! As for writing about real life, as a musician formerly, I now understand when a band says you have your have the first part of your life to  write your first album, it&#39;s the same with writing about real life, all your own experiences are exhausted after that. As anyone who knows me, I&#39;m one of the worst liars in the universe, imagination I&#39;m crap at, I do prefer real life. So I won&#39;t be forging a career in Fiction anytime soon. Anyway, it&#39;s all academic, I&#39;ll probably get banned from writing books ever again, if anybody ever reads this. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Names have been changed to protect the slightly guilty, the guilty, and the really guilty, I hope I&#39;ve not dropped anyone in this too much. There are certain stories which I cannot and will not write about, too sensitive for some people I know, and are frankly a bit too harsh for this book, and that&#39;s saying something." />
