  <title>Eternal - Gladstone Matthew</title>
      <meta name="description" content="In the year 2007, my father was dying and he wanted to see me. I did see him before he died. For the first time, we had a father-and-son talk. It was good. His face was childlike with his eyes wide open. He wanted us to take a walk in the garden, but I said, Its okay dad, sit down. At that time, I truly knew what forgiveness was.   I asked him,  Dad, do you remember 1972 when we were in London England? He quickly said,  No. Fear was on his face. I never told my dad about Freestan.  With the help of God I forgave Freestan a long time ago.  The struggle between my father and I was a mighty one.  A young boy was almost destroyed by his father. However, the bible helped my soul and the gospels made me strong. The voice of God was my only hope." />
