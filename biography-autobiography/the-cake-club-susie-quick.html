  <title>The Cake Club - Susie Quick</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Hardworking. Loyal. Outspoken. Ahead of their time. Hilarious. The &quot;Fancy Frosters&quot; of Charleston, West Virginia, were a close-knit and devoted circle - a merry band of Southern women who got together once a month to swap recipes and stories, to cook and bake together, to celebrate friendship and have some hearty laughs...and of course to eat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Food editor and cookbook author Susie Quick&#39;s mother Emma was a member of this very special circle of sisters, aunts, cousins, and friends. Susie grew up to be a sophisticated &quot;foodie,&quot; but she never forgot the great homemade desserts and ingenious creativity of these talented and delightful home cooks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Cake Club&lt;/i&gt; collects their most prized recipes for southern desserts, along with those of Susie&#39;s other colorful friends and relatives - all presented with their original homespun flair combined with the author&#39;s modern simplicity and style. The book includes seventy-five recipes for cakes, pies, cobblers, crumbles, cookies, candies, and other treats, plus a chapter of &quot;Lady Food&quot; that&#39;s sure to make a lady out of any cook.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From the very first recipe (&quot;Funeral Cake&quot;) to Brown Sugar Pound Cake, Tunnel of Love Chocolate Macaroon Bundt Cake, Blackberry Bread Pudding, Emma&#39;s Molasses Crinkles, Minnie Pearl&#39;s Chess Pie, and the other treasured creations in this book, The Cake Club will entertain, inspire, and bring back memories of an earlier era. With stories like &quot;A Good Man Really is Hard to Find&quot; and &quot;Driving Miss Minnie,&quot; photographs, and voices from several generations, this unique and delightful cookbook pays tribute to the healing power of friendship, shared recipes, and a delicious piece of cake.&lt;/p&gt;" />
