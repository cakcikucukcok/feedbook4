      <meta name="description" content="This is a story about a former US marine returning to the continent of Asia for a third time.
Gracefully, on his third tour to the largest area on Earth, he traveled alone without the thousand plus men of the strong infantry battalion of 3/5. His third journey there was different; it was about love. On a small island just southeast of the country of India dwelt the most beautiful woman his eyes could ever behold. Sri Lanka was a place very far and different from where he had come. However, love conquered all as the two continued to dwell in love, despite of the immigration difficulties." />
