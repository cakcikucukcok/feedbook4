  <title>Had I Known - Joan Lunden</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;In this brave and deeply personal memoir, one of America&amp;#8217;s most beloved journalists, mother, and &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; bestselling author speaks candidly about her battle against breast cancer, her quest to learn about it and teach others, and the transformative effect it&amp;#8217;s had on her life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When former &lt;em&gt;Good Morning America&lt;/em&gt; host Joan Lunden was diagnosed with breast cancer, she set out to learn everything about it to help her survive. With seven children counting on her, giving up was not an option. After announcing her diagnosis on &lt;em&gt;Good Morning America,&lt;/em&gt; people all over the country rallied around Joan as she went into Warrior mode. Within a few months, after losing her hair, Joan appeared on the cover of &lt;em&gt;People&lt;/em&gt; magazine bald, showing the world she could, and would, beat the disease. Determined to remain upbeat&amp;#8212;to look in the mirror with a brave face&amp;#8212;her resolve empowered women everywhere. The &lt;em&gt;Today&lt;/em&gt; show quickly recruited Joan as a special correspondent and continues to follow her progress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A deeply personal and powerful story of pain, persistence, and perseverance, &lt;em&gt;Had I Known&lt;/em&gt; is a chronicle of Joan&amp;#8217;s experience and the plan she formulated and followed to battle with her disease and treatment. As Joan reveals, while her journey was not easy, it profoundly changed her in unexpected ways. Her odyssey helped Joan redefine herself, her values, and most of all, her health. Following a new clean way of eating, Joan lost thirty pounds, became more aware of the food she was eating, and avoided many of the debilitating side effects of chemotherapy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dealing with the cancer also changed her perception of true beauty. Being attractive isn&amp;#8217;t about the hair on your head&amp;#8212;it&amp;#8217;s about the strength and character you bring to everything you do. Positive yet down-to-earth, told with piercing honesty leavened with warmth and humor, &lt;em&gt;Had I Known&lt;/em&gt; offers unforgettable, inspirational lessons for us all.&lt;/p&gt;" />
