  <title>Between Breaths - Elizabeth Vargas</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;b&gt;Beloved former ABC &lt;i&gt;20/20&lt;/i&gt; anchor Elizabeth Vargas reveals her alcohol addiction and anxiety disorder in a shockingly honest and emotional memoir. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; From the moment she uttered the brave and honest words, &quot;I am an alcoholic,&quot; to interviewer George Stephanopoulos, Elizabeth Vargas began writing her story, as her experiences were still raw.  Now, in &lt;i&gt;Between Breaths&lt;/i&gt;, Vargas discusses her accounts of growing up with anxiety--which began suddenly at the age of six when her father served in Vietnam--and how she dealt with this anxiety as she came of age, eventually turning to alcohol for a release from her painful reality. The now-A&amp;E Network reporter reveals how she found herself living in denial about the extent of her addiction, and how she kept her dependency a secret for so long. She addresses her time in rehab, her first year of sobriety, and the guilt she felt as a working mother who could never find the right balance between a career and parenting.  Honest and hopeful, Between Breaths is an inspiring read.  Winner of the Books for a Better Life Award in the First Book category  Instant &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;USA Today&lt;/i&gt; Bestseller" />
