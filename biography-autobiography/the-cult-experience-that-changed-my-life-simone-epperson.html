  <title>The Cult Experience That Changed My Life - Simone Epperson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Cult Experience That Changed My Life&lt;/i&gt; shares the harrowing story of a young womans experiences of being manipulated and controlled by a pastor who she believed had her best interests at heartand of her journey to freedom. Author Simone Epperson talks about the mistreatment she suffered while being part of this pastors church for twelve years. She details the abuse and manipulation that she faced while believing that she was in the best place she could be.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;She explains that what opened her eyes was the love of her family and friends and watching documentaries about Jim Jones and other cult leaders. Through her memoir, she seeks to educate people about spiritual abuse that has gone on for many years and need to be stopped now. Many peoples lives have been destroyed by this evil act. When people come into a church, they come to understand and accept the Word of God, to be healed from brokenness, and to learn how to live a clean and righteous life. Once a man or woman of the cloth betrays that trust, it can hurt a child of God for the rest of their lives.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Cult Experience That Changed My Life&lt;/i&gt; offers enlightenment through Simones personal testimony and can help you to understand the dangers of spiritual abuse.&lt;/P&gt;" />
