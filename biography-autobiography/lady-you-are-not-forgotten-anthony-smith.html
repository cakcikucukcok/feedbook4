  <title>Lady You Are Not Forgotten - Anthony Smith</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The story you have just read is true. The town of Derby, Connecticut, exists. The places in the story exist. The people are real, and their gifts to John Conway will never be forgotten, neither will his love for all. He used their names to assure that. Nancy is real and is his wife still. His daughter Alicia is real, and she and her husband gave him a gifta little girl named Karina. They are all together now enjoying the life given to them. The Great Spirit exists in many by different names and religion, but the message is all the samelove. Man has created a lot of rules and laws. He, as I believe, created tenten of the simplest and easiest things to follow. John tries to follow them throughout his life. No preaching, just by showing example. There is no big church, just what has been given to us. And he listens. He told his friends their gifts and thanked all who are still alive and those that have passed. He is sure they know. How do I know this about John?" />
