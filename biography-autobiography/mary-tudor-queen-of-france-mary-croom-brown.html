  <title>Mary Tudor, Queen of France - Mary Croom Brown</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Mary Croom Brown&amp;acute;s &amp;quot;Mary Tudor, Queen of France&amp;quot; narrates the fascinating story of Mary Tudor, the third daughter of Henry VII of England and Elizabeth of York and the younger sister of King Henry VIII, who was Queen of France. Mary became the third wife of Louis XII of France, more than 30 years her senior. Following his death, she married Charles Brandon, 1st Duke of Suffolk. The marriage, which was performed secretly in France, took place without her brother&amp;#39;s consent. This necessitated the intervention of Thomas Wolsey and the couple were eventually pardoned by Henry VIII, although they were forced to pay a large fine.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Mary&amp;#39;s second marriage produced four children; and through her eldest daughter Frances, Mary was the maternal grandmother of Lady Jane Grey, who was the de facto monarch of England for a little over a week in July 1553.&amp;nbsp;" />
