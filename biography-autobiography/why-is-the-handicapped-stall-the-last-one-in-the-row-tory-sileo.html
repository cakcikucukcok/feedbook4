  <title>Why Is the Handicapped Stall the Last One in the Row? - Tory Sileo</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Tory Sileo is candid and honest in sharing her fears and horrors as a result of the progression of her life-sentence disease.  Her good days and bad days, her falls and inability to get up again are sincere and frank. As a disabled person with walking difficulties, she was astonished to discover that the handicapped lavatory stall equipped with grab bars in public venues were only provided in one stall and that stall was the last in the row of stalls.  How is the last one, another five-ten feet away from the entry door, designed for patrons with disabilities of any sort?   
This journal is the first in a series of discoveries that this author encounters as she travels through life as a handicapped person.  Her straightforward sense of writing is sincere and direct with a fresh approach that captures the reader from the very beginning.  A portion of the proceeds of this and future pieces of work by this author will be donated to the Multiple Sclerosis Foundation." />
