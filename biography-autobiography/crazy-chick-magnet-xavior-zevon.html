      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Xavior Zevon&#39;s book &lt;em&gt;Crazy Chick Magnet &lt;/em&gt;sees him getting a rough start at life as a nerdy kid with awkward tendencies and a bowl haircut to boot. At the time, all he wanted was the love and affection of the opposite sex. However, it looked like it would never happen, so for a while, he invested his time and money into music, which became a very defining moment in his life. In the process, he became a bit of an expert in his music knowledge (more specifically rock music). Eventually though, he came into his own and developed an arsenal of interesting stories with the opposite sex. &lt;em&gt;Crazy Chick Magnet &lt;/em&gt;blends his stories of love and love lost with a plethora of sexual encounters and it is all threaded together in a tapestry of music that spans the decades. Xavior&#39;s book incorporates music as a character itself as the soundtrack changes throughout each chapter. Every word is authentic. His accounts will take you through a journey that you are likely not to forget. It is a book that will certainly evoke some laughs, some tears, maybe a little disbelief, and hopefully on occasion it will stimulate your fun parts. So, if you like books about music, sex, life, relationships, and dating you are sure to find a great read in Xavior Zevon&#39;s erotic nonfiction, &lt;em&gt;Crazy Chick Magnet&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;" />
