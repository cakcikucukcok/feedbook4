  <title>Daughters of Destiny - Sharon Moran</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Throughout the centuries there have been Amazing American Women; women who rose on their strength of character, who overcame incredible obstacles to become outstanding in their own right. Women have created works of art and literature, founded businesses, fought in wars, led political and social movements, taught and inspired students, initiated social reforms and made discoveries in the sciences. Through their achievements they have become inspirations to generations of other women.&lt;br&gt;  	Daughters of Destiny presents dramatic monologues of four of these amazing women, four who forged the way for others to follow. Performing these living biographies, the actress takes her audience on each womans journey to become memorable and remarkable people in their own right.. With stories and anecdotes from childhood through adult life, each woman speaks of the trials and tribulations that led to fame and recognition.  Martha Washington withstood many personal tragedies to persevere and serve as a welcomed aid to the army during the Revolutionary War.  Mary Todd Lincoln tolerated rumor and gossip to forward the career of the man she believed was destined for greatness.  Sojourner Truth, a northern slave, overcame unspeakable hardships to rise as a prominent speaker for civil rights and Nellie Bly, through sheer determination and courage, became Americas first famous female newspaper reporter. These women possessed a determined spirit that will inspire all who hear their stories.  &lt;br&gt;
 	Daughters of Destiny offers an opportunity to todays actress to perform dramatic monologues of real-life unforgettable women and to personify our past in an exciting  entertaining format. These monologues can be used for performance in acting classes and as audition pieces. They can also be presented to young and adult audiences alike, creating an absorbing theatrical experience. Stage settings and props can be kept to a minimum thus making Daughters of Destiny easy to produce for any audience. The power of these dramatic monologues lies in the convincing true-to-life portrayals of each Amazing American Woman.&lt;br&gt;" />
