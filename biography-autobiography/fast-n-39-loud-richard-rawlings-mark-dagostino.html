  <title>Fast N&#39; Loud - Richard Rawlings, Mark Dagostino</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The breakout star of Discovery&amp;#8217;s hit automotive restoration show Fast N&amp;#8217; Loud takes readers on an entertaining ride through his wild life and behind the scenes of his hit show in this memoir and automotive handbook, revving with outrageous details and jaw-dropping stories, and injected with the quick-witted, foul-mouthed charm viewers love.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;#8220;If we&amp;#8217;re gonna have fun, it better have a motor!&amp;#8221;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In &lt;em&gt;Fast N&amp;#8217; Loud&lt;/em&gt;, Richard Rawlings pushes into high gear, sharing the story of his rise to success, his show, and the automotive know-how that has made him famous. He begins with his own story&amp;#8212;how he went from flat broke to a seat at the table with some of history&amp;#8217;s most iconic car guys. His road to the top is full of dangerous twists and hilarious turns, with a few precipitous cliffs in between, including getting shot defending his beloved 1965 Mustang fastback from carjackers, blowing out of town Fear-and-Loathing style, and picking up chicks and vagrants along the way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rawlings then takes readers behind the scenes of &lt;em&gt;Fast N&amp;#8217; Loud&lt;/em&gt;, the series, sharing details on everything from the toughest car to restore to the easiest, his favorite restorations, travel and war anecdotes, and the best and worst cars to make it to the small screen. He finishes with a handy guide for classic and antique car enthusiasts that includes insider tricks of the trade. Want to know how to find a Model-T in mint condition? Need a carburetor for your &amp;#8217;73 Ford Mustang? Want to meet other &amp;#8217;60s Porsche owners? The answers are all here.&lt;/p&gt;" />
