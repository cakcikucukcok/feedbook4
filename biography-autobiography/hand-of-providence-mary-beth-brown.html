  <title>Hand of Providence - Mary Beth Brown</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Public opinion polls, Ronald Reagan is the most popular of modern presidents, and yet to most biographers the man is still an enigma. This is because, as Brown explains, few have ever focused on this great man&#39;s faith. This book explores the life and personality of Ronald Reagan by focusing on his deep-felt Christian beliefs and showing how faith guided him along his distinguished career and led him to his unprecedented success. With the support of Ronald Reagan&#39;s own words and writings and firsthand interviews with Ronald Reagan&#39;s family, friends, and co-workers, Brown weaves a magnificent story of Reagan&#39;s strong devotion to God that will not only inspire Christians to enter public service and allow their faith to motivate all their actions but also help point others to the Cross of Jesus Christ-a cause that was near and dear to President Reagan&#39;s heart.&lt;/p&gt;" />
