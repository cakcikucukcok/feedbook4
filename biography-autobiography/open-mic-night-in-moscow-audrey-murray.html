  <title>Open Mic Night in Moscow - Audrey Murray</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The raucous and surprisingly poignant story of a young, Russia-obsessed American writer and comedian who embarked on a solo tour of the former Soviet Republics, never imagining that it would involve kidnappers, garbage bags of money, and encounters with the weird and wonderful from Mongolia to Tajikistan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kazakhstan, Belarus, and Siberia are not the typical tourist destinations of a twenty-something, nor the places one usually goes to eat, pray, and/or love. But the mix of imperial Russian opulence and Soviet decay, and the allure of emotionally unavailable Russian men proved strangely irresistible to comedian Audrey Murray.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At age twenty-eight, while her friends were settling into corporate jobs and serious relationships, Audrey was on a one-way flight to Kazakhstan, the first leg of a nine-month solo voyage through the former USSR. A blend of memoir and offbeat travel guide, this thoughtful, hilarious catalog of a young comedian&amp;#8217;s adventures is also a diary of her emotional discoveries about home, love, patriotism, loneliness, and independence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sometimes surprising, often disconcerting, and always entertaining, &lt;em&gt;Open Mic Night in Moscow&lt;/em&gt; will inspire you to take the leap and embark on your own journey into the unknown. And, if you want to visit Chernobyl by way of an insane-asylum-themed bar in Kiev, Audrey can assure you that there&amp;#8217;s no other guidebook out there. (She&amp;#8217;s looked.)&lt;/p&gt;" />
