  <title>Fast Eddie - Eddie Maher</title>
      <meta name="description" content="9.30am on 22 January 1993. The moment in crime history that one of Britain&#39;s most audacious thefts ever took place and the legend of &#39;Fast Eddie&#39; was created.
This is the story of how Securicor guard Eddie Maher managed to pull off a £1.2 million heist, fled the country despite every port being closed, spawned an international manhunt, and managed to evade capture for 20 years. As Britain&#39;s Most Wanted Man, he led 30 detectives, FBI and Interpol on a wild goose chase across the USA.
Dubbed &#39;Fast Eddie&#39; by the press, he was always one step ahead and after two decades on the run with his family using a series of of aliases and identities, Eddie began to think he&#39;d committed the perfect crime until a cruel and dramatic betrayal proved otherwise...
Like a Hollywood movie script and told in full for the first time, Fast Eddie is the compelling story of how an ordinary British man became America&#39;s most notorious fugitive." />
