      <meta name="description" content="I love your book! It should be required reading for every twenty year old,
as a way to look at life and learn how to move forward with whatever comes.
Its truly beautiful in spirit and well-written too!
Linda Joy Myers, President of the National Association of Memoir Writers
This memoir is a primer in how to be happy. Its a story about a woman
who encountered marriage and family issuesmore than her shareand confronted them with
resourcefulness, faith, and a generosity of spirit that inspires everyone who knows her. Jeanne Fobes
memoir should be required reading for all of us.
Dawn Thurston, author of Breathe Life into Your Life Story: How to Write a Story People Will Want
to Read (Signature Books, 2007).
Jeannes memoir, Struck by Joy, is a book to be read and re-read and treasured for future generations.
You will follow Jeannes zig zag path to a place of joy, and become able, yourself, to enjoy the wonder
of being alive. Its not about power and politics; its about love and joy. Read it and remember its
message.
Martha Sarkissian, author of Living On a Fault
I have read your memoir with delight and with admiration for your writing skills. Your story brims
with goodness and optimism and humor. You have survived difficult adjustments with resilience
and with your faith in humanity intact. You have made your story interesting and readableI like
your character-drawing, especially of your beloved family.
You have succeeded admirably in leaving a true, characteristic, positive, lively, loving memory of
your life, and your parents lives, and your childrens childhood.
