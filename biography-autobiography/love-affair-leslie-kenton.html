  <title>Love Affair - Leslie Kenton</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;B&gt;&lt;I&gt;A searing literary memoir of a disconnected childhood, a multigenerational upbringing and incest-- from the daughter of legendary jazz pianist Stan Kenton &lt;/I&gt;&lt;/B&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;B&gt;&lt;I&gt;&lt;/I&gt;&lt;/B&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;B&gt;&lt;I&gt;&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/I&gt;Leslie Kenton was the only child of Violet, a stunning Hitchcock blonde, and the legendary jazz giant Stan Kenton. The story takes place on the road in 1950s America and in the mania of Hollywood--a world of jazz clubs, dance halls and onenighters, where lives were lived on a razor&#39;s edge. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;I&gt;Love Affair &lt;/I&gt;takes us beyond the bright lights and glamour into an intense, claustrophobic world of a father and the only child of his troubled marriage. As Stanley grapples with alcohol and his personal demons, gradually his actions threaten to destroy the only real, untainted thing in his life: Leslie. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A true story of obsession, tragedy and grace, &lt;I&gt;Love Affair &lt;/I&gt;is Leslie Kenton&#39;s powerful memoir. At its heart is the complex, ultimately incestuous, relationship with her father-a union so powerful it defines all that came after. As their lives become increasingly entangled, so do the forces of darkness and light that exist within us all, leading to destruction for him and heartbreaking redemption for her. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There have been memoirs about incest before, but &lt;I&gt;Love Affair &lt;/I&gt;is a surprisingly moving and elegant treatment of a young life, shared passion, and boundaries crossed.&lt;/p&gt;" />
