  <title>Seasons of the Soul - Cynthia Redfern</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Born in the midst of the London Blitz in 1940, &lt;b&gt;Cynthia Redfern&lt;/b&gt; came of age in post-war Britain. Here she learned the value of independence, hard work, friendship, and family. They would all contribute to each season of her life.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Full of vivid detail, &lt;i&gt;Seasons of the Soul&lt;/i&gt; shares Cynthias unusual life story. Even though the road was often rocky and some seasons offered more challenges than others, Cynthias determination to keep her integrity intact saw her through. In an easy, conversational style, she relates her childhood years, remembering her grandfather, the boy she befriended at age six (a friendship that lasted sixty-four years), and the house she lived in for nearly twenty years.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;With unflinching candor, Cynthia describes her loss of innocence as she was sexually abused for three years by a much older boy, a tragedy that would forever affect her. She describes her life as a teenager; her travels through Europe; her early relationships; her marriage to her husband, David; and their subsequent move to Canada. As the years passed, Cynthia became a mother, a farm wife, an entrepreneur, and, eventually, a grandmother. Each season provided its share of joys and challenges, molding her into the person she is today.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Inspiring and heartwarming, this memoir tells a story of courage and commitment to living the best life possible.&lt;/p&gt;" />
