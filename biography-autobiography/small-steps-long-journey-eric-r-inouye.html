  <title>Small Steps, Long Journey - Eric R. Inouye</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p align=&quot;justify&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Small Steps - Long Journey&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;, is an autobiography novel that depicts my struggle to survive a nine-week coma and overcome the dependency of others. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; In August 1985, a drunk driver torpedoed through his red light and blasted into my smaller mini truck. Instantly, i fell comatose for nine weeks, but the real story is in my tenacity to overcome obstacles in my life that were not there before.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As an athlete through school, I succumbed to a life far different than the playing field. Faced with difficulties that were taken for granted, suddenly my world became a battlefield just to survive. I take the reader on a voyage into the unknown disabled community, where I candidly express my emotions. The accident left me vulnerable, which allowed my father in close. We were both too stubborn to show weakness and that kept us apart. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; My hopes are to share my story and inspire those who are injured everyday, whether it is doctors &amp; nurses or families &amp; friends of those who recewive care. I take the reader on  ajourney where hopefully you can find comfort in one persons survival.&lt;/p&gt;" />
