  <title>Wayne Rooney: Always a Blue - The Biography - Ian Macleay</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Wayne Rooney, England&#39;s record goal scorer, is one of the most feared and respected strikers to have graced the Premier League in the last decade. He is certainly its most famous icon, appearing on the front pages of the newspapers nearly as often as on the back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wayne started his glittering career as a teenage wonder at Everton, the club he had staunchly supported as a boy. A self-confessed and fiercely passionate blue-blood, Rooney was raised in Croxteth, a product of the rough district just outside the shadow of Goodison Park. After a white-hot start, the teenager joined regional rivals, Manchester United, in a seismic transfer and, in his deeply successful time at Old Trafford, won sixteen major honours, played in three World Cups, married his childhood sweetheart and began a young family, throwing off his reputation as the gifted &#39;wild-child&#39; of English football.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet, in the summer of 2017, the prodigal son returned to his first club, providing Evertonians with a sense of pride and football fans everywhere with a classic narrative. His warm reception made it clear that Rooney still has a special place in the hearts of Toffees fans, and the saga embodies the pride and passion that has propelled the Premier League to become the most exciting - and profitable - in the world.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Told by veteran football writer Ian MacLeay, this is the definitive story of Rooney&#39;s explosive, emotive and turbulent return to Everton Football Club, and the historic season which followed.&lt;/p&gt;" />
