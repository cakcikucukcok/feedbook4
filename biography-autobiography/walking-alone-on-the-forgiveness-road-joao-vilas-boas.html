  <title>Walking Alone On the Forgiveness Road - Joao Vilas-Boas</title>
      <meta name="description" content="For over 30 years, Joao Vilas-Boas battled against racial discrimination in Brazil just to bring to the world a tale of a never-ending living saga. Human rights completely violated while he struggled to survive at working for big companies like PwC and IBM, is just a glimpse of this real story and &quot;Never Surrender&quot;, the main plot. Though fighting as a warrior, he hopelessly looked for Justice everywhere even in the religions he attended since he was a kid. As time passed by, he realized that his efforts had been fruitless and that he would not survive in the country with his family; then the Vilas-Boas took the hard decision to escape to the United States, where they are living until today. This is not only a biopic but also lessons learned from a life that, if put into a screenplay, it would be a shocking, revealing, breathtaking Hollywood drama movie. His message is clear, simple: Do you want to move on with your own life? Yes!? Then go with him &quot;Walking Alone on The Forgiveness Road&quot;. Enjoy the journey!" />
