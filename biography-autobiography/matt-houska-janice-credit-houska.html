  <title>Matt Houska - Janice Credit Houska</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Matt&#39;s story begins where For the Love of Matthew leaves off.  Matt is seventeen at the beginning of the book, and ends when he is twenty-six years old.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
You will follow Matt&#39;s journey through the remainder of his high school years and into the work force. You will be there as he becomes a well sought after musician and as his talent grows from playing the piano, harmonica, guitar and xylophone to mastering the saxophone, drums and consantina. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
You will feel the anguish that follows when he loses his beloved grandfather, two aunts and several favorite pets. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
You will feel the frustration when his speech diminishes and although many things are done to help, little changes.  In spite of this problem, he manages to hold down two jobs and perform his music in many venues. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Matthew awards and tributes will astound you as he grows in his abilities to work and become a celebrated member of society.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
When Matt is ready to go out on his own, there is much drama that goes along with making that decision and what Matt as well as his parents go through to overcome feelings of sadness and loneliness and turn those feelings into gratification and deep pride.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Matt Houska, Ability Not Disability takes the reader through what are possibly the most difficult times in a person&#39;s lifethe time of dependence to a state of independence.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;       
&lt;i&gt;&quot;The mother-child relationship is paradoxical and, is in a sense, tragic.  It requires the most intense love on the mother&#39;s side, yet this very love must help the child grow away from the mother and to become fully independent.&quot;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;
