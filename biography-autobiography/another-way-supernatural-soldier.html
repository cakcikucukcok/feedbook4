  <title>Another-Way - Supernatural Soldier</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This is the work of a national nonfiction masterpiece. The experiences, strength, and hope described herein are true events. The vivid memories of my family and friends have been modified as I remembered the situations to protect their anonymity. This is a national outreach to those who still suffer from abuse together we stand divided we fall. This is a true story of abuse awareness for victims to receive help in sexual, mental, and physical abuse. The story of triumph over abuse, alcoholism, and trauma are episodes about my life. I wrote this book through the eyes of an innocent young child being abused. The promises start to happen when the victim surrenders to the will of God nothing else worked. This material will help people build a foundation of willingness to conquer abuse through the powerful medicine of Gods forgiveness. The road to freedom for the victims of abuse expressed in this work starts with assimilating the trauma, and identifying the problem. This book allows people to see the power of God working in children so powerful that at a young age. I was able to hide the trauma better than being a grown up trying to survive. I just want people to know that they are not alone in their suffering and trauma. We can survive together even though I may not know who they are this message is for those who still suffer." />
