  <title>What in the World Are You Doing with Cancer? - Hannah McGinnis</title>

&lt;p&gt;Cancer? Dont only old people and little kids get cancer? How on earth did I get cancer?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thats what Hannah McGinnis thought when she found out she had Hodgkins lymphoma as a twenty-one-year-old college senior. She didnt qualify for aid, wigs, or wish-fulfillment programs like children under eighteen, but she didnt feel old enough to be lumped in with middle-aged women and men fighting cancer. She found herself in the prime of life, battling a formidable disease without warning and without resources for her situation in life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;em&gt;What in the World Are You Doing with Cancer?&lt;/em&gt;, McGinnis walks through her journey with the disease, from her diagnosis to the final treatment and her later reflections. She reveals her thoughts, fears, joys, and struggles with a touch of sarcasm along the way. Ultimately, though the diagnosis was both surreal and frightening, she found hope, a deeper purpose, and a faithful God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;McGinnis encourages uswhether we have cancer or notto remember that God is sovereign, to finish strong, and to find the eternal perspective in whatever unexpected trials we may face.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
