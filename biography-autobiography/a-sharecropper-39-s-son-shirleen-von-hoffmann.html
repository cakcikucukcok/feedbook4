  <title>A Sharecropper&#39;s Son - Shirleen Von Hoffmann</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This is the story of Ted (Roosevelt) Sullen, a Sharecroppers Son.  In the story of his life and upbringing, you learn that real American spirit comes in all packages. He overcame his tough upbringing in the rural south only to endure the horrors of Vietnam but never let any of it dampen his internal light. This book teaches you that there are Heroes walking among us every day, if we just take the time to look.
A touching and heartfelt story of a man who overcame many obstacles but didnt see it that way.  He kept moving forward with his entire heart and lived life to the fullest!  I loved this story! I am going to share this story with my four children because I want them to know how life was for some and how they can overcome anything in life and still succeed!

 A Sharecroppers Son is a celebration of enormous fortitude not only for Ted, but for the Author as well. Enlightening, poignant and compelling, Teds personal story of perseverance, touched my heart and reminded me why this life is worth living. He is an amazing man and a true champion, with a wonderful story to tell. Not only did this book capture my heart, but it will capture yours.

&quot;Ted&#39;s is a beautiful, amazing life story.   As much as I enjoyed the process, I turned each page with more and more inspiration drawn from his passion and compassion. He epitomizes selflessness. Right from the first chapter he looks beyond his circumstances with both inner-peace and strength.&quot;
