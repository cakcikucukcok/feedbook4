  <title>Beyond My Control - Suzan Collins</title>
      <meta name="description" content="With 33 years&#39; experience in health and social care, Suzan Collins believed she could ensure good care for her mother, and her family relied on her to do so. She was actually delivering training on best practice when she was first contacted with the news her mother had broken her leg at her nursing home and had been transferred to hospital. This is the story of what followed - the gradual revelation of a whole ongoing chain of poor care and bad practice that Suzan, with all her knowledge and experience of &#39;the system&#39; could not influence. In this highly topical book, Suzan shares her story from her personal and professional perspectives, and looks ahead to how we can all contribute to keeping vulnerable people in the health and social care system safe from harm." />
