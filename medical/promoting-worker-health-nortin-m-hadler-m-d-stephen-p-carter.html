  <title>Promoting Worker Health - Nortin M. Hadler, M.D., Stephen P. Carter</title>
      <meta name="description" content="In this extended essay, Nortin M. Hadler and Stephen P. Carter introduce a new approach to reforming the American health-care system--a plan they call the Universal Workers&#39; Compensation Model (UWCM). Drawing on Hadler&#39;s expertise as a physician and Carter&#39;s as an attorney, the two have conceived the UWCM as a state-level alternative that would supersede current solutions debated at the national level. They begin by summarizing the history and present complexity and irrationality of America&#39;s health-insurance system. They then lay out the key concepts underlying the UWCM regime and the practical policy steps necessary to enact it. At the heart of the UWCM is a broader understanding of what constitutes worker&#39;s health, one grounded in scientific research and cognizant of the wide range of physical and mental illnesses that can afflict workers. The UWCM stipulates a single policy providing rational and reasoned recourse for universal risks: illness, injury, disability, and death. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Presenting their ideas with precision in this 34-page pamphlet, Hadler and Carter intend to spark discussion among health-care providers, insurers, legislators, and everyday citizens about how we might move beyond the limits of the current debate toward new, truly effective solutions.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;" />
