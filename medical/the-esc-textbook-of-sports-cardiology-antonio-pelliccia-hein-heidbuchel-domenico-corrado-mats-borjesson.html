  <title>The ESC Textbook of Sports Cardiology - Antonio Pelliccia, Hein Heidbuchel, Domenico Corrado, Mats Borjesson...</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Sports and exercise have been intensely advocated as protective lifestyle measures which prevent or reduce the risk of severe health issues, including cardiovascular disease. More extreme forms of sports (for instance at high altitudes) have been identified as an important way of promoting cardiovascular adaptation, but have also been associated with adverse effects and even major cardiovascular events in predisposed individuals. Participating in more commonplace
sports and exercise, such as football, may also increase a person&#39;s risk of cardiac events. This publication is timely in the light of a burgeoning number of clinical papers in the field.
The ESC Textbook of Sports Cardiology provides an overview of the detection and treatment of cardiovascular disease in elite athletes and young sports professionals in training, as well as prevention. It will be useful for clinical cardiologists, sports physicians, and general physicians alike. Split into 11 key areas in sports cardiology, ranging from sudden cardiac death in athletes to the most common cardiovascular abnormalities seen in athletes, and to the effects of substance abuse and
doping, the text is an invaluable resource covering all aspects of sports cardiology.
Access to the digital version of the textbook is included with purchase of the printed version. Highly illustrated with embedded multimedia features, together with cross-referenced links to related content and primary research data in major journals in the field, the digital version provides users with a dynamic and forward-thinking resource.
The ESC Textbook of Sports Cardiology is the second textbook from the European Association of Preventive Cardiology (EAPC) and aligns with ESC clinical practice guidelines and EAPC recommendations and position papers." />
