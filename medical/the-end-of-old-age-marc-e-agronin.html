  <title>The End of Old Age - Marc E. Agronin</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;b&gt;The acclaimed author of &lt;i&gt;How We Age&lt;/i&gt;, whose &quot;descriptive powers are a gift to readers&quot; (Sherwin Nuland), presents a hopeful and practical model of aging--a guide to understanding how we can all make the journey better.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/b&gt;As one of America&#39;s leading geriatric psychiatrists, Dr. Marc Agronin sees both the sickest and the healthiest of seniors. He observes what works to make their lives better and more purposeful and what doesn&#39;t. Many authors can talk about aging from their particular vantage points, but Dr. Agronin is on the front lines as he counsels and treats elderly individuals and their loved ones on a daily basis. The latest scientific research and Dr. Agronin&#39;s first-hand experience are brilliantly distilled in &lt;i&gt;The End of Old Age&lt;/i&gt;--a call to no longer see aging as an implacable enemy and to start seeing it as a developmental force for enhancing well-being, meaning, and longevity.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Throughout &lt;i&gt;The End of Old Age&lt;/i&gt;, the focus is squarely on &quot;So what does this mean for me and my family?&quot; In the final part of the book, Dr. Agronin provides simple but revealing charts that you can fill out to identify, develop, and optimize &lt;i&gt;your &lt;/i&gt;unique age-given strengths. It&#39;s nothing short of an action plan to help you age better by improving how you value the aging process, guide yourself through stress, and find ways to creatively address change for the best possible experience and outcome.&lt;br&gt;" />
