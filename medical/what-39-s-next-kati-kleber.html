  <title>What&#39;s Next? - Kati Kleber</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Being a competent bedside nurse is not the end-all goal … it’s only the beginning.
The highly acclaimed author of Becoming Nursey: From Code Blues to Code Browns, How to Care for Your Patients and Yourself and Admit One: What You Must Know When Going to the Hospital – But No One Actually Tells You!, Kati Kleber, BSN, RN, CCRN, delivers provocative and candid answers to the basic questions about professional development that every nurse should know.
What’s Next? The Smart Nurse’s Guide to Your Dream Job will enable you to flip on the light switch for nursing professional development and turn that dark and unknown space into a brightly lit room—where you can pick and choose what you desire in order to further yourself both professionally and personally.
Many hospitals provide information about how to be a successful charge nurse, nurse mentor, and nurse preceptor, but they are typically higher-level-thinking tips and not practical, real advice.
What’s Next? The Smart Nurse’s Guide to Your Dream Job addresses these personal and professional options and goes into detail about some of the more practical advice for successfully evolving into a formal or informal nurse on your unit—from learning how to be an effective charge nurse to learning how to precept and mentor new nurses, and much more.
What’s Next? The Smart Nurse’s Guide to Your Dream Job also outlines and describes the importance of continuing education, professional organizations and certifications, shared governance, and how to handle negative people when you are trying to better yourself.
While most books about professional development are written for management-level nurses or people in non-clinical positions, What’s Next? The Smart Nurse’s Guide to Your Dream Job is specifically directed toward professional development from the practical point of view of a bedside nurse." />
