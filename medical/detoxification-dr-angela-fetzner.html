  <title>Detoxification - Dr. Angela Fetzner</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;b&gt;Detoxification – the removal of pollutants from the body – can look back on a long tradition.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
Since time immemorial, people have felt a wish to cleanse their bodies and souls at regular intervals and to rid them of needless and harmful ballast. This may be due to the instinctive feeling that purification is a great relief for body and soul and is also needed to maintain or regain health. At the same time, a thorough detoxification and cleansing of the body is a prerequisite for all deeper processes of healing.&lt;br/&gt;
Among other things, detoxification measures are used to activate the body’s powers of self-healing. Only by thoroughly removing pollutants can we remove the precondition for many ailments, letting body and soul recover.&lt;br/&gt;
This book describes all natural therapies which have proven to be effective in basic detoxification. These measures are down to earth, motivating and efficient and include medicinal plant therapy, homeopathy, Schuessler salts, specific cleansing of the organs of detoxification, water applications, wraps, reduction of stress, changes of diet and so on.&lt;br/&gt;
With the help of the detoxification cures here chosen and presented, you will soon regain your vitality, strength and zeal.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;b&gt;With kind regards from your pharmacist, Dr. Angela Fetzner&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;" />
