  <title>The First Episode of Psychosis: A Guide for Patients and Their Families - Michael T Compton, Beth Broussard</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The First Episode of Psychosis is the ideal book for patients experiencing the frightening and confusing initial episode of psychosis, which often occurs during late adolescence or early adulthood, and which affects nearly 3% of all people over the course of their lifetime. The book covers a range of disorders, focusing on primary psychotic disorders such as schizophrenia and schizophreniform disorder, clearly describing symptoms, early warning signs, and treatment--information that is essential for patients and families faced with the challenges posed by psychosis. The book also discusses psychiatric evaluation, healthy lifestyle choices, and the stigma often associated with mental illnesses. Worksheets allow readers to keep records of symptoms to facilitate communication with care providers, and an extensive glossary clarifies the dizzying array of terms used by medical professionals. Optimistic, practical, and recovery-oriented, The First Episode of Psychosis will help patients and their families to take an active, informed role in their care to ensure the best possible prognosis." />
