      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Truehart gives us a real inside peak at her work and the devotion and skills of those who work alongside her. But most important, she takes the scary out of hospice. She makes it clear that choosing hospice creates the best possible world for the dying and the people who love themthat terminal illness does not necessitate living every day as though it is your last. Rather hospice can create a world of possibilities for each and every day that is left to usjust like in real life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kay Degenhardt, KDI&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I was first diagnosed with Multiple Myeloma over three years ago, it had the face of my mortality on itI was blessed to come across a copy of Cathys manuscript of her lifes work in hospice [which] made me laugh while I cried, but more importantly, Cathys compassion and her patients courage gave me hope and inspiration when I needed it most. I recommend that anyoneread this!&lt;/p&gt;
