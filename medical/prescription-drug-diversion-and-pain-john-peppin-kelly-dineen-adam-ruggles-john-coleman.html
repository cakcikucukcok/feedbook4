  <title>Prescription Drug Diversion and Pain - John Peppin, Kelly Dineen, Adam Ruggles, John Coleman</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;em&gt;Prescription Drug Diversion and Pain&lt;/em&gt; provides an interdisciplinary overview of medications used to treat chronic pain, specifically the benefits and risks that are posed by long-term opioids use. These essential pain-relieving medications must be carefully managed to prevent serious side effects that may include physical dependence, addiction, and even death, which has led in recent years to increased attention on the development of alternative treatments for chronic pain. This book not only offers a single, comprehensive source for understanding the specialized field of the opioid crisis, but also addresses provocative topics including how pain drugs came to be regulated by the U.S. Government and the rarely-discussed aggressive marketing behind the spread of these drugs. Chapters are written by expert contributors from diverse backgrounds in medicine, psychiatry, pharmacy, nursing, health law, and ethics. &lt;em&gt;Prescription Drug Diversion and Pain&lt;/em&gt; is a must-read for healthcare professionals, caregivers, policy makers, regulatory officials, law enforcement, and those in the pharmaceutical industry seeking to address the current and future opioid crisis." />
