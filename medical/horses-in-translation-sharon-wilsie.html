  <title>Horses in Translation - Sharon Wilsie</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;With her landmark first book &lt;i&gt;Horse Speak&amp;#58; The Equine&amp;#150Human Translation Guide&lt;/i&gt;, trainer Sharon Wilsie upended conventional methods of human&amp;#150equine communication &amp;#40;using words and ropes, for example&amp;#41; with her clear classification of the language horses use with each other &amp;#40;body, breath, and intent&amp;#41;, as well as an unparalleled explanation of how we as humans can effectively mirror it. Learning to &amp;ldquo;listen&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;talk&amp;rdquo; to horses in their language, instead of expecting them to comprehend ours, is a milestone in the progressive philosophy of horsemanship, helping find positive solutions to behavior and training problems and ultimately leading to fewer misunderstandings between horses and humans.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In her much&amp;#150anticipated follow&amp;#150up, Wilsie uses true stories to relate examples of &amp;ldquo;problems&amp;rdquo; and how they were solved using Horse Speak. Her engaging narrative introduces readers to dozens of real&amp;#150life scenarios from different barns, various disciplines, and riders and handlers with contrasting experiences and backgrounds. Wilsie highlights her Horse Speak process, the clues that point to the best course of action, and the steps she takes to connect with horses that have shut down, grown confused, or become sulky or aggressive for any number of reasons. The result is a book full of incredible insight and exciting possibilities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;" />
