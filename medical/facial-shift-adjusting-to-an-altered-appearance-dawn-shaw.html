  <title>Facial Shift: Adjusting to an Altered Appearance - Dawn Shaw</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Your face, and your life, has been radically altered. Accident, military injury, medical condition...the result is the same. You are now having to confront the world with a &amp;quot;different&amp;quot; face, and understandably this has wrecked your self-image and undermined your confidence, leaving you with a thousand questions and concerns including:&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;ul&gt; 	&lt;li&gt;What should I do when people stare at me?&lt;/li&gt; 	&lt;li&gt;What are my medical options?&lt;/li&gt; 	&lt;li&gt;Wouldn&amp;#39;t it be easier if I just stayed home and didn&amp;#39;t go anywhere?&lt;/li&gt; 	&lt;li&gt;And most significantly, How will this physical change affect current and future relationships?&lt;/li&gt; 	&lt;li&gt;Will anyone ever be able to love me?&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt; In &lt;em&gt;Facial Shift,&lt;/em&gt; author Dawn Shaw addresses those questions and more. Dawn was born with a rare tumor, the removal of which left her face half-paralyzed. She has lived her entire life, nearly half a century, with a different face, yet has been able to lead a happy and productive life. She doesn&amp;#39;t allow her different face to stop her from interacting with the world, and joins the visible likes of Lizzie Velazquez, whose rare condition which doesn&amp;#39;t allow her to retain body fat once earned her the title of &amp;quot;ugliest woman on the internet,&amp;quot; and severely burned Iraq war veteran turned actor/author/speaker JR Martinez, in overcoming their physical differences and who work instead to influence the world in a positive way. Lizzie became a best-selling author and motivational speaker, starring in her own documentary in 2015. JR acted in All My Children, won Dancing with the Stars in 2011, and penned a best-selling memoir.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; While not quite as high-profile, Dawn&amp;#39;s successes include becoming an award-winning video editor, earning international certification as an Icelandic horse trainer, hosting an online webinar series addressing appearance-related issues called Friending the Mirror, and sharing her universal message of resilience and embracing differences with groups of varying ages as a professional motivational speaker. Dawn has also been in a happy marriage for twenty years and counting.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Yes, there will be challenges and emotional pain to endure. However, there can also be triumph, joy and love. This book will help you:&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;ul&gt; 	&lt;li&gt;Evaluate your own feelings about your change.&lt;/li&gt; 	&lt;li&gt;Understand the reactions of others.&lt;/li&gt; 	&lt;li&gt;Avoid social isolation.&lt;/li&gt; 	&lt;li&gt;Gain confidence that romance is possible.&lt;/li&gt; 	&lt;li&gt;Take control of your life so you can move forward.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Facial Shift is about integrating your life before and after, and is a helpful guide to navigating the world with a facial difference. You can count on it as a source of hope, validation and reassurance, as well as a link to a vibrant community of people who can share experiences and tips for dealing with the common challenges associated with surviving, and thriving in the world with a changed countenance.&lt;/p&gt;" />
