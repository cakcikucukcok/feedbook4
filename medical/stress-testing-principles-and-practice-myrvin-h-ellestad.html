  <title>Stress Testing: Principles and Practice - Myrvin H. Ellestad</title>
      <meta name="description" content="From reviews of previous editions:  This remains...the best book to buy on the subject of exercise testing...an excellent book aimed at general physicians and cardiologists...recommended with enthusiasm.--International Journal of Cardiology  This book is to be recommended to all physicians who use exercise testing as a diagnostic or rehabilitation procedure...--Cardiology in Practice  This is an excellent and detailed text describing the principles and practice of stress testing...I highly recommend this book for anyone involved in non-invasive cardiology.--The Journal of Cardiovascular and Pulmonary Technology  The authors style is to be lauded...(He) states clearly the absolute, relative, and contraindications to stress testing...highly recommended.--Arch Phys Med Rehabil  I highly recommend this text as a well-written, integrated collection on current research, pathophysiology, and clinical applications.--Physical Therapy  Although the general format of Stress Testing has not been changed in the Fifth Edition, the chapters have been thoroughly revised and updated.  Take Home messages are sprinkled throughout the book to emphasize major concepts. The chapter on electrocardiographic changes has been completely re-organized to highlight the importance of unconventional markers of ischemia.  Two new chapters cover the role of exercise echocardiography and exercise testing in congestive heart failure.  Overall, Stress Testing, Fifth Edition, remains an essential resource for cardiologists and exercise physiologists." />
