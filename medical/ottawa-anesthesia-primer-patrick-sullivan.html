  <title>Ottawa Anesthesia Primer - Patrick Sullivan</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The Ottawa Anesthesia Primer is an essential primary text for medical students and residents completing a rotation in anesthesia. Written by over 40 authors and edited by Dr. Patrick Sullivan, the Ottawa Anesthesia Primer updates their previous popular text entitled Anesthesia for Medical Students. General and specific learning objectives have been carefully identified and can be tailored to the students unique needs during their rotation. In addition, each chapter begins with learning objectives and key points for the student. Throughout the text, emphasis has been given to knowledge, procedures and skills with a focus on preoperative assessment, securing intravenous access, airway management, basic resuscitation skills, acute pain management and the safe use of local anesthetics. Additionally, within the Primer’s 26 chapters, anesthesiologists, anesthesia residents and physicians from other specialties will find valuable discussions on advanced topics including management of the difficult airway, regional anesthesia, acute pain, chronic pain, obstetrical anesthesia, management of the circulation and adult and neonatal resuscitation to name just a few. The revised text was renamed the Ottawa Anesthesia Primer recognizing that the content is suitable for medical care providers practicing in a wide variety of roles. Accompanying videos and hyperlinks to reference articles provide clinicians with immediate access up-to-date landmark articles. The reader has the option of viewing the Primer in a print or electronic format. The electronic ePrimer is available as an iBook that can be purchased for use on an iPad by downloading a free Apple application called iBooks. It is also available as an ePub version and a DRM pdf for viewing on other electronic readers. The ePrimer offers URL links, video links, and expanded case problem discussions. Selected URL addresses for additional resources are listed in the printed version of the Primer." />
