  <title>Psychiatry Board Review - Dr. Rajesh Tampi, Dr. Kristina Zdanys, Dr. Mark Oldham</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The field of psychiatry is evolving rapidly specifically in the areas of classification of many psychiatric disorders, psychopharmacology and psychotherapeutics. The new Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders: DSM-5 which was introduced in 2013 forms the basis of the new classification system in psychiatry. The American Board of Psychiatry and Neurology is also in the process of phasing in DSM-5 criteria to the board examination, such that by 2017 the examination material will exclusively reflect the new manual. As psychiatric trainees and psychiatrists prepare for their certification and recertification examinations using the new classification system, a new board review textbook is imperative to address these changes in order to prepare them for the certification examinations as well as for their clinical practice. To help with this process we have compiled a list of 1000 questions and answers in psychiatry and neurology using the most current information available in the field and using the DSM 5 classification system. This book has been specifically written for the busy professional who does not have the time to access numerous resources necessary to prepare for professional examinations." />
