  <title>The Adhd Fraud - Fred A. Baughman Jr., Craig Hovey</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Fred A. Baughman Jr., MD is an adult and child neurologist who has made &quot;disease&quot; (brain tumor, multiple sclerosis, etc.) vs. &quot;no disease&quot; (emotional, psychiatric) diagnoses daily and has discovered and described real diseases.  Herein he describes the difference between psychiatry/psychology, on the one hand, and neurology and all organic medicine, on the other, and why ADHD and all of psychiatry&#39;s &quot;chemical imbalances&quot; are not diseases at all--but fraud. Referring to psychiatry, he states: &quot;They made a list of the most common symptoms of emotional discomfiture of children and in a stroke that could not be more devoid of science or Hippocratic motive-termed them &quot; diseases&quot;/ &quot;chemical imbalances&quot; each needing/requiring a &quot;chemical balancer&quot;- a pill.&quot;  In 1970, when &quot;hyperactivity&quot;/&quot;minimal brain damage&quot; (forerunners of ADHD) was first represented to Congress to be a brain disease, only 150,000 had it.  Today, not by science or truth, but the &quot;big lie&quot; -saying it is a disease often enough, 6 million have it!  Nor is ADHD the only &quot;chemical imbalance.&quot; They give us conduct disorder (CD), oppositional-defiant disorder (ODD), major depressive disorder (MDD), OCD, PTSD, GAD, SAD, etc., a total of 374 psychiatric disorders in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM-IV-TR) of the American Psychiatric Association (APA), said to be &quot;chemical imbalances&quot; needing &quot;chemical balancers&quot; --pills!  In 2003 Congressional hearings it was said that 17% of the nation&#39;s school children, 8.8 million, were labeled and drugged by psychiatry. Today it is 20%; one in five; over 10 million!  How better to sew the seeds of our own destruction?  As if this were not enough, the President&#39;s New Freedom Commission on Mental Health is set to foist compulsory, government-mandated, mental health screening on all 52 million US schoolchildren.  When normal people are lied to, told they have a &quot;disease&quot; to make &quot;patients&quot; of them, their right to informed consent has been abrogated and they no longer live in a democracy.  When, pursuant to that lie, they are drugged, what we have is not &quot;treatment&quot; but poisoning.  This is the greatest health care fraud in modern medical history." />
