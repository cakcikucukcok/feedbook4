  <title>Practice Accounts Made Easy - Ann Tudor</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Most general practices are businesses of quite significant
size and yet many GPs are not clear on what the detail of their practice
accounts really means. This book will help if you have ever found yourself
confused by:
&lt;p&gt;* a balance sheet&lt;br&gt;
* capital accounts&lt;br&gt;
* profit-sharing ratios&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It will also help you to understand how practices are paid:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;* &lt;b&gt;the differences
between payments under the GMS, PMS, APMS and MCP contracts&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;br&gt;
* the
effects of transitioning from PMS to GMS contracts&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;
* the mechanisms for claims and payments&lt;br&gt;
* property and other reimbursements, &lt;b&gt;including the Premises Costs Directions&lt;br&gt;
* the new
GP Induction and Refresher Scheme&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, as an individual GP it will tell you about:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;* how you pay your tax and how it might appear in
the practice accounts&lt;br&gt;
* tax deductible expenses&lt;br&gt;
* the differences between being employed and
self-employed for tax purposes&lt;br&gt;
* joining and leaving a practice&lt;br&gt;
* buying a share in the surgery premises&lt;br&gt;
* forming a limited company for tax purposes&lt;br&gt;
* &lt;b&gt;the NHS
Pension Scheme and its various ‘sections’&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;
* superannuation
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a book for all those confused by accounting
terminology, from GP registrars to GP principals.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Reviews of the
previous edition&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;“Great book for GP&#39;s who want to get a better understanding of the
financial aspects of general practice. It explains clearly the payment
structure of general practices and also gives good information about practice
accounts. Highly recommended ...”&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;“Great book, up to date, accurate, really clarifies the minefield of GP
accounting. Explains clearly and succinctly how the practice accounts are made
up and what happens when joining and retiring from practice.” &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;“This book is bang up to date and incredibly easy to follow. Contains
useful and up to the minute information, and serves as a great source for
reference.”&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />
