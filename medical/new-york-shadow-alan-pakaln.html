  <title>New York Shadow - Alan Pakaln</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Each of these chapters has a story, and each is an expression of my life at the time the pictures were taken. Taking a picture was always a &amp;nbsp;natural thing for me to do; I didn&amp;#39;t think about showing them to anyone besides friends and family. I never set out to be a photographer.&lt;br /&gt;
It seems simultaneously odd and perfectly natural that now, as I&amp;#39;m older, I want to show them. Odd, because showing is not the reason I took them in the first place, and natural, because I like them enough to want to share. I guess it&amp;#39;s a natural evolution of creating over time.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
The five series in &amp;quot;New York Shadow&amp;quot; are images that have had a direct and personal impact on me. They represent some hard-to-see events, perhaps places, and in times, one may not have had the opportunity to visit. A little off the beaten path: Coney Island, 1965; Night From A Car Window, 1965; Little Italy, The Feast of San Gennaro, 1971; Bellevue Hospital, 1982; Times Square From a Bus, 2000.&lt;br /&gt;
All photographs are presented full-frame, that is, without cropping, and also without alterations other than brightness and contrast adjustments for printing.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;" />
