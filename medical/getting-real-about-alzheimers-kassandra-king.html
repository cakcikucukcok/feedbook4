  <title>Getting Real about Alzheimers - Kassandra King</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Getting REAL About Alzheimer&amp;#39;s&lt;/em&gt; proposes a shift away from the negative beliefs that contribute to a downward spiral of dementia. A shift is possible, and you can see when it happens. The difference is huge! &amp;quot;Getting &lt;em&gt;REAL&lt;/em&gt;&amp;quot; is a reference to &lt;em&gt;Rementia through Engagement, Assistance, and Love&lt;/em&gt;. As a guide for family and friends of persons with Alzheimer&amp;#39;s as well as for professional caregivers, these pages contain practical solutions in eldercare anyone can apply everyday.&lt;br /&gt;
Eighteen months after the start of the garden project, a care resident previously consumed by his loss of personhood is found watering and working in the beautiful garden he created. His story of transformation starts this book. From there, &lt;em&gt;Getting REAL About Alzheimer&amp;#39;s&lt;/em&gt; explains the shift to rementia and the glory of caregiving from the heart.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;------------&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;I am literally blown away. This book has a wonderful, gentle but clear explanatory tone of sound and experienced reasoning. Empathy, in the truest sense, is glowing from the pages. It is very lucid. It is very well written. I might also have an elevated understanding of the issues, since I worked many years in Swedish hospitals and with the elderly population. I always had a great connection with them. I am reminded of many similar, great and insightful experiences, while I am reading. The anecdotes have brought tears of joy to my eyes. Something big and altruistic is documented with this book.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Peter Nilsson&lt;/strong&gt;, Caregiver&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;-----------&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With a degree from the University of North Texas and post graduate certification in long-term care from Texas State University in 1996, Kassandra King worked as a licensed administrator at large facilities in Texas and California and served as Public Policy Director and Professional Education Manager at two chapters of the Alzheimer&amp;#39;s Association. Her inspiration to write this book came from working as Program Manager of Engagement at one of the largest memory care communities in California. She now owns Alzheimer&amp;#39;s Connection La Mesa, where she is happily occupied as a care consultant, care manager and rementia care educator.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;" />
