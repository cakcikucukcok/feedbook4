  <title>Crossing Borders - Jenny Wickford, Fatumo Osman</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Authors Jenny Wickford and Fatumo Osman come from very different backgrounds, having both grown up outside of Sweden, but each moving there when they were nineteen. Jenny grew up in Pakistan, then moved to Sweden, the home of her parents. Fatumo came to Sweden after fleeing from the civil war in Somalia. They formed an instant bond, sharing stories and thoughts about the changes they experienced, realising that, as people, there are more similarities than differences between us.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The increasing possibilities of travel, whether by force or by choice, have brought people together like never before. However, it has also triggered the building of walls and the hardening of borders. &lt;em&gt;Crossing Borders&lt;/em&gt; explores what it means to live together in intercultural environments, and offers practical solutions for living and learning together at a time when this subject is more important than ever.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With its heartfelt blend of the personal and academic voice, the book provides a refreshing viewpoint in an informed but accessible way. Both authors hold PhD degrees and have done extensive research, but have also spent years in practical application of their metiers. Fatumo is a nurse and Jenny a physiotherapist. Both are actively involved in the support of women&amp;rsquo;s health and education&lt;em&gt;. &amp;nbsp;Crossing&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Borders&lt;/em&gt; is a timely and inspiring work for Spring 2018.&lt;/p&gt;" />
