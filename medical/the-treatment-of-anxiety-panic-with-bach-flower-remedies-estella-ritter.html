  <title>The Treatment of Anxiety &amp; Panic with Bach Flower Remedies - Estella Ritter</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Anxiety being the main mental health concern for women, and second only to substance abuse in men, The Treatment of Anxiety &amp; Panic with Bach Flower Remedies offers both a practical and comprehensive guide to everyone struggling with panic attacks, anxiety attacks, social fears, generalized anxiety, or obsessive compulsive behaviors.   Representing a fluid, self-directed process to emotional healing the goal of the technique is to present a very contemporary, user-friendly, and immediate response to emotional distress.   Working by specifically targeting every type of negative state of mind reveals an amazing, subtle energy approach that is neither created in the language of pop culture, nor new age therapy.   By explaining step-by-step how to use one of the most effective healing tools nature has provided to us, this book in a non-clinical voice, addresses the debilitating impact of anxiety, and shows how to effectively overcome anxiety driven symptoms in order to achieve a lasting recovery.  Rather than just covering up and continuing to suppress emotional difficulties with drugs, this book supplies the tools needed to manage anxiety, and after that to resolve emotional problems
 The information can be used to develop ones own self-help program, or, as an adjunct to other healing modalities, the technique will reliably deliver clarity and a lifetime of emotional assistance." />
