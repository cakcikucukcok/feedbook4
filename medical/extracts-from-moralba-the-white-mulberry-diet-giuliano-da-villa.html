  <title>Extracts From: Moralba The White Mulberry Diet - Giuliano Da Villa</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;i&gt;White Mulberry diet &amp;ndash; How to Lose Weight and Age in Good Health&lt;/i&gt;, written by the famous endocrinologist and dietary researcher Professor Giuliano Da Villa, has been available since September in many book stores around the world.&lt;br /&gt;
The book contains advice on how to lose weight or improve one&amp;rsquo;s health by following a specific diet based on vegetables, fruit and proteins, and by limiting the amount of foods containing fattening carbohydrates (i.e. pasta, rice, potatoes, desserts, ice cream etc.).&lt;br /&gt;
What is innovative about this diet is that it makes it possible to eat foods containing such fattening carbohydrates with the aid of a natural extract of White Mulberry, which prevents the intestine from absorbing sugar.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
The guidelines for the White Mulberry diet are based on this principle and are divided into 4 easy-to-follow dietary steps - 1st, 2nd, 3rd and 4th phase - which have been successfully tested on obese people." />
