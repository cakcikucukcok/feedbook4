Author Advocates Healthy Lifestyle and Disease Prevention to start from the&lt;br&gt; Womb and dieting to begin in the Crib&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
New Health Book, written in easy-to-understand laymans term, provides thought-provoking and valuable health reference designed to change lives of individuals and society as a whole through good pre-emptive and proactive social initiatives and more responsible parenting for healthy lifestyle and disease prevention, which the cardiac surgeon author says must start in the womb and safe dieting should begin in the crib, to maximize their full potential in achieving their goals.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;XLIBRIS - (PRWEB) August 29, 2011&lt;br&gt;
What is the best strategy to prevent diseases?&lt;/b&gt; Cardiac Surgeon Emeritus in Northwest Indiana Dr. Philip S. Chua attempts to provide resolution to this issue as he presents &lt;b&gt;Lets Stop Killing Our Children&lt;/b&gt;, a valuable, inspiring, and innovative 794-page health guide that focuses on disease prevention starting from ground zero, and highlights the fundamental obligation parents and society have in teaching children how to life a healthy lifestyle by setting good examples early on. 
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
This revolutionary concept puts the onus squarely on society, parents and guardians of young children, who are totally at the mercy of society and of these adults, whose good or bad examples, habits and behaviors will inevitably be emulated by the children. It is in the first five formative years of the children and up to age 12 when instilling proper discipline and behavioral modification are most effective, states this heart surgeon.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Almost all diseases known to man are self-induced and are, therefore, preventableMost of us seemed to have unwittingly programmed our mindset and behavior to a self-destruct and slow-suicide modethis negative surrender and fatalistic attitude are what this book aims to change, Dr. Chua critically pointed out in his book.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
An international health advocate and writer, Dr. Philip S. Chua, in this book of information, philosophy and principles, poses this great challenge to society as a whole in his belief that most diseases known to man are self-induced through self-abuse. It is important that both society as a whole and parents play their essential role of doing what is right for the children, way before age 5  to save these young lives from avoidable morbidity and premature death as they grow to middle age and beyond. After all, says Dr. Chua, the race does not start in the middle.       
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
The author points out that autopsy findings on children, as young as 4-5 who were victims of accidents, already had evidence of arteriosclerosis (hardening of their arteries) which we see in adultswe must be doing something wrong.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&quot;Are we losing the war on diseases because we are starting late and lagging far behind in this race?&quot; ponders the cardiac surgeon.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Dr. Chua, in his book, strongly suggests for parents and society as a whole to practice this novel pre-emptive and proactive health concept even before conception to achieve a healthier family, a healthier citizenry, and thus a healthier nation. 
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&quot;Since, we have not really significantly succeeded in our war against many diseases over the past half a century, the medical community and society as a whole need to seriously re-evaluate of our current conventional strategy in dealing with health and disease prevention, if we are to contain, if not eradicate, the common diseases afflicting man around the world today, including hypertension, obesity, diabetes, heart disease, stroke, and even cancer,&quot; admonishes the author.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
This pre-emptive health strategy could forever change the role of parents and society in our quest for health, well-being, happiness, and longevity.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
This challenging and stimulating coffee-table book of wisdom is a must-read. Every home deserves one.
