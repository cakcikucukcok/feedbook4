  <title>Caring for Autism - Michael A. Ellis Do</title>
      <meta name="description" content="When a professional states, &quot;Your child has Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD)&quot;, it is enough to make your whole world fall apart. What does it mean to be on the autism spectrum? How will this affect your child&#39;s life, your life, the life of your family, and others you interact with? What sorts of medications, therapies, and alternative methods are used to help manage the disorder? What are the financial and legal ramifications? How will this affect schooling, your spiritual growth, and everyday life?  These are just a few of the questions that will rapidly cross your mind.
&lt;em&gt;Caring for Autism: Practical Advice from a Parent and Physician&lt;/em&gt; delves into all these questions and more. As the father of a daughter with ASD and as a trained psychiatrist who specializes in ASD, Dr. Michael A. Ellis provides a holistic view of what comes after diagnosis. In user-friendly tones, he answers the most commonly asked questions about what it&#39;s actually like to live with ASD, what medications and therapies are available, and the global impact it has on the child&#39;s environment. With the help of his wife, Lori Layton Ellis, to provide a mother&#39;s perspective, Dr. Ellis shares personal stories of their 10-year journey in order to provide insight and support for anyone - patient, parent, caregiver - traversing the difficulties of autism." />
