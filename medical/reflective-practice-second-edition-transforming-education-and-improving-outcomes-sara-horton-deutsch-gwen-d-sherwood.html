  <title>Reflective Practice, Second Edition: Transforming Education and Improving Outcomes - Sara Horton-Deutsch, Gwen D. Sherwood</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Nursing can be a physically and intellectually demanding profession, and most nursing programs focus on instilling the techniques and knowledge necessary to prepare novice nurses. Rarely addressed in nurse education, though, are the human and emotional factors that impact nurses at all levels from day one. The fact is, the emotional labor of nursing takes a demanding toll as nurses cope with patients, compassion fatigue, and increasingly complex workplace and interpersonal issues that deplete energy and motivation.
Reflective Practice, Second Edition: Transforming Education and Improving Outcomes offers educators and learners a path to incorporate Caring Science, emotional intelligence, and social justice into nursing education and practice. Authors Sara Horton-Deutsch and Gwen Sherwood provide a rich resource for academic and clinical nurse educators, students, and practicing nurses interested in developing leadership capacity or advancing professional development. 
Reflective Practice pulls together multiple approaches to reflective instruction for self-improvement through exercises that are adaptable to both personal life and professional work. This book also incorporates complementary perspectives that focus on quality and safety while emphasizing lifelong learning and the emotional significance of being in community with others." />
