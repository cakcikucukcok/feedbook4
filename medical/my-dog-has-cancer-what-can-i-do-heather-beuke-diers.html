  <title>My Dog Has Cancer.  What Can I Do? - Heather Beuke Diers</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;While documenting Nolas journey with cancer and holistic medicine, I gathered information that can now guide you through every stage of your dogs cancer. After completing hundreds of hours of research and taking a great team of veterinarians advice, I have created an economical, cancer-fighting and immune-building protocol, for any canine (or human!) fighting cancer.  I explain how cancer works in the body and how to create a cancer-killing environment with, wait for itFOOD!
How you treat the body will affect the outcome
this thought should empower you!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although we were able to turn a three-months-to-live diagnosis into a year of great quality of life for our girl, I believe we could have prolonged her life even longer if we had started with the protocol with which we ended  shared in &lt;i&gt;My Dog Has Cancer. What Can I Do?&lt;/i&gt; Nola had a fast-spreading, incurable cancer, osteosarcoma, which would not wait for me to catch up on my research. My mission is to save you time, so you can start fighting cancer immediately. The intent is not to persuade you to do exactly as we did; I also share our mistakes and changes I would consider, if faced with the same circumstances again.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;This protocol should not replace the care of your veterinarian and other necessary medical providers. Always inform them of all food and supplements in your protocol, before giving them to your pet. I am not a veterinarian, but I worked closely with my veterinarian, who practices both Western and holistic medicine, while building our protocol to treat Nolas cancer.&lt;/p&gt;" />
