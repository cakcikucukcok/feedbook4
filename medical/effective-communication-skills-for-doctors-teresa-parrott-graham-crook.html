  <title>Effective Communication Skills for Doctors - Teresa Parrott, Graham Crook</title>
      <meta name="description" content="There is an urgent need to improve doctors’ communication skills. Research has shown that poor communication can contribute to patient dissatisfaction, lack of compliance and increased medico-legal problems. Improved communication skills will impact positively on all of these areas. The last fifteen years have seen unprecedented changes in medicine and the role of doctors. Effective communication skills are vital to these new roles. But communication is not just related to personality. Skills can be learned which can make your communication more effective, and help you to improve your relationships with patients, their families and fellow doctors. This book shows you how to learn those skills and outlines why we all need to communicate more effectively. Healthcare is increasingly becoming a partnership. Change is happening at all levels, from government directives to patient expectations. Communication is a bridge between the wisdom of the past and the vision of the future. Readers can also access a free online module; once completed, they can download a certificate for their portfolio of learning/Revalidation/CPD records. This easy-to-read guide will help medical students and doctors at all stages of their careers improve their communication within a hospital environment." />
