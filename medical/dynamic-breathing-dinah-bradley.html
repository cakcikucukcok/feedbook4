  <title>Dynamic Breathing - Dinah Bradley</title>
      <meta name="description" content="George Bernard Shaw was correct to say that awareness of breathing already indicates problems. The sensation of dyspnoea (difficulty in breathing) varies from person to person, but is the defining mark of asthma. According to the WHO, asthma affects some 150 million people globally; it even affects animals. People with asthma often develop appalling breathing habits which worsen or precipitate attacks. Since the advent of inhalers and modern drugs over the last 30 years, doctors have paid less attention to the business of breathing itself. Yet, correct breathing helps people reduce their medication and their stress levels, and enables them to exercise more effectively and enjoy life with more confidence. This book, written by two physiotherapists, gives a thorough view of what happens in the chest and in the brain during breathing, and gives detailed and illustrated suggestions on how to breathe for maximum comfort for asthma and other disorders." />
