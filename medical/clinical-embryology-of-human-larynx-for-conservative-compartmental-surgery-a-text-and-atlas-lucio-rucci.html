  <title>Clinical Embryology of Human Larynx for Conservative Compartmental Surgery. A Text and Atlas - Lucio Rucci</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The volume shows the morphogenesis and differentiation of the human larynx during the fetal period. This knowledge is relevant to understand laryngeal functions as well as the diffusion of cancer and the therapy of low stage cancer. Through embryological analysis, the anatomical basis of laryngeal functions may be best recognized and consequent indications may be given to perform conservative compartmental surgery. Each chapter of the volume describes a developmental step and compares the findings with the adult condition. Introductory remarks and comments to each chapter are completed by captions to individual figures, so that the text and images are offered to the reader as a single unit. He has authored several full papers, including papers on journals with impact factor, and presentations at scientific meetings. 
Lucio Rucci, MD and specialist in Otorhinolaryngology, Audiology and Dentistry; is associate professor of Otorhinolaryngology and co-ordinates the PhD course in surgical oncology of the head and neck, at the University of Florence.
His main research and clinical interests are the surgical therapy of laryngeal cancer, the clinical embryology of the larynx and the microscopical and endoscopical surgery of the nose and paranasal sinuses.
He has authored several full papers, including papers on journals with impact factor, and presentations at scientific meetings." />
