  <title>Statistical Models in Epidemiology - David Clayton, Michael Hills</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This self-contained account of the statistical basis of epidemiology has been written specifically for those with a basic training in biology, therefore no previous knowledge is assumed and the mathematics is deliberately kept at a manageable level.  The authors show how all statistical analysis of data is based on probability models, and once one understands the model, analysis follows easily. In showing how to use models in epidemiology the authors have chosen to emphasize the role of likelihood, an approach to statistics which is both simple and intuitively satisfying.  More complex problems can then be tackled by natural extensions of the simple methods.  Based on a highly successful course, this book explains the essential statistics for all epidemiologists." />
