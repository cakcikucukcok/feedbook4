  <title>Sleep, Health, and Society - Francesco P. Cappuccio, Michelle A. Miller, Steven W. Lockley, Shantha M. W. Rajaratnam</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Sleep disturbances and sleep deprivation are increasingly common in modern society. Epidemiological methods of investigation have shown that sleep deprivation is associated with a variety of chronic conditions and health outcomes. Sleep medicine is a rapidly growing field of clinical research, affecting people across their lifespan.
Relevant to a wide range of specialities including respiratory medicine, neurology, cardiology, and psychiatry, sleep also has a significant impact on the study of epidemiology, public health, and preventive medicine. Sleep, Health, and Society presents epidemiological evidence linking sleep deprivation and disruption to several chronic conditions, and explores the public health implications with the view to developing preventive strategies.
The new edition of Sleep, Health, and Society provides up-to-date information on recently discovered areas of sleep medicine. Fully updated to reflect new research and data, as well as additional new chapters exploring eating patterns, nutrition, pregnancy, cancer, pain, and CBT in relation to sleep.
Written by leading experts in the field of sleep medicine, Sleep, Health, and Society is ideal for students and professionals in epidemiology and public health. The research presented would also be valuable to respiratory physicians, neurologists, cardiologists, and psychiatrists who are interested in the impact of sleep disturbances and disorders." />
