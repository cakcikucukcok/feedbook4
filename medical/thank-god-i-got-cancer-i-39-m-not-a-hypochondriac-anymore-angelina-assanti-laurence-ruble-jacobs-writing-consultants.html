  <title>Thank God I Got Cancer...I&#39;m Not a Hypochondriac Anymore! - Angelina Assanti, Laurence Ruble, Jacobs Writing Consultants</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Angelina Assanti is best known for writing award-winning fiction novels. In the spring of 2015, she was advised to pen a non-fiction book to encourage expansion of her reading audience. After a couple of months, a horrible thing led her to have a topic - she was diagnosed with cancer! When she went to the bookstore at the treatment center where she was going and inquired about a funny book, the sales clerk scoffed at her and said no one would want to read a funny cancer book. So Angelina decided to write one. This book has been an overwhelming success and encouragement to those who have been through cancer or are entering through the process. This guide not only helps the patient but also advises friends and families on what to say, and what not to say to the patient. It explains feelings and frustrations that are difficult to talk about. Not every patient want to talk about what they&amp;#39;re going through with their doctors, never mind family and friends that have not been through it and can&amp;#39;t understand how difficult the journey is. There are many&amp;nbsp;terrible things&amp;nbsp;patients experience through cancer. One of the most surprising for the author was when people whom had never had cancer told her what she should do. Although the book is a quick-read, it&amp;#39;s chock full of solid advice and laugh-out-loud moments. The book was given a five-star review from Readers&amp;#39; Favorites...&amp;quot;Assanti&amp;#39;s prose is beautiful and she knows how to connect with readers through her masterful use of humor.&amp;quot; The book has also won two President&amp;#39;s Awards from the Florida Authors and Publisher&amp;#39;s Association and is a 2016 Finalist in the international contest by Readers&amp;#39; Favorites.&lt;/p&gt;" />
