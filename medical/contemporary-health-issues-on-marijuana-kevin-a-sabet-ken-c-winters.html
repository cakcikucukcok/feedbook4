  <title>Contemporary Health Issues on Marijuana - Kevin A. Sabet, Ken C. Winters</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Marijuana is the most commonly used illicit drug in the United States. A growing number of Americans now perceive marijuana as relatively harmless and the notion that the drug should be legalized it is becoming increasingly popular.  As policy in this area remains dynamic, resulting health issues, including the harm to adolescents and the potential for compounds to have therapeutic value, become more salient.
&lt;em&gt;Contemporary Health Issues on Marijuana&lt;/em&gt; is a balanced, empirically driven volume that highlights new and meaningful theory and evidence pertaining to marijuana use. Authored by a multidisciplinary group of experts from the fields of psychology, epidemiology, medicine, and criminal justice, chapters comprehensively review numerous research domains of public health interest with respect to marijuana use, including the drug&#39;s impact on cognitive and neurological functioning, its medical effects, treatment approaches for cannabis use disorders, the effects of marijuana smoking on lung function, and marijuana-impaired driving. The book concludes with a chapter on policy implications, taking stock of current trends and anticipating prevalence rates and resulting health consequences that will only continue to grow. &lt;em&gt;Contemporary Health Issues on Marijuana&lt;/em&gt; is a resource of great clinical, scientific, and public policy value that will be a must-have for researchers, practitioners, and policymakers alike." />
