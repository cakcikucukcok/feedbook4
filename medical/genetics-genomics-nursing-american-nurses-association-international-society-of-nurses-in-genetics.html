  <title>Genetics/Genomics Nursing - American Nurses Association, International Society of Nurses in Genetics</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Completely updated by genetics/genomics nurses for genetics/genomics nurses. The first best resource for the RN or APRN genetics/genomics nurse at any level and in any setting. Essential for all involved in this nursing practice specialty now and throughout this decade.
Genetics/genomics nursing practice and care focuses on the actual and potential impact of genetic and genomic influences on health. These nurses advise and educate clients and families on such influences that might impact their health, identify and manage physiologic responses. The goals of their nursing interventions: to optimize health, reduce health risks, treat disease, and promote wellness. Their research and evidence-based practice also includes interprofessional collegiality and collaboration with other genetics/genomics professionals and other healthcare professionals to provide quality patient care.
A workgroup of genetics/genomics nurse experts, convened by ISONG and ANA, completely updated and expanded the previous edition. With input from nurses nationwide, their revision addressed and incorporated ongoing and anticipated changes in genetics/genomics nursing as well as in nursing and health care in general.
The revised scope of genetics/genomics nursing practice—the who, what, where, when, why, and how of practice—sets the context for understanding and using the standards: the underlying assumptions, characteristics, environments and settings, education and training requirements, key issues and trends, and ethical and conceptual bases of genetics/genomics nursing.
The updated 16 standards frame any evaluation of the outcomes and goals of, and measure the accountabilities for, general, graduate-level prepared, and advanced practice genetics/genomics nurses. By meeting each standard&#39;s competencies, these nurses can demonstrate compliance with that standard.
A foundational volume primarily for those directly involved with genetics/genomics nursing practice, education, and research, other nurses and allied healthcare providers, researchers, and scholars will find value in its content.
About ANA&#39;s Specialty Nursing Standards
Since the late 1990s, ANA has partnered with other nursing organizations to establish a formal process for recognition of specialty areas of nursing practice. This includes the criteria for approving the specialty itself and the scope statement, and an acknowledgment by ANA of the standards of practice for that specialty. Because of the significant changes in the evolving nursing and healthcare environments, ANA&#39;s approval of specialty nursing scope statements and its acknowledgment of specialty standards of practice remain valid for five years, starting from the publication date of the documents.
The standards in this publication are based on language from ANA&#39;s Nursing: Scope and Standards of Practice, Second Edition, a helpful supplement to this specialty text, which in turn is of optimal use with two complementary ANA texts: Nursing&#39;s Social Policy Statement and Guide to the Code of Ethics for Nurses. Together, these three books help guide nursing practice, thinking, and decision-making. The set is proving useful as a professional reference, classroom textbook, in-service training guide, and credentialing exam resource." />
