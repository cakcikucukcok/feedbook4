  <title>Susan: the Story of a Miracle - George W. White</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;On January 26, 2012, the lives of George and Susan White were suddenly turned upside when Susan awoke with horrifying stomach pain. After being rushed to the emergency room, Susan learned that gallstones had become trapped in her bile duct. In a matter of hours, Georges wife had transformed from a perfectly healthy woman to a hospital patient struggling to survive. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this memoir, George shares details from the roller-coaster journey he and his wife began that January morning. Susan contracted pancreatitis and began to suffer from serious complications that kept her in various hospitals for months to come. As George documents an experience that was both stressful and rewarding, he offers a glimpse into both the difficult times they faced during Susans illness and the comforting moments fueled by love and generosity from friends and family. As Susan slowly began to recover, George chronicles how both he and his wife changed their outlooks on life and became more grateful for everything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Susan: The Story of a Miracle&lt;/i&gt; is an inspirational personal story of hope, faith, family, and friends as a husband and wife bravely face a health scare together and discover that miracles really do happen.&lt;/p&gt;" />
