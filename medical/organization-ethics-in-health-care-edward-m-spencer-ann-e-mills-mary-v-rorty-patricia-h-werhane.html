  <title>Organization Ethics in Health Care - Edward M. Spencer, Ann E. Mills, Mary V. Rorty, Patricia H. Werhane</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The ethical aspects of the operation of healthcare organizations (HCOs) are central to the delivery of health care.  Organization Ethics in Health Care begins by assessing the shortcomings of clinical ethics, business ethics, and professional ethics as a basis for solving problems that have emerged in healthcare delivery systems since the advent of managed care. The text focuses on the meaning of the developent of the HCO in our society and what its present status is. The authors point out that moral parameters endorsed by society have guided previous shifts in the relationships among important HCO stakeholders, but that these parameters have been unclear or missing altogether during the past tumultous decade. Finally, they describe the key elements for the successful implementation of a fully functioning healthcare organization ethics program and what it can mean to the institution, its associated clinicians and employees, its patients, and its community.  Moving from theory to practical application, this book will serve as an excellent student text, a professional guide, and a reference work." />
