  <title>Nannie&#39;s Herbal Quickfix - Yvonne Glover</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Hello!  I would like to introduce myself. I am Nannie of course this name has been assigned to my Grandchildren from  real name, Yvonne Glover.
about 37 years ago I became interested in natural herbal remedies, when my own grandmother gave me heated homemade red wine for cramps, and they went away. I first thought it was just a need so my mind and body accepted it after more remedies worked, and many of those worked so fast that after much goading from friends and family, I decided to write this book of FAST working remedies.
It is my belief that the body responds to natural remedies because of the fact that since the body heals itself, it can recognize something natural better than it can chemicals. The chemicals can harm you, so requires a doctors permission via prescription.
My quick fixes will bring fast results such as Acne gone in 24 hours, or Athletes Foot in 12 hours. Perfectly safe and Natural, NO side effects.. Some have asked if this means they should discontinue their doctors medication. 
 I always tell them NO, and they wont have to because their doctors will, once they see the improvements. I also advise them to be sure to check with their doctor, before starting. Many doctor will say no to this because they have no knowledge of herbs. Others will agree because they have educated themselves with the common sense notion that anything natural is likely to be safe as long as you are not allergic.
In any case always check with your doctor." />
