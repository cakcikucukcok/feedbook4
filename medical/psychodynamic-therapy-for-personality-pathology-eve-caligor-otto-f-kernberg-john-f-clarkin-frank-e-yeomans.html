Descriptions of specific psychodynamic techniques that can be exported to shorter-term treatments and acute clinical settings &lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Patient assessment and basic psychodynamic techniques are described in up-to-date, jargon-free terms and richly supported by numerous clinical vignettes, as well as online videos demonstrating interventions. At the end of each chapter, readers will find a summary of key clinical concepts, making this book both a quick reference tool as well as a springboard for continued learning. &lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Clinicians looking for an innovative, trustworthy guide to understanding and treating personality pathology that combines contemporary theory with clinical practice need look no further than Psychodynamic Therapy for Personality Pathology: Treating Self and Interpersonal Functioning.&lt;/P&gt;" />
