  <title>Psychotherapy Relationships That Work: Evidence-Based Responsiveness - John C. Norcross</title>
      <meta name="description" content="First published in 2002, the landmark Psychotherapy Relationships That Work broke new ground by focusing  renewed and corrective attention on the substantial research behind the crucial (but often overlooked) client-therapist relationship. This thoroughly revised edition brings a decade of additional research to the same task. In addition to updating each chapter, the second edition features  new chapters on the effectiveness of the alliance with children and adolescents, the alliance in couples and family therapy, real-time feedback from clients, patient preferences, culture, and attachment style.    The new editon provides two books in one--one on evidence-based relationship elements and one on evidence-based methods of adapting treatment to the individual patient. Each chapter features a specific therapist behavior that improves treatment outcome, or a transdiagnostic patient characteristic (such as reactance, preferences, culture, stage of change) by which clinicians can effectively tailor psychotherapy. All chapters provide original, comprehensive meta-analyses of the relevant research; clinical examples, and research-supported therapeutic practices by distinguished contributors. The result is a compelling synthesis of the best available research, clinical expertise, and patient characteristics in the tradition of evidence-based practice.   The second edition of Psychotherapy Relationships That Work: Evidence-Based Responsiveness  proves indispensible for any mental health professional.  Reviews of the First Edition:  A veritable gold mine of research related to relationships, this is a volume that should be an invaluable reference for every student and practitioner of psychotherapy.--Psychotherapy   This is a MUST READ for any researcher, clinician, or counselor who is genuinely interested in the active ingredients of effective psychotherapy and who appreciates the importance of applying empirical evidence to the therapy relationship.--Arnold A. Lazarus, Ph.D., Distinguished Professor Emeritus, Rutgers University  Psychotherapy Relationships That Work is a superb contemporary textbook and reference source for students and professionals seeking to expand their knowledge and understanding of person-related psychotherapy. --Psychotherapy Research   One is struck with the thoroughness of all the chapters and the care and detail of presentation.--Brief Treatment and Crisis Intervention" />
