  <title>Time Bomb from Within - Dr. Stuart Scheckner</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;This book is a gem. It hits hard at just how simple it is to be poisoned from the vapors from mercury and mercury amalgam exposures and yet just how difficult it is to achieve understanding from anyone in either the health care industry or society in general. Dr. Scheckner is able to take the reader on a journey of just how simple it is for mercury to slowly and silently destroy someones life. People are being hurt, not only from the damaging effects of mercury on ones health, but also from the battle that it takes to achieve acceptance and recognition that mercury poisoning is a disease. This is a compelling story that all too many people in our profession of dentistry and patients who have been treated with mercury amalgam have faced and, because of a societal lack of understanding, will continue to face, unless we start to wake up and stop using this insidious and pernicious agent. &lt;i&gt;Time Bomb from&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;Within: Mercury Poisoning in Dentistry &lt;/i&gt;is a simple but heart-wrenching read for every dental health care professional and anyone who has, or has ever had, a mercury amalgam filling.&lt;/p&gt;
