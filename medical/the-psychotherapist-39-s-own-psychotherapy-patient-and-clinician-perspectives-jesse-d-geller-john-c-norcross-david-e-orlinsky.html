  <title>The Psychotherapist&#39;s Own Psychotherapy: Patient and Clinician Perspectives - Jesse D. Geller, John C. Norcross, David E. Orlinsky</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The Psychotherapist&#39;s Own Psychotherapy: Patient and Clinician Perspectives lifts a curtain that has long shrouded the intimate alliances between therapists and those of their patients who share the same profession. In this unique volume, distinguished contributors explore the multi-faceted nature of the psychotherapy of psychotherapists from &quot;both sides of the couch.&quot; The first-person narratives, clinical wisdom, and research findings gathered together in this book offer guidance about providing effective treatments to therapist patients.
  Part I presents multiple theoretical positions that justify and guide the work of therapists&#39; therapists. In Part II, eminent therapists write eloquently and intimately about their own experiences as patients. Their personal reflections offer valuable insights about what is healing and educational about psychotherapy. These narratives are followed by several chapters reviewing scientific research on therapists in personal therapy, including the first report of relevant findings from a major international survey of psychotherapists.
  In Part III, celebrated therapists from different theoretical orientations offer guidance on conducting therapy with fellow therapists. They reflect on the many challenges, dilemmas, and rewards that arise when two people do the same work. Their chapters offer wisdom and warnings about such issues as power dynamics, boundary maintenance, therapist self-disclosure, the termination process, and the post-termination phase of the relationship. These first-hand accounts are enhanced by research overviews on coducting personal treatment, including a new study of American therapists commissioned for the book. The Psychotherapist&#39;s Own Psychotherapy: Patient and Clinician Perspectives is an essential resource for practitioners and students of all orientations and disciplines." />
