  <title>Cataract Surgery and Phacoemulsification for the Beginning   Surgeons - Dr.Mehdi Vazeen Md, Dr.S.M.Munirul Huq</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Cataract ranks high among the diseases that cause visual disability and blindness in the world. Cataract surgery is the most common surgery performed by an Ophthalmologist. Phacoemulsification is the state of the art in cataract surgery. Learning the technique of phacoemulsification is a major challenge for the trainee and new ophthalmic surgeons. Mastering the technique requires extensive training and a steep learning curve. The authors have discussed the various steps of phacoemulsification and other techniques of cataract surgery like SICS including the difficulties and complications encountered and how to avoid them. A separate chapter deals with the techniques required to get used to an Operating Microscope and the basic principles of the equipments used. 
Phacoemulsification for the beginning surgeons is to guide the trainee and new surgeons to learn the surgery in the shortest possible time in order to gain the necessary expertise to perform the surgery with confidence. 
Both Dr. Munirul Huq and Dr. Mehdi (Matti) Vazeen have extensive experience in cataract surgery and they believe that, the text will help the new surgeon to go through the learning curve and gain proficiency and this will also serve as a reference guide at the time of difficulty and complications. The aim is not to replace other textbooks on the topic but to share the experience of the authors for the benefit of the new upcoming cataract surgeons." />
