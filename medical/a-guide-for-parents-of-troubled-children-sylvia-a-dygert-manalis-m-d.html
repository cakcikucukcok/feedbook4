  <title>A Guide for Parents of Troubled Children: - Sylvia A. Dygert Manalis M. D.</title>
      <meta name="description" content="In this unique book, you will find stories about children with emotional and behavior problems, stories that come to life. For example, meet Ellen in the essay The Whirling Girl. Ellen is a cute girl who cannot sit still or focus well. As Dr. Manalis speaks to Ellen and her parents, it becomes clear to the reader how the diagnosis and plan of treatment evolves. Integrated within Ellens story is information about attention deficit hyperactivity disorder.
In Silence Takes Its Toll, you will meet Ann, who has become depressed for mysterious reasons. You will come along on her journey to discover why she is so unhappy and whether she can be helped.
In The Teen with Mild Autism, you will meet Carl, with whom Dr. Manalis worked for nearly four years. When they first met, Carl sadly stated that no girl would ever love him because of his autism. Over the years, he worked on improving his eye contact and social skills, attended high school, and in the summers, worked for the park department. Carl was seventeen at their final meeting. Showing his improved eye contact and self-confidence, Carl excitedly shares that his friends are looking for a girlfriend for him and that he is confident he is lovable. What a change from their first meeting! Dr. Manalis looks forward to word of Carls wedding in a few years!" />
