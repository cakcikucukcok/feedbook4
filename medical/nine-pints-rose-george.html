  <title>Nine Pints - Rose George</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;An eye-opening exploration of blood, the lifegiving substance with the power of taboo, the value of diamonds and the promise of breakthrough science&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;Blood carries life, yet the sight of it makes people faint. It is a waste product and a commodity pricier than oil. It can save lives and transmit deadly infections. Each one of us has roughly nine pints of it, yet many don&#39;t even know their own blood type. And for all its ubiquitousness, the few tablespoons of blood discharged by 800 million women are still regarded as taboo: menstruation is perhaps the single most demonized biological event.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rose George, author of &lt;i&gt;The Big Necessity&lt;/i&gt;, is renowned for her intrepid work on topics that are invisible but vitally important. In &lt;i&gt;Nine Pints&lt;/i&gt;, she takes us from ancient practices of bloodletting to the breakthough of the &quot;liquid biopsy,&quot; which promises to diagnose cancer and other diseases with a simple blood test. She introduces Janet Vaughan, who set up the world&#39;s first system of mass blood donation during the Blitz, and Arunachalam Muruganantham, known as &quot;Menstrual Man&quot; for his work on sanitary pads for developing countries. She probes the lucrative business of plasma transfusions, in which the US is known as the &quot;OPEC of plasma.&quot; And she looks to the future, as researchers seek to bring synthetic blood to a hospital near you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Spanning science and politics, stories and global epidemics, &lt;i&gt;Nine Pints&lt;/i&gt; reveals our life&#39;s blood in an entirely new light.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Nine Pints &lt;/i&gt;was named one of Bill Gates recommended summer reading titles for 2019. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />
