  <title>Dolores at Fort Hood, Tijuana and Detroit - John Jellinek</title>
      <meta name="description" content="An unsung American heroine, Dolores  a nurse in surgery  is betrayed by her own kind: doctors!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Th e first one, a gynecologist, keeps her waiting for 3 months before he does a D &amp; C, and by way of a biopsy, finds out she has cervical cancer. At first he is going to do a radical hysterectomy, changes his mind, and dumps her on a radiologist with a non-existent Stage IC diagnosis report. The radiologist, not knowing his Merck Manual too well, convinces her that radiology is as effective as a hysterectomy operation for any Stage I cervical cancer.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;
A year later, the cancer had metastasized. She receives chemotherapy and becomes very religious. The tumors disappear and she believes she is healed. However, three months later her health deteriorates, again.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
The husband and Dolores meet a lady cured of lung cancer by a strict metabolic diet and Laetrile pills. This happens while he is on a 3 month tour of duty assignment at Fort Hood, Texas as a civilian engineer for the US Army Tank-Automotive Command. On her advice and a talk with the doctor in Mexico they take a chance to cure Dolores with a trip to Clinica Cydel in Tijuana. After a few days of Laetrile treatment, but inability to hold down food, Dolores collapses and she is hospitalized at Dr. Contreras Hospital del Mar.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
She is put on a plane from San Diego to Detroit 3 weeks later, but rapidly breaks down in health. Her last day out, she attends a faithful Christian service conducted by evangelist Nora Lam. Dolores expires 4 months later." />
