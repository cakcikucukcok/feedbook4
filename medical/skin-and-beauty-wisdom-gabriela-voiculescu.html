  <title>Skin and Beauty Wisdom - Gabriela Voiculescu</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This book is intended as a reference volume only. It is not a medical manual 
and is not a substitute for any treatment that may have been prescribed by your physician. I highly recommend you consult with your doctor before using herbs and essential oils.
Women who are pregnant or considering becoming pregnant should consult their 
doctor before using any herbs, essential oils, or before applying homemade crmes, masks, exfoliators, toners, or cleansers.
Some of the essential oils are strong and must be used with caution.
If you are not sure about the products you want to use, look for them on a reputable website and find out more about the ones you intend using. If homemade remedies for skin care are a new thing in your life, try one at a time and see how it feels. Next time add one more, try different combinations, and the sky will be the limit. You can cook endless formulations and create new treatments. 
Nobody can be like you because you are unique like your fingerprints, so treat yourself in a unique way. Use this collection of old and new beauty wisdom to adapt it to your skin, have fun and enjoy it.  Everything listed in the home remedies chapter I have tried on my family members and myself. We had no bad reactions--only excellent results. I hope you do the same thing. Have a good, young-looking, glowing, healthy skin!" />
