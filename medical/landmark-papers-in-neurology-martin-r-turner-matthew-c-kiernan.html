  <title>Landmark Papers in Neurology - Martin R. Turner, Matthew C. Kiernan</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Current understanding of neurological disease has been evolving over the past 150 years. With the increasing and earlier sub-specialization of neurology trainees, and their variable exposure to higher academic study, there is little opportunity to put this development into a historical context as a whole. Understanding the evidence-base, or appreciating the lack of it in some cases, is an important part of training but this is rarely presented in a palatable,entertaining form. Part of the &amp;amp;lt;i&amp;amp;gt;Landmark Papers in&amp;amp;lt;/i&amp;amp;gt; series, this book brings together the ten most important papers for each sub-speciality within neurology, covering the full range of major neurological conditions. Papers have been selected by leading international experts, who not only summarizewhat each paper showed, but place them into a wider context that makes a coherent story of how their sub-speciality has developed." />
