  <title>An Uncertain Inheritance - Nell Casey</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this eloquent collection of essays&amp;#8212;from the editor of the national bestseller &lt;em&gt;Unholy Ghost: Writers on Depression&lt;/em&gt;&amp;#8212;contributors reveal their experiences in caring for family through illness and death&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today, thirty million people look after frail family members in their own homes. This number will increase drastically over the next decade&amp;#8212;as baby boomers tiptoe toward old age; as soldiers return home from war wounded, mentally and physically; as a growing number of Americans find themselves caught between the needs of elderly parents and young children; as medical advances extend lives and health insurance fails to cover them. This compelling book offers both literary solace and guidance to the people who find themselves witness to&amp;#8212;and participants in&amp;#8212;the fading lives of their intimates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some of the country&#39;s most accomplished writers offer frank insights and revelations about this complex relationship. Julia Glass describes the tension between giving care&amp;#8212;to her two young sons&amp;#8212;and needing care after being diagnosed with breast cancer; Ann Harleman explores her decision to place her husband in an institution; Sam Lipsyte alternates between dark humor and profound understanding in telling the story of his mother&#39;s battle with cancer; Ann Hood wishes she&#39;d had &lt;em&gt;more&lt;/em&gt; time as a caregiver, to prepare herself for the loss of her daughter; Andrew Solomon examines the humbling experience of returning as an adult to be cared for by his father; cartoonist Stan Mack offers an illustrated piece about the humor and hell of making his way through the medical bureaucracy alongside his partner, Janet; Julia Alvarez writes about the competition between her and her three sisters to be the best daughter as they tend to their ailing parents. &lt;em&gt;An Uncertain Inheritance&lt;/em&gt; examines the caregiving relationship from every angle&amp;#8212;children caring for parents; parents caring for children; sib-lings, spouses, and close friends, all looking after one another&amp;#8212;to reveal the pain, intimacy, and grace that take place in this meaningful connection.&lt;/p&gt;" />
