  <title>But You Look so Good... - Maria J. Gonzalez</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;But You Look So Good - Stories from Carcinoid Cancer Survivors and the basics of Neuroendocrine cancers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This book shares the intimate stories of those living with a poorly understood neuroendocrine cancer and the time it takes to find a correct diagnosis; sometimes years! The book demonstrates how those afflicted with this cancer cope with the myriad symptoms of this great masquerader cancer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Supported by loved ones, the valiant struggles to obtain a correct diagnosis and effective treatments will give the reader a dramatic first-hand look into how our healthcare system often fails to serve each of us, regardless of illness. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More importantly, the stories show the reader how those with this cancer cope. The book also offers information on the various types of this cancer, tests, markers, and scans relevant to NE cancer, as well as tips on how to manage symptoms, side effects of medications, complimentary alternative medicine, quality of life issues, nutrition, and coping. It offers hope, strength, and inspiration to those with this cancer, as well as to their care-givers and all involved with them.&lt;/p&gt;" />
