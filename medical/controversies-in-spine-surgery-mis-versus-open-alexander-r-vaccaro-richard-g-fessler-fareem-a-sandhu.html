  <title>Controversies in Spine Surgery, MIS versus OPEN - Alexander R. Vaccaro, Richard G. Fessler, Fareem A. Sandhu</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Master spine surgeons Alexander R. Vaccaro, Richard G. Fessler, and a cadre of esteemed co-editors have compiled the most comprehensive textbook to date detailing minimally invasive spine (MIS) versus open spine surgery techniques. &lt;em&gt;Controversies in Spine Surgery, MIS versus OPEN: Best Evidence Recommendations&lt;/em&gt; features debates by renowned experts on one of the most provocative topics in spine surgery. Twenty-four chapters systematically organized into four sections &amp;mdash; degenerative, trauma, tumor, and other issues, cover procedures and underlying pathologies, backed by a large, diverse body of literature.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MIS and open approaches are thoroughly compared and contrasted in each chapter. Evidence is presented and analyzed in an objective manner with &#39;opposing sides&#39; presenting differing opinions and techniques, resulting in a synchronous collection of pros and cons. Every chapter is masterfully summed up by the book&#39;s editors &amp;mdash; each of whom have varying stances on the topics at hand. This unique &#39;duel&#39; and &#39;duet&#39; discussion enables readers to assimilate information, benefit from the balanced harmony between divergent opinions, and reach their own conclusions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Key Highlights&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Comparative risks, benefits, complications, and outcomes for a full spectrum of lumbar, thoracic and cervical procedures&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;MIS versus open approaches for lumbar stenosis, synovial cysts, lumbar adjacent segment degeneration, degenerative scoliosis, flatback syndrome, thoracic disc herniation, and dural tears&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Tumor resection and stabilization, quality of life issues, and potential advantages and risks of MIS techniques&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Key differences in MIS versus open operations such as radiation exposure and costs&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Analysis of 3-D navigational imaging to improve outcomes and reduce radiation exposure and operating time&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This book is a tremendous, evidence-based tool to guide spine surgeons as they make important decisions on selecting the most optimal spine surgery techniques.
