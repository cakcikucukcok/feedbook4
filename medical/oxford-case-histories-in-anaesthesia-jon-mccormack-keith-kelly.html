  <title>Oxford Case Histories in Anaesthesia - Jon McCormack, Keith Kelly</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Based around the core curriculum for specialist trainees, Oxford Case Histories in Anaesthesia contains over 60 clinical cases compiled by expert consultants. The cases comprehensively cover all sub-specialties and a broad range of variations that occur in normal and abnormal physiology, pharmacology and pathology, as well as patient age. The cases have been selected with reference to the revised Curriculum for a Certificate of Completion of Training inAnaesthesia set by the Royal College of Anaesthetists.Each case begins with clear learning outcomes and is mapped to the CCT matrix, greatly aiding those revising for the Final FRCA examination. The cases are presented with a background to the subject area, and a summary of the history and examination findings with relevant investigation results. This is followed by several questions on clinically important aspects of the case with answers and detailed discussion, particularly of the differential management options. Further reading at the end ofeach case aids future study.As well as those preparing for the Final FRCA, this book will also be of interest for post-fellowship trainees on specialty attachments and those who occasionally have to anaesthetize out with their normal field of practice, for example in subspecialty emergencies or whilst awaiting retrieval teams to arrive for transfer to tertiary care centres." />
