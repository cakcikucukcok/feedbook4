  <title>Phytochemicals for Diabetic Complications - Ciddi Veeresham, Ajmera Rama Rao</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Diabetes Mellitus (DM) is a chronic metabolic disorder of impaired metabolism of Carbohydrates fats and proteins, characterized by hyperglycemia resulting from decreased utilization of carbohydrates and excessive glycogenolysis and Gluconeogenesis from amino acids and fatty acids. People with Diabetes mellitus are at higher risks of developing serous diabetic complications such as neuropathy, nephropathy, cataract and heart attacks. Four molecular mechanisms are involved in the development of diabetic complications; increase in the flux of glucose through polyol pathway, increased intracellular formation of advanced glycation end products (AGES), activation of protein kinase C (PKC) and increased flux through the hexosamine pathway. Among these polyol pathway plays a vital role in the development of diabetic complication. In view of the researchers started working on the synthetic compounds for the treatment of diabetic complications. The failure of synthetic compounds because of their low safety and poor pharmacokinetics made look into alternative source from plants / phytochemicals. So in view of these the book gives details about several plants and phytochemicals reported for the treatment of diabetic complications.&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp;The book will be valuable for people works as plants/ phytochemicals for treatment of diabetic complications. This book will also useful for the students, Researchers and teachers in the subjects of Pharmacognosy, Botany, Pharmacy, Ayurveda and other Allied Life Sciences.
