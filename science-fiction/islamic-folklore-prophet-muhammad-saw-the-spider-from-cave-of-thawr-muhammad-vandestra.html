  <title>Islamic Folklore Prophet Muhammad SAW &amp; The Spider from Cave of Thawr - Muhammad Vandestra</title>
      <meta name="description" content="I am a spider who is higher in rank than other spiders. With all humility, if all the spiders in this world were put in one hand and I was put in the other I would outweigh them in superiority. I am not one to make false claims and show-off, I am simply stating facts. I do not think that I need to introduce myself to the reader, for I am sure you understand that I am the spider of the cave that the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) hid in. I am the one, who was responsible for the Prophet&amp;#39;s deliverance. I am the one, who Allah (God) sent to protect him.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
My web is very flimsy and light and the slightest breeze can blow it away. However, despite the weakness of my web, I managed to ward off the iron swords of the atheists that went out in pursuit of the Prophet, and moreover, I was able to defeat them! The outcome of the conflict between the spiders&amp;#39; weak silk and the iron of the swords was the defeat of iron. My house is considered a parable of weakness, &amp;quot;Verily, the frailest (weakest) of houses is the spider&amp;#39;s house.&amp;quot; I sat in my house protecting the noble house of Islam and guarding the Prophet of Allah, Muhammad ibn &amp;#39; Abdullah (peace be upon him).That was not all that happened to me. Something even more wonderful happened; I saw the Prophet. I know that after the Prophet&amp;#39;s death, millions will visit his grave to cry and pray." />
