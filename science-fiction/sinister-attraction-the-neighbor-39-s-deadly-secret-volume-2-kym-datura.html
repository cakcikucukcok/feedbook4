  <title>Sinister Attraction: The Neighbor&#39;s Deadly Secret Volume 2 - Kym Datura</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Richard began to look around Martin&#39;s house. He noticed that all the photographs and paintings were very old and there were none that were less than one hundred years old. Richard&#39;s throat began to get dry and he needed something to drink like a glass of water or something. Martin was sitting on the sofa trying to figure out what was going on and had his head in his hands. He didn&#39;t notice Richard go into the kitchen and open the cupboard and take out a wine glass. There was a bottle on the table and Richard assumed it was wine. He poured himself a glass of the liquid and raised the glass to his lips and began to drink it. Once he realized that it wasn&#39;t wine, but blood that he was drinking, he spit the liquid out in the sink. &quot;What the hell!&quot; He yelled out.    He then went to get some water or other cold beverage out of the refrigerator and opened the door and to his horror he saw plastic bags of blood inside. His head started racing and spinning, Richard then passed out." />
