  <title>Search for Lazarus - Johanna Ridenow</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Book two of the Lazarus Trilogy continues the story of Maggie Johnson. She may have changed locations but she still has the same unique way of looking at the world. The headquarters of the North American continent may never be the same. To many this is a good thing. Maggie is on a mission to help her fellow Resurrected that are suffering from a malaise of the spirit. Why were so many disillusioned and unhappy? Why arent the Resurrected rising to the challenge to help the world when the world needs them more now than ever? 
With the help of some old friends and new ones they are trying to find the answers to those questions. But those questions are being noticed. The changes to relight barely burning fires of passion for life are being questioned. Maggie and her friends have stumbled into a deeply buried secret. A deadly secret that someone will kill to keep. A secret that will totally change everything the Resurrected are and turn brother against brother and sister against sister. 
As if one job wasnt enough always in the back of her mind remains an outstanding obligation that has nothing to do with intrigues and everything to do with the soul. Maggie has a journey yet to complete, to follow a loved one into trouble, into danger. How could you make a choice between your heart and your soul? How could she let a loved one be in danger and not do something about it? That answer was all too easy. She couldnt." />
