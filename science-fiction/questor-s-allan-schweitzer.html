  <title>Questor - S. Allan Schweitzer</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The novel &quot;Questor&quot; takes place during the final decade of the 20th century. A research institute is one of the most powerful companies worldwide as it dominates and controls the lives of humanity by virtue of its monumental achievement. The Company Cybele has created and has populated the planet with cloned replicates of living humans, the reasons for which are varied. The main character, Howard Questor, is a clone who has a singular goal or mission; namely,his passion to undergo a mission, which is to search,to investigate and determine the cause and reason for his being, namely, a cloned replicate who has been for unknown reasons, abandoned and discarded by the forces within the Company which created him.  Questor&#39;s purpose is to discover who and why he exists.  He learns, along with several other characters who are involved in his quest,that the Company&#39;s achievements have become a contribution to human knowledge; however, cloning has also instilled within the Company as well as within its many admirers and recipients of Cybele&#39;s accomplishments, the growing desire, motive and establishment of a multinational,dominant and threatening global domination ad dictatorship. In his personal quest, Howard  develops kinship with many who trust him and his mission.  Questor also discovers love and understanding from his relationship with a beautiful woman. Throughout the novel there is a pervasive theme which suggests the possibility that the Company&#39;s cloning achievements were ultimately dependent and made possible based on clues and plans that were left on this planet by extra terrestrial aliens who once visited the earth and who have since been long gone. The visitations of alien life were never proven until evidence was revealed by mankind&#39;s abilities to recreate himself." />
