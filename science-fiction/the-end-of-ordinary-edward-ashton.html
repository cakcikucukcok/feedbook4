  <title>The End of Ordinary - Edward Ashton</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Drew Bergen is an Engineer. He builds living things, one gene at a time. He&amp;#8217;s also kind of a doofus. Six years after the Stupid War&amp;#8212;a bloody, inconclusive clash between the Engineered and the UnAltered&amp;#8212;that&amp;#8217;s a dangerous combination. Hannah is Drew&amp;#8217;s greatest project, modified &lt;em&gt;in utero &lt;/em&gt;to be just a bit more than human. She&amp;#8217;s also his daughter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Drew&amp;#8217;s working on a new project now. He thinks his team is developing a spiffy new strain of corn, but Hannah&amp;#8217;s classmate and her mysterious companion disagree. They think he&amp;#8217;s cooking up the end of the world. When one of Drew&amp;#8217;s team members disappears, he begins to suspect that they might be right. Soon they&amp;#8217;re all in far over their heads, with corporate goons and government operatives hunting them, and millions of lives in the balance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Energetic and bitingly satirical, &lt;em&gt;The End of Ordinary&lt;/em&gt; is a riveting near-future thriller that asks an important question: if we can&amp;#8217;t get along when our differences are barely skin deep, what happens when they run all the way down to the bone?&lt;/p&gt;" />
