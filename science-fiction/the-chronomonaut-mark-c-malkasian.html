  <title>The Chronomonaut - Mark C. Malkasian</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;It started with murder. She knew too much.  I am a time traveler out of necessity. I love her. Im the time traveler, first to do what I just did. I voyaged back and altered history for my wife. I know the proverbs warn that only bad can come from this. Tonight Ill find out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Voyager, 2071&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2071, on Solar7, nineteen-year-old T. C.s heart is shattered by loss when Jewel, his love and a member of the Space Corps, has heard of a mysterious time-erasing chronometer of alien origin. She will soon pay for her curiosity with her life. Desperate and grief-stricken, T. C. enlists in the corps with a secret agenda.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He decides to steal the chronometer so he can travel back in time. Going into his own past, T. C. gives himself eight days to alter history in order to save her. His only desire is to fix things, but in his youthful enthusiasm, hell only make things much worse. Much worse.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;He returns to his own time to find a universe in chaos. Jewel lives, but he doesnt recognize the evil person she has become, and she has no idea who he is. The butterfly effect ripples through the universe, and the young man is lost in a world he cant understand. Hes now an outcast, hunted by her and enemies he didnt even know he had.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Can he set things right with another journey to the past? Will his enemies let him survive long enough to even make the attempt? Only time will tell.&lt;/p&gt;" />
