  <title>The Rock in Room Ten - Mario Fenech</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Joe Simic is fighting gambling addiction and has frequent anxiety attacks. Many of the residents at the rooming house were also dealing with their own mental health issues. The man in the room next to his, David, is in very poor health, and Joe suspects something in that room is the cause of recurrent visions of another world as vivid recollections of his own childhood. Joe is convinced that he has somehow made a connection with something sentient in Davids room. When David is taken to the hospital with little chance of returning, Joe sees a window of opportunity to steal what seems to be a very dark rock from the room. Subsequent visions indicate to Joe that Davids health began to rapidly deteriorate soon after coming into possession of the rock. Joe ascertains from a series of visual messages that the rock wants him to take it to a certain place at a certain time. Despite knowing the danger, Joe decides to assist the rock." />
