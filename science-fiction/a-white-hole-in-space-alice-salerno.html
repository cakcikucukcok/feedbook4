  <title>A White Hole in Space - Alice Salerno</title>
      <meta name="description" content="When an orbiting White Hole rolls through Jennifer Arthurs backyard she, her best friend Willa Walker, and her marmalade cat Atta Girl are swept into it. After a dizzying journey they are marooned in another universe, where everything is white, even the girls. Only Atta Girl retains her rich, tawny hues. 
The three are promptly confronted by the terrible Ghanglers who rule that planets surface. Led by the vicious Tehrran Tuhlla, the Ghanglers use the power of the whirlwind to enforce rigid planetary standards of conformity, going about their relentless business on the individual tornadoes which serve them instead of feet. 
As the girls and Atta flee from a gang of Ghanglers, they are befriended by Morgan, the Magnificent Wandering Wohtt. Morgan resembles a humungous, full-blown dandelion, but his courage and ingenuity make him a lovable and heroic companion. 
Morgan leads them to refuge in the secret, underground nation of Chrystellea, where the citizens have problems of their own. Their leader, Behrrn the Rememberer, has forgotten The Dream, a dream which the people cherish, of color in a colorless universe. Now though, even the cherished memory of color fades, draining from the White World like water from a bathtub.
The sequel, Jennifer Arthur and ALL THE GONE, will be published in the fall of 2006." />
