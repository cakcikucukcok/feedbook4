  <title>Daughters of Eriu - LDR</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Lorcan has been keeping secrets for far too many years. He isn&#39;t even sure who he is anymore. He promised his father he would kill the last descendants of Eriu. He promised the last descendant of Eriu her daughter would have a future. Lorcan doesn&#39;t break promises, and that&#39;s a problem. Who will Lorcan betray...                His father                     or           the Daughters of Eriu?  Aryssa Lyn thought she knew exactly who she was.             ...She was wrong. After taking a new position with her job in Ireland, Aryssa is immersed in a new world she never knew existed. A world she was born into and not everyone is happy about that. Kings, Queens, a handsome prince, magic, ghost, guardians, and if that isn&#39;t enough Aryssa is on at least two peoples hit list. Will she follow the destiny she was born to fulfill? And more importantly can she survive training with the very people who want her death?  Book 1 in the Daughters &amp; Sons of Ireland series." />
