  <title>Reach for the Sky - Christopher Church</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;A bougie addict and his wife hire Mason to hunt for buried loot, but he&amp;rsquo;s not even sure it exists. His psychic insights lead him to an old building with a lot to hide, as well as trying to outwit a Freemason, and getting tangled up with a woman who claims to be rooting out corruption in local government&amp;mdash;but why does she need a psychic to do that? Working undercover for her at city hall, he runs up against some vicious civil servants who will stop at nothing to protect the status quo.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The third installment of the Mason Braithwaite Paranormal Mystery Series finds the bicycle-riding psychic investigator gaining confidence in using his newfound reality-distorting research techniques, struggling with his own rapid evolution while being drawn into unexpected peril as he navigates the shiny heights and gritty underbelly of Los Angeles. Despite his instinct to blame his boyfriend for getting involved with shady people, Ned is always there to provide insight and help pick up the pieces, and their roommate, Peggy, is back on stage and more pregnant than ever. With deft manipulation, Mason cuts through the lies and exposes secrets that are both dark and twisted and incredibly inspiring.&lt;/p&gt;" />
