  <title>Firesoul - Gloria H. Giroux</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;DECADES HAVE PASSED since the bitter war of independence between Ptolem and Osiron. Both planets have settled into a peaceful coexistence, thanks in great part to the efforts of the Ptolemii Triumvirii Pyke and his longtime spouse, Ambassador Prince Vin-Chay. The men and their family have survived incredible personal trials, including a vicious and unexpected attack from long-dead enemies who had set in motion familial and social changes for generations to come. Pyke and Vin-Chay have been linchpins in building a stable, progressive new government for Ptolem, and are living in tranquility and prosperity amongst their large family.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They now find their lives and the very future of their worlds on the precipice of total destruction from an enemy who has risen from the ashes of failure and redefines any imaginable concept of evil. Their last and most desperate battle against the satanic force that relentlessly seeks the obliteration of the Chay family surpasses any horror they have ever endured. They are brought to the edge of madness in a conflagration of bloodthirsty hate, vengeance and passion, an ultimate showdown between good and evil.&lt;/p&gt;" />
