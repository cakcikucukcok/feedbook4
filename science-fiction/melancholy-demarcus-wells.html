  <title>Melancholy - Demarcus Wells</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Earth is no more, and an alien species has rescued the human race from extinction. Years have passed, and the humans have adapted to their new lifestyle on their new planet. They live with two different races, the Serene and the Gargadians, who live in harmony on one planet. But all isnt what it seems.
When the Gargadians and the Serene break out into all-out war with each other, the humans are caught in the middle. Not knowing much about why the war started, the humans side with their rescuers, the Serene. They fight alongside the Serene for a righteous cause, but all isnt what it seems when a team of soldiers stumbles on dark secrets that can bring an empire crashing down. Now the main focus of the team is getting the information to the right people and surviving." />
