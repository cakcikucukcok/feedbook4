  <title>That Special Knack - Douglas J. McGregor</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Jake McCluskie is back&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span&gt;last time, he was the Repairman, and he fixed Time and helped flush a demon back to Oblivion. This time, McCluskie is the Redeemer. He must redeem three souls and find Hells Codes for the Angel of Death. In order to do that, he has to go to Oblivioninto his enemys cage. No wonder the Redeemer always dies.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span&gt;Satan straightened up in the chair and reached into his coat pocket. Oh, I almost forgot. As promised, I read your ghost story book. In his hand he held a hard cover edition of my second book entitled: Limbo, Mississippi: A Ghost Story. The plastic cover book jacket had a library tag.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span&gt;You borrowed it? I asked. From the library?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span&gt;He grinned. Okay, lets call it borrowed.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span&gt;Aw, cmon man, for the love of God, youre an archangel, would it kill you to break open your wallet and buy a copy?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span&gt;Youre rich enough, McCluskie, he said, laughing. Now, for the review. He made a sour face. It was okay, nothing special, but okay. A passing grade. He tapped the book with a finger. The problem is, your story is better than your writing. Hopefully, one day the writing will catch up.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span&gt;Maybe youll like my time travel book better. Its entitled: Broken Time. It just came out.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span&gt;He turned up his nose. I dont know, McCluskie. One of your books is enough for me.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span&gt;You should give this one a chance. The grade ten English classes at Rockaway High School will be reading it this semester.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span&gt;Really? he questioned, his smile beaming. I cant believe it. Jacob McCluskie, part of modern literature. He shook his head, still smiling. The great ones are turning over in their graves.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span&gt;Thanks for your continued support.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span&gt;Anytime, he said, laughing&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />
