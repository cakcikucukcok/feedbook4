  <title>Parallel Missions - Larry L. Sydow</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Derek and Margo Ackerman were an ordinary working couple with grown children, looking forward to retirement in the next five years. Derek, age sixty, is a human-relations consultant for a high-end furnishings manufacturer in Omaha, NE. Margo is the executive secretary for the owner of Aksarben Publishing. By chance, something theyve come to regard as nonexistent, they cross paths with Tomas Talbert who is from a parallel universe. After they saved his life, they took him home with them, Tomas recruits Derek and Margo to join him in creating a team whose purpose is to save not only this world but also his own parallel world. As on Earth, so in Parallel becomes the theme for the rescue missions on which they embark.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a visit to Parallel, which is many hundreds of years advanced scientifically over Earth, they return to their own world rejuvenated and ready for the missions on which they will be sent. In Parallel, they were voluntarily implanted with language chips, allowing them to read, write, and speak numerous languages fluently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With Tomas and his wife, Judith, they make use of an advanced cigar-shaped ship, and Bart, a centuries-advanced computer able to manage rapid transit using wormholes, the space-warp technologies, and the capabilities of the ship. In addition, the team was outfitted with inner and outer suits that cover their entire bodies including multipurpose face masks. All equipment with which they were supplied is in existence or on the drawing boards of scientists in this world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With Barts help, the team turns a simple European vacation into a working one as the team is enlarged and the missions become more dangerous and complex.&lt;/p&gt;" />
