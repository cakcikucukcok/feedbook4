  <title>The Story Behind Life Unveiled - Youth the Writer</title>
      <meta name="description" content="After the mind-boggling and eye-opening insights of his fi rst
four books, the author who prefers to be known as Youth the
Writer stirs the publishing and literary world once again with
the release of the fi nal volume of a series, The Story Behind Life
Unveiled.
Every story has a beginning and an end except life. It is a story
in progress, the author begins. This fi fth volume concludes the
discussion about the truth of life that people live in; the life the
author calls accelerating life. To fully benefi t from this book,
readers must read the authors fi rst four volumes, The Story
behind the Accelerating Life, The Story behind the Current
Revolutions, The Story behind Our Behavior and The Story
behind Life System.
Like his previous books, The Story Behind Life Unveiled
documents a dialogue between the Professor and his student
Ace, which takes place in the authors dreams. The important
information from these occasional meetings provides a class of
people the key for successful gradation and safe awakening
from our current state. When we die, we go back to the real
life, yet to do this, we must graduate fi rst, the author adds.
As a fi tting end to the series, The Story Behind Life Unveiled
contains important lessons and revelations that attempts to
answer questions about life and all its mystery." />
