During the Perseton-Fleet Command joint training exercise a couple of Perseton Battlespheres &quot;accidentally&quot; cross the Jestoid border.  That simple border incident has the potential to cause a war between the Alliance of Planets and the Jestoids, but tempers are calmed and the Alliance warships&quot;head Home&quot; after the exercises are completed.  Yllisium reports for duty at R&amp;D after release from the hospital and is ready to begin his new job with fervor." />
