  <title>Cosmic Fate - Jonathan A. Meyer</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Just another routine mission, thats how it started; Alliance personnel, an alien envoy, and a rendezvous. In the blink of an eye, the captain and crew of the sleek Meridian are slaughtered at the pincers of grotesque insect aliens! Now, little more than stowaways on their hijacked home, Alliance officers Angela Gonzalez and Christopher Peters must find some way to survive. 
Elsewhere in the galaxy, Sanctuary, the prestigious space station and diplomatic center, has been sacked by unknown forces, and its inhabitants twisted into monstrosities! Those few lucky enough to escape the transformation live lives filled with terror as former friends and neighborsnow little more than ravenous beastsprowl the halls looking for their next meal.
In their search for the answers, the officers invite the attention of an unknown puppet master lurking deep in the shadows. The duo is forced apart when Peters is seized by sinister forces, kept alive only for torture and radical experimentation! In the face of a short, horrific future, only the knowledge that Gonzalez remains safe keeps the young mans resistance alive. Yet it is the fear of losing him forever that baits her to venture forth, deep into the heart of darkness." />
