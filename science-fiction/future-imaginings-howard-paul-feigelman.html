  <title>Future Imaginings - Howard Paul Feigelman</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The prehistoric sky is pale blue, and it is cold enough to make frost form almost instantly around the nose and beak of the Pteranodon who has just awakened in a treeless land of ice beyond the reach of the sun. The climate at the North and South Poles is changing, leading to a puzzling consequence that mankind is unable to control or defeat.
As the Pteranodon cranes its long neck and surveys the frigid, unending miles of white in search for food, others prepare to escape the ice prison that has held them in a frozen state for sixty-five million years. Now, in the seemingly endless night, they are alive againthe result of global warming. No one is more aware of the escalating environmental catastrophe than Professor Edgar Hauptman. As he wonders whether time is running out, Hauptman writes a controversial essay that reaches the desk of the President, causing immediate chaos as everyone wonders if mankind is doomed.
In a desperate attempt to cool the earth, Hauptman leads an ambitious mission to the ocean floor. Success means new life, but failure means death of the world as they know it. Can he save the planet in time?" />
