About the Book
I plotted our suns course through space to discover that our sun was born in the constellation Orion. After the planets were formed Earth was covered with a five-mile-thick coating of ice one billion years with an atmospheric pressure of over 750-pounds per square inch. Sunlight could not penetrate such an atmosphere extending 2,500-miles above the planet. We eventually drifted near the Sirius multiple star-system. Little Sirius B (1.5 solar masses) grabbed hold of our sun putting it in orbit around Sirius A.
Earth has lost 98% of its atmosphere (AKA radiation shield). Our sun does not have enough power to keep us out of the ice ages. The additional light and heat from Sirius star system that melted the ice caps and got life started in the oceans. Over time the 750 PSI carbon dioxide atmosphere was laid down as coal, oil and limestone using photosynthesis and light from Sirius A and B. Dinosaurs couldnt live in todays atmosphere because their lungs were too small. 65-million years ago the atmosphere was 30 to 60 PSI. Earth has lost 98% of its atmosphere. It is now 14.5 pounds per square inch. We have a limited time to get our act together and get off the planet to seed life in other biospheres. www.GuardDogBooks.com Wholesale orders (20 or more): www.Trafford.com
