      <meta name="description" content="&quot;Are you getting angry, because I just said &#39;Like a child.&#39; ...?&quot; &quot;I&#39;m a child.&quot; I utter, and then smile. That is the way it is, because I am a professional pilot. It is a profession that adults cannot take.  The war, which is theatrically staged, goes on in the world. &quot;Kildren&quot; (children who are capable of living eternally in adolescence) engage in actual combat operations as daily routines. Which leads to happier existences, to live or to die?  &quot;The Sky Crawlers&quot; has been written by the revolutionary, the one and only author Dr. MORI, Hiroshi. It has been regarded as THE masterpiece by the author himself. This view of the world is brutally innocent enough to fascinate numerous readers. Also, the animation movie version &quot;The Sky Crawlers&quot;, directed by Mamoru Oshii, has attracted global attention.  The English version of &quot;The Sky Crawlers&quot;, the novel series long-awaited by the whole world, has just taken off." />
