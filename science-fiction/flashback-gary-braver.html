  <title>Flashback - Gary Braver</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;If you could relive your childhood, would you? What if you had no choice?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the thirty-fifth anniversary of his parents&#39; mysterious drowning, Jack Koryan returns to his family beach cottage. During a swim, Jack is attacked by a school of rare jellyfish whose toxic stings put him in a coma for three years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When he awakens, he finds that the jellyfish toxin has left him with an extraordinary memory that impresses his doctors. This discovery is complicated by flashbacks: some, pleasant childhood vignettes, others, confusing flashes of violence that leave him quaking in horror.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jack wonders if he&#39;s losing his mind, but that fear is dispelled by Rene Ballard, a pharmacologist working on the world&#39;s first cure for Alzheimer&#39;s Disease. She wants to test Jack because the basis of the drug is the very jellyfish toxin that sent Jack into a coma. And, while several test patients have miraculously regained functionality, others are also experiencing dangerous flashback seizures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ballard&#39;s revelation sets Jack on a quest to discover what is happening to him. He and Rene uncover a sinister pattern of lies and deceit that has left behind a trail of bodies, and several elderly patients stuck in a past that they cannot emerge from--or don&#39;t want to.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the Publisher&#39;s request, this title is being sold without Digital Rights Management Software (DRM) applied.&lt;/p&gt;" />
