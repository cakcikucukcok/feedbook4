In attempt to pull his son from the grips of the Technological Age, Kenneth relocates himself and his son to India, where they both learn what it really means to be human. As their chosen paths reap globally disastrous conclusions, Paul realizes that the real world cannot be replicated, and Kenneth must learn to accept his son for the man that he has become." />
