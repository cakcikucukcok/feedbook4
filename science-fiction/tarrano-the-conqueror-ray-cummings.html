  <title>Tarrano the Conqueror - Ray Cummings</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;i&gt;In &amp;quot;Tarrano the Conqueror&amp;quot; is presented a tale of the year 2430 A.D.&amp;mdash;a time somewhat farther beyond our present-day era than we are beyond Columbus&amp;#39; discovery of America. My desire has been to create for you the impression that you have suddenly been plunged forward into that time&amp;mdash;to give you the feeling Columbus might have had could he have read a novel of our present-day life.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;i&gt;To this end I have conceived myself a writer of that future time, addressing his contemporary public. You are to imagine yourself reading a present day translation of my original text&amp;mdash;a translation so free that a thousand little colloquialisms will have crept into it that could not possibly have their counterparts in the year 2430.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Apart from the text, you will occasionally find brief explanatory footnotes. Conceive them as having been put there by the translator.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;i&gt;If you find parts of this tale unusual or bizarre, please remember that we are living now in a comparatively ignorant day. The tale is not intended to be fantastic or full of new and strange ideas. I have used nothing but those developments of our present-day civilization to which we are all looking forward as logical probabilities&amp;mdash;woven them into a picture of what life in America very probably will be five hundred years from now. To that extent, the tale itself is intended to be only a love story of adventure and romance&amp;mdash;written, not for you, but for that future audience.&lt;/i&gt;" />
