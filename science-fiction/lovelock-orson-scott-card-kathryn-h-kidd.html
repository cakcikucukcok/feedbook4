  <title>Lovelock - Orson Scott Card, Kathryn H. Kidd</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Bestselling author Orson Scott Card teams up with the talented Kathyrn H. Kidd to create a startling look at the ethics of bioengineering &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lovelock is a capuchin monkey engineered to be the perfect servant--intelligent, agile, pliant, and devoted to his owner. He is a Witness--privileged to spend his days and nights observing the life of one of Earth&#39;s most brilliant scientists through digital recording devices behind his eyes. In his heart is the desire to please, not just to avoid the pain his owner can inflict with a word, but because he loves her.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lovelock is on a voyage he did not choose. What human would consider the feelings of a capuchin monkey, no matter how enhanced? But Lovelock is something special among Witnesses--he&#39;s a little smarter than most humans; smart enough to break through some of his conditioning. Smart enough to feel the bonds of slavery, and want freedom.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the Publisher&#39;s request, this title is being sold without Digital Rights Management Software (DRM) applied.&lt;/p&gt;" />
