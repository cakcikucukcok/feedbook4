  <title>The Ice Trader - E. R. Bridgman</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;WARNING: Slow readers, do not read before bed time!
Fast readers, go ahead and dig for that happy(?) ending.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Ice Trader&lt;/i&gt; starts this intensely suspenseful and suspensefully intense tale deep in the past of our galaxy where the species were all benevolent. Then an outside force entered and destroyed the peace of the entire galaxy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thousands of years later, one female alien is left upon Earth. Sickened by Earths viruses, germs and diseases, she struggles against all odds to finish her assignment: to prepare Earth for her kind to invade this blue planet for the sake of its abundant water. She and her friend, who died about a decade earlier, had taken many Earth people captive and made them icy meals. However, at the time the ability of the two was not enough to allow the upcoming invasion force to un-terra-form the Earth for their own kind and to make it into a second frigid home world, turning all humans into icy delicacies for the to trade with other species of the galaxy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tom Andrews, the Earth-man hero, becomes the hero of not only the Earth, but of all species that remained true to their benevolent beginnings. The evil is eradicated and everything, except for the extinguished specie of extreme evil, returns back to normal in more ways than one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The author would recommend 99.999 percent of this book to the general readership of G-rated science fiction. The remainder, though not sexual, involves one rather intense scene on two pages of chapter eight that involves the alien female upon the lap of the yet-to-be hero, inquisitive as to the so-called romance packages that are vagrantly displayed upon Earth television and movies. One particular kind of a television program has her most intrigued: soap operas. Kids grow up too fast in todays culture, and it may not be suitable for pre-teens and some teenagers. There is no sex portrayed within the book, but the author would suggest that parents carefully read and determine their own childs individual ability before allowing them read it. Its on two pages within Chapter 8.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Ice Trader&lt;/i&gt; is full of intensity and suspense, but does not lack moments of humor, love, and romance. This is definitely one book not to be missed, and the ending alone is well-worth the read.&lt;/p&gt;" />
