  <title>In Those Days - Myra Jo Golden</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;In Those Days is a novel of history, prophecy, and romance. The Bible says But as the days of Noah were, so also will the coming of the Son of Man be (Matthew 24:37). In other words, the last days will be like the days of Noah. If you take that literally, then they were a society like us, an advanced society. Is it possible they were smarter than us and perhaps more advanced? Did they try to improve us, and are some of the genetic problems we see today because of that improvement?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a love story from those days. Sharon met Shamie when she was still a young girl. She liked him immediately, and he liked her. Years later, when he asked her to come to the project and marry him, she was torn. She had planned all her life to become a reporter, like her parents, and she just wasnt ready to give that up.&lt;/p&gt;" />
