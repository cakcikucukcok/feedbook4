  <title>Ky - Richard Wayne Bobholz</title>
      <meta name="description" content="When mankind longs for hope above all else, a seventeen-year-old boy named Ky emerges exhibiting traits beyond that of a normal human. Realizing his prowess, political and military leaders exploit his ability to sway masses to their own personal gain. Through deception and sacrifice, Ky learns what he must do to save humans from extinction.
Having lost his parents at age twelve to the powers that ran Earth, Ky faces the ultimate decision between helping save Earth, or seeking revenge for what they had done. Seemingly around every corner, powerful individuals strive to oppose Ky by whatever force they can muster. Battle after battle, Ky develops into the person he must become to fulfill the choices he has made, and each choice leads to greater conflict until he is faced with the grandest peril of them all. Can he do what is necessary to save Earth, or will he carry his revenge?" />
