  <title>Reflection - W. Scott Causey</title>
      <meta name="description" content="By the year 2126, CEO Carlton Ferguson and his immensely powerful corporation have already introduced the world to Reflection Technology, a means to view any event that has happened in a previous forty-eight-hour window. Effectively ridding the world of crime, the technology is far too valuable for society to abandon but too dangerous for one person to control. Still, Carlton is determined that he, and he alone, should hold the key to this Pandoras box and finds himself in a battle to keep what is his. Further, he is secretly deep within the process of enhancing the technology to go far beyond a mere two-day limit and does not intend to stop until he can witness the very beginning of time itself. Governments covet the technology, while world faiths fear it will unmask the very gods to whom they pray. Though their goals may be mutually exclusive, religious and political opponents conspire to force Carlton into revealing his secrets. With few available options, Carlton agrees to a tenuous partnership with the United States government but quickly learns that his innate reluctance to freely offer his trust is justified." />
