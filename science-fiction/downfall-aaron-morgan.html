  <title>Downfall - Aaron Morgan</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The year is 2237. The world has changed, the technology far more advanced than the human mind could have imagined. But along with innovation, and the passage of time, comes the need for power. The Administration-a group of men, women, and children who have given their lives to taking over the futuristic landscape of the land of the free-have finally put their pledge into action. They are not only taking over the land of the free, but they have expanded their plot to take over the world as well. Enter the life of John Kennedy, an average, everyday, 16-year-old who has the same worries as anyone else. But all of this changes, when the change in democracy, the change in power, and the change in not only his life but the life of every human on the planet is altered forever. With most of his family gone, and everything he has known and even grown up with disappearing before his eyes, can he bring the Downfall of this mysterious &quot;Administration&quot;? Or, will he bring the Downfall upon himself?" />
