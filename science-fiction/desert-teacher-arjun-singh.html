  <title>Desert Teacher - Arjun Singh</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This book is a collection of short stories. Its based on my lifes experiences. In most of stories, characters are taken from my family. I tried my best to explain how a man can make a fine balance between tradition and modernization. 
My stories are my life experiences. India is such a rich, complex stew of contradictions, of ancient traditions and cutting-edge modernity, and of gregariousness and sly reserve. My voice as a teacher is important and authentic because I have the unique experience of being of two worldsthe rural Thar Desert and the educated city life of Jaisalmer and Jodhpur, not to mention my travels to Connecticut and New York and Washington. Taken together, the arc of my stories paints a clear picture of how India is evolving, especially rural India. There is a lovely thread of opening to new ideas generation by generation that my family represents. I am living this in such a conscious way that, although its maddening or heartbreaking sometimes, I also see the whole and have become wise enough to appreciate my place in all this. 
Jaisalmer, my town is popular among tourist all over world. Nicknamed golden city, it is famous for its prestigious history and unique beauty. My stories present a picture of life of people who live here." />
