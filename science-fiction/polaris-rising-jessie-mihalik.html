As the fifth of six children, Ada von Hasenberg has no authority; her only value to her High House is as a pawn in a political marriage. When her father arranges for her to wed a noble from House Rockhurst, a man she neither wants nor loves, Ada seizes control of her own destiny. The spirited princess flees before the betrothal ceremony and disappears among the stars. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ada eluded her father&amp;#8217;s forces for two years, but now her luck has run out. To ensure she cannot escape again, the fiery princess is thrown into a prison cell with Marcus Loch. Known as the Devil of Fornax Zero, Loch is rumored to have killed his entire chain of command during the Fornax Rebellion, and the Consortium wants his head.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the ship returning them to Earth is attacked by a battle cruiser from rival House Rockhurst, Ada realizes that if her jilted fianc&amp;#233; captures her, she&amp;#8217;ll become a political prisoner and a liability to her House. Her only hope is to strike a deal with the dangerous fugitive: a fortune if he helps her escape.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But when you make a deal with an irresistibly attractive Devil, you may lose more than you bargained for . . .&lt;/p&gt;" />
