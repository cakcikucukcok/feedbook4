  <title>The Rescue - H.P. Kabir</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The Medallion is a prequel to The Rescue, a science-fiction novel by the same author.
In The Medallion, a rogue planet happened to come to the vicinity of the sun and was placed in the solar system, but before it did, some managed to land on Earth and made it their home. For some time, they were not aware of their worlds predicament. It all began fifteen thousand years ago. 
A medallion was given to a trusted person by the aliens, which was misplaced. When found many years later, it led to an adventure that triggered the worlds disbelief in the message it contained. Disappointed with the reception it received, the aliens decided to leave Earth and go back to their planet, which was comfortably placed in the solar system.
Ten years later, in The Rescue, Earth was threatened by an asteroid that would have wiped out all life. However, it was spotted by the aliens and destroyed. 
They decided to visit and tell the world. They were surprised to find an alien adversary whom they had banished years before had returned, had an unchallenged rheostat on robbing gold, and hypnotically controlled the populace. They were forcibly removed, and subsequently, their world was eradicated. The visiting aliens helped to restore order in the chaotic world and meant well to introduce a New World Order to bring peace and harmony. It was not received favorably, but with some persuasion, it made an offer they could not refuse!" />
