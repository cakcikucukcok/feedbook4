      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;From the &lt;i&gt;New York Times &lt;/i&gt;bestselling author of the Three-Body Trilogy, Cixin Liu&#39;s &lt;i&gt;Ball Lightning&lt;/i&gt; is the story of what happens when the beauty of scientific inquiry runs up against the drive to harness new discoveries with no consideration of their possible consequences.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Chen&#39;s parents are incinerated before his eyes by a blast of ball lightning, he devotes his life to cracking the secret of this mysterious natural phenomenon. His search takes him to stormy mountaintops, an experimental military weapons lab, and an old Soviet science station. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The more he learns, the more he comes to realize that ball lightning is just the tip of an entirely new frontier. While Chen&#39;s quest for answers gives purpose to his lonely life, it also pits him against soldiers and scientists with motives of their own: a beautiful army major with an obsession with dangerous weaponry, and a physicist who has no place for ethical considerations in his single-minded pursuit of knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&quot;Wildly imaginative.&quot;--Barack Obama on The Three-Body Problem trilogy&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tor books by Cixin Liu&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;u&gt;The Remembrance of Earth&#39;s Past&lt;/u&gt;&lt;br&gt;#1&lt;i&gt; The Three-Body Problem&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;#2&lt;i&gt; The Dark Forest&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;#3&lt;i&gt; Death&#39;s End&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the Publisher&#39;s request, this title is being sold without Digital Rights Management Software (DRM) applied.&lt;/p&gt;" />
