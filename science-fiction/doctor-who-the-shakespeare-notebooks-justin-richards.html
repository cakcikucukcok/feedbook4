  <title>Doctor Who: The Shakespeare Notebooks - Justin Richards</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Many people know about William Shakespeare&amp;#39;s famous encounter with the &lt;em&gt;Doctor&lt;/em&gt; at the Globe Theatre in 1599. But what few people know (&lt;em&gt;though many have suspected&lt;/em&gt;) is that it was not the first time they met.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Drawn from recently discovered archives, &lt;em&gt;The Shakespeare Notebooks&lt;/em&gt; is the holy grail for Bard scholars: conclusive proof that the Doctor not only appeared throughout Shakespeare&amp;#39;s life but also had a significant impact on his writing. In these pages you&amp;#39;ll find early drafts of scenes and notes for characters that never appeared in the plays; discarded lines of dialogue and sonnets; never-before-seen journal entries; and much more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From the original notes for &lt;em&gt;Hamlet&lt;/em&gt; (with a very different appearance by the ghost) and revealing early versions of the faeries of &lt;em&gt;A Midsummer Night&amp;#39;s Dream&lt;/em&gt; to strange stage directions revised to remove references to a mysterious blue box, &lt;em&gt;The Shakespeare Notebooks&lt;/em&gt; is an astonishing document that offers a unique insight into the mind of one of history&amp;#39;s most respected and admired figures. And also, of course, William Shakespeare.&lt;/p&gt;" />
