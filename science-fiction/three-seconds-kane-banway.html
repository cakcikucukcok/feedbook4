  <title>Three Seconds - Kane Banway</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;i&gt; “Use our T-Gate and be at your meeting in exactly three seconds!  Tired of the subway and its smells, the bus and its noise!  Take our T-Gate and forget those archaic times when the duration of a trip was a criterion for travel!*”&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;i&gt;*Subject to status, property of Fast Food inc.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
Jack is a loving father.  And as a perfect husband, he must please his wife who doesn’t want to spend 7 hours in a car when they could use a T-Gate and reach their destination in exactly three seconds.&lt;br/&gt;
Except that Jack doesn’t like T-Gates… But he loves his wife, so…&lt;br/&gt;
What wouldn’t a man do, for the love of his life?&lt;br/&gt;
A short story without pretension other than to entertain you for a little while…&lt;br/&gt;
P.S: If you liked this short story, please share or comment: negative or positive – because nothing’s perfect –, you have no idea of the impact it could have on an author in the making…&lt;br/&gt;" />
