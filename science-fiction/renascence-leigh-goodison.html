      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;It is 2072. Pollution and preemptive nuclear strikes have rendered Earth uninhabitable. Individual countries no longer exist. Earth is now governed by a World Order of Leaders that dispatches a team of six young scientists, led by a former Marine, to establish a base for future inhabitation on a planet with the highest Earth Simulation Index.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Upon landing, Zeta, the group&amp;rsquo;s chemist, discovers they have been double-crossed by Captain Reynard who, before dismantling the communications system, diverted the flight to another planet and reported back that the team did not survive the voyage.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Then one of the team disappears and the others take Reynard prisoner until they can return him to Earth. But while preparing for departure they encounter the alien species that captured their teammate, and find themselves entangled in a space exploration mystery that has persisted for over two centuries.&lt;/p&gt;" />
