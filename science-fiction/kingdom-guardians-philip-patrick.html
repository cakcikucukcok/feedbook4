  <title>Kingdom Guardians - Philip Patrick</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Young teenager Elijah Khoda from Burns Lake lives an ordinary life but not your typical teenager style. He often faced extraordinary circumstances of his own. Then one day he comes across a silver key with no idea of where it came from or what its for. Before he knows it, he and five of his peers are transported to an outer world called Kingdom Planet by a sorcerer name Ohuran. They learn what the silver key is for, to unlock great powers that once belonged to a group of warriors call Kingdom Guardians, and they were chosen to inherit it, for reasons they dont quite understand at first. They also learn that a ruthless Prince has wanted the powers for himself for some time. After an incident causes the good to meet with the evil, the Prince gets motivated and then declares war on these six teenagers. So Elijah has no choice but to lead five of his peers into the face of danger, in order to become the new Kingdom Guardians and fight against the Prince and his army. Along the way, strength and courage are discovered; a friendship builds from a journey that would change their lives forever." />
