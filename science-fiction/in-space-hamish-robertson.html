  <title>In Space - Hamish Robertson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This book is all about space travel. It explores possibilities including teletransportation, walking through walls and portals using the power of a God like matter called Petra. She does most things for some species leaving the them little to do which creates a stale life with little reward for endeavour. She lacks empathy unlike our God and is responsible for the incarceration of the transcendentals whom she uses to ease travel and interaction with what I call the Ultra World. She is in no way evil but lacks empathy she sees only as a calculator and she is kind but her over involvement with life is seen as unbalancing there is less for the people to do so endeavour seems less rewarded. A place where their houses refuse to be castles though they are made from the same brick.
	The decent people of the galaxy find themselves facing a tyrant called Histler who threatens to destroy everything in his search for domination. Closer to home there is Armageddon on Earth where salvation is found in space thanks to Jesus and a planet called Donfrice. I have employed an idea of things echoing around our galaxy and I call it symbiotic symmetry. Space is very large and to be lost can be very exhausting both mentally and physically. Sanity however is saved with a spiral of accounts joining people and idea together.
	This book is a tale of many journeys and of many people whose interaction involvement and development I hope will capture you." />
