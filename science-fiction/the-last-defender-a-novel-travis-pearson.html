  <title>The Last Defender: A Novel - Travis Pearson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Soon after a population desperate for change elects a charismatic yet radical government leader, people begin vanishing without media coverage or bodies to recover. As the new socialist leader rules without compassion, steals the wealth of the country, and controls every aspect of the citizens&#39; lives, one man decides to take action.   Brent Stevens, a brilliant researcher intent on unlocking the power of the mind, lived a perfect middle-class existence before the new government robbed him of everything and attacked his only friend. Determined to help humankind, he launches a revolt against the all-powerful government. But when he is stonewalled by a powerful bureaucracy determined to institute their brutal agenda, Brent must become the country&#39;s last defender. As he bravely challenges a dark destiny, the clock ticks away as he wonders if he can save his country-and its people-from a bleak future." />
