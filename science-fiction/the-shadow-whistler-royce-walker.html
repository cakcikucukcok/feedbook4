  <title>The Shadow Whistler - Royce Walker</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The normally quiet life in a small, rural town is ripped apart by a series of strange and violent deaths. The sight of brutally dismembered bodies is becoming disturbingly commonplace in a place where this sort of crime was once unthinkable. All the townspeople know is that a dangerous predator keeps striking from the shadows and that no one is safe from its insatiable appetites. There have been a few sightings, but no one can really describe what theyve seen. What appears at first glance to be a gray man shifts into something far more elusive upon closer inspection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the help of a horse she rescues and the wayward spirit of her Confederate soldier great-grandfather, two most unlikely championsthe towns veterinarian and her young daughteremerge. Hoping to make a deal and solve the mystery, the vets daughter makes a strange deal with a powerful yet shy entity whose true intentions are as mysterious as the deaths. This entitys power reaches across time and existence, even into the creation of entire worlds and civilizations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The stakes couldnt be higher: the fate of the soldiers soul hangs in the balance, as does the continued existence of his descendents. A battle is building between unknown forces, and the collision between them has the potential to change their destinies and future memories for all involved.&lt;/p&gt;" />
