  <title>Invitations from Afar - Linda A.W. King</title>
      <meta name="description" content="After fulfilling every objective of a top secret mission to Jupiters Ganymede
and now only days from home, four NASA astronauts learn from their computer
systems analyst in Houston through an unauthorized channel that a bomb may
be on a rendezvous course with their ship, the Copernicus.
Mission Specialist Jana Novacek, the youngest astronaut ever, who has been
chosen for mysterious reasons, suggests breaking security, announcing their
existence to everyone over the net, and asking for help. Someone might be
willing to help who unknowingly is involved in the plot against them. Cocommander
Fawzshen, Prince of Rhatania, further recommends revealing their
amazing discovery.
Commander Jackson Medwin thinks that Janas journal is ideal for that purpose.
Jana is distressed and feels her personal journal is not suitable.
Commander Medwin will do anything to save his crew, this mission, and their
discovery, but he decides neither to take evasive actions nor break security until
they have proof that something is on a collision course with their ship. He
considers a deactivated meteoroid detection program uploaded to them from
Houston as insufficient proof." />
