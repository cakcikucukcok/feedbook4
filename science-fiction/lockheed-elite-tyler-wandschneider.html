      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Working to pay off a blackmailer who has learned that a certain genius mechanic isn&amp;rsquo;t as dead as he was made out to be, Anders Lockheed takes his team on their biggest salvage op yet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, Anders has hired an undercover military operative bent on using them as bait to draw out a mastermind who has been attacking the public with deadly mechs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While on the scav op, things go from bad to worse as the crew of &lt;em&gt;Elite One&lt;/em&gt; recover an abandoned woman aboard the claim. Now Anders must decide quickly&amp;mdash;stay and fight or cut cables and run.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Either way, it&amp;rsquo;s too late. Someone has other plans for them. The trap has been set, they&amp;rsquo;ve rescued the woman and taken the bait, and before long Anders and what&amp;rsquo;s left of his dwindling crew must navigate with caution through the grips of the military and an especially vile outlaw.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Anders doesn&amp;rsquo;t captain just another team flying the black. With a genius mechanic who uses his ragtag high-tech machine shop to aid them in getting in and out of trouble, they&amp;rsquo;ve earned a reputation as the best of the best. With Anders&amp;rsquo;s careful planning, this motley crew must band together and flip the military to use them on a monster heist and dig themselves out from the heat pressing in from both sides of the law.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fly with them. They are clever, they are fierce, they are &lt;em&gt;Lockheed Elite&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;" />
