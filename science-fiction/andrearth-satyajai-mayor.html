  <title>Andrearth - Satyajai Mayor</title>
      <meta name="description" content="A Quest For Kindred Spirits Across Galactic Frontiers
Youre a very good writer and this is a breathtaking book, full of astoundingly BIG IDEAS about BIG subjects.
					Stephen Espie, former Text editor, Time Life 
Rays growing years are marred by strange voices in his mind. He joins the Search for Extra Terrestrial Intelligence ( SETI) program, and receives a powerful signal which he finds is related to his childhood experiences. He is determinded to follow this through but his grant is withdrawn. His mother introduces him to a meditation Master who initiates him into the practice. This leads him on a parallel track to trace the antecedents of the signal, taking him to his mothers village in the southern state of India, Kerala. The mystery unfolds in his journey to  find the answers.
... a pacy mystical sci fi novel focussing on spirituality, human potential, love and reincarnation,and the existence of human life on a more enlightened plane in another galaxy...
Mayor has created a thought-provoking what if? scenario that is, at the same time, entertaining. 
					Literary Editor in London
You write very expressively, and have certainly found your voice. 									Karen Scott, Author &amp; Editor
An excellent novel with intriguing notions and vast conceptions meant for readers of all genres, and of all ages.
