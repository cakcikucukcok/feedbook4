  <title>LEGACY: EPISODE II - Robert Maxxim</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Legacy, a novel 30 years in the making, is a futuristic story of mankind&amp;rsquo;s previous sojourns through this and countless worlds as experienced by the author. It describes one man&amp;rsquo;s incredible journey through several lifetimes as far back as a million years, his blunders and triumphs, and the many worlds and places where these took place. The novel highlights advanced scientific and spiritual concepts, written in lyrical romantic prose. But most of all, it is a powerful love story deeply rooted in his unquenchable desperate search through the vastness of space and time for his one; his soul mate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Far back in time, the story&amp;rsquo;s main character was a spiritual initiate who was misled by a wayward master and followed a path of aggression. In doing so, he lost his one and from that point forward led countless lives serving his wayward master&amp;rsquo;s evil space alliance, known at the time as the Unholy Six. He became a cosmic military oppressor determined to conquer and terrorize the galaxy. But eventually, he is reborn on Dallian, a planet in Sagittarius home of the resistance against the Alliance. Here, he meets his one and helps Dallians achieve victory over the evil space power, thus undoing what he at one time helped create.&lt;/p&gt;" />
