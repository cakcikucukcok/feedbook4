In this perilous place of wild beasts, outmoded technologies, and harsh seasonal change, a fragile peace exists between the distrustful &lt;em&gt;hakoi&lt;/em&gt; and the hated Devi, held together by an iron-clad Protocol&amp;mdash;whose laws, if broken, could lead to war.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;She will discover an ally in the kindly village healer Hyme and a dangerous adversary in Kepten Yose, her subordinate. But the gravest threat to Tehi&amp;rsquo;s future is the Mjoran chief, the charismatic, golden-haired Laerd Teger, whose elusiveness and cool disdain the Moreva finds both infuriating and fascinating.&amp;nbsp; For it is he who will impel her to break her most sacred vows and seek out the dark secrets of her gods and her world, setting them both on a course that can only lead to damnation and death.&lt;/p&gt;" />
