  <title>The Ideal - Stanley Weinbaum</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;i&gt;&amp;quot;This,&amp;quot; said the Franciscan, &amp;quot;is my Automaton, who at the proper time will speak, answer whatsoever question I may ask, and reveal all secret knowledge to me.&amp;quot; He smiled as he laid his hand affectionately on the iron skull that topped the pedestal. The youth gazed open-mouthed, first at the head and then at the Friar. &amp;quot;But it&amp;#39;s iron!&amp;quot; he whispered. &amp;quot;The head is iron, good father.&amp;quot; &amp;quot;Iron without, skill within, my son,&amp;quot; said Roger Bacon. &amp;quot;It will speak, at the proper time and in its own manner, for so have I made it. A clever man can twist the devil&amp;#39;s arts to God&amp;#39;s ends, thereby cheating the fiend&amp;mdash;Sst! There sounds vespers!&lt;/i&gt;&amp;nbsp;Plena gratia, ave Virgo&amp;mdash;&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;i&gt;But it did not speak. Long hours, long weeks, the&lt;/i&gt;&amp;nbsp;doctor mirabilis&amp;nbsp;&lt;i&gt;watched his creation, but iron lips were silent and the iron eyes dull, and no voice but the great man&amp;#39;s own sounded in his monkish cell, nor was there ever an answer to all the questions that he asked&amp;mdash;until one day when he sat surveying his work, composing a letter to Duns Scotus in distant Cologne&amp;mdash;one day&amp;mdash;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;i&gt;&amp;quot;Time is!&amp;quot; said the image, and smiled benignly.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;i&gt;The Friar looked up. &amp;quot;Time is, indeed,&amp;quot; he echoed. &amp;quot;Time it is that you give utterance, and to some assertion less obvious than that time is. For of course time is, else there were nothing at all. Without time&amp;mdash;&amp;quot;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;i&gt;&amp;quot;Time was!&amp;quot; rumbled the image, still smiling, but sternly at the statue of Draco.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;i&gt;&amp;quot;Indeed time was,&amp;quot; said the Monk. &amp;quot;Time was, is, and will be, for time is that medium in which events occur. Matter exists in space, but events&amp;mdash;&amp;quot;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;i&gt;The image smiled no longer. &amp;quot;Time is past!&amp;quot; it roared in tones deep as the cathedral bell outside, and burst into ten thousand pieces&lt;/i&gt;." />
