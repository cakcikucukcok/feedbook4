  <title>Neither Here nor There - Richard J Sullivan</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Richs family is ecstatic to have the chance to attend a wedding in South America. They board flight 1957 in New York, headed for Rio de Janeiro. Sadly, they never reach their destination. The pilot eventually has to make an emergency landing, but hijacking would have been a more favorable situation as Rich and his family find themselves stuck.&lt;br&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Not only are they in a mysterious place, but they are also in a mysterious when. Time and space have seemingly disappeared, and communication with the outside world is nonexistent. Rich, his family, and over two hundred other passengers must work together to find a way to survive in a place that is neither here nor there.&lt;br&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;When pistols end up in the wrong handsand resources run lowdeath seems the likely conclusion, but is death even possible in this strange land? To stay alive, passengers must explore unknown horizons, make friends with wild natives, and get along with each other in this tall tale that is part Survivor, Star Trek, Lost in Space, and Twilight Zone.&lt;/p&gt;" />
