      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;To save her world, Tesh leaves everything behind and shapes a new future into the past.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the technologically driven society of 2098, Tesh is groomed to fulfill her future role as the leader of the SRC conclave, under the tender care of her parents and the mentoring of DAINN, the planetary system overseeing the infrastructure of an entire world&amp;hellip; Until events rip apart the fabric of her young life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, part of the Institute conclave, against her will, she seeks freedom from those who want to control her. In a world where her mind is a powerful asset, she fights to write her own destiny amidst hidden agendas, and take her place with the young leaders of the next generation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Only, the golden city of Ang standing as the crowned jewel of man&amp;rsquo;s achievement, against the rough landscapes of a Planet in turmoil, faces impending doom. Under domes operated by the A.I. DAINN safeguarding the population against violent climatic storms, the Perfect Humans, having evolved into smarter, faster, stronger and better versions of ourselves with enhanced genetics and implants, must overcome a cataclysm about to destroy everything on Earth&amp;rsquo;s surface.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the anomaly looms on the horizon, the Council of Nations implements four different programs, Alpha, Origin, Provenance and Aurora in an effort to save their civilization. The Origin program, standing separate from the others, is meant to change outcomes. Tesh, leads her team and enters the safety complex with Leane, Streak and Blast and members of the four other conclaves.

With the help of new friends, Chase and Gen, they endeavor to change what tomorrow brings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first volume of this saga spans many years and multiple lifetimes, crossing over to other realms beyond that of our dimension.&lt;/p&gt;" />
