  <title>Game Ender Volume Three - B. James Patterson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Life is hard. Staying agile is a must, even when you&#39;re tired. Raven is tired. She&#39;s tired of needing a cool head and a steady hand. She&#39;s tired of her ready gun always finding ways out of a bad situation, and soon she&#39;s going to make a mistake. If she&#39;s lucky, her brother Gideon will be there to help her when her luck runs out, but a battle is coming. This battle can&#39;t be won and she knows it. Worse, she&#39;s the only one who knows the terrain and tactics needed just to survive. She&#39;ll have to convince Major Richardson she can not only fight with seasoned soldiers, but lead them as well. Things begin to get out of hand when Jake Ryder shows up. War, profiteering, and greed are a bad mixture, Jake makes them a hobby. Betrayal sucks and can hurt like hell but sometimes you have to trust the people around you. Like a bad poker hand she&#39;ll have to make the best use of the people she was dealt. Are they worthy? Is it the smart thing to do? She&#39;ll have to find out along the way because time has run out for Raven." />
