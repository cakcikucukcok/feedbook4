  <title>The Ants of Lord’S Hill - Greg Savoy</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Most people on Earth think General Tom Johnson is dead. Some days, he thinks hes dead also. The poor guy certainly had to give up every bit of his life when the President asked him to build a secret city
deep under a mountain somewhere in America. So nobody was going to fault the overworked General when he broke the rules of secrecy and made contact with a small boy in the outside world, a very
inquisitive boy named Andrew Ebbitt.&lt;p&gt;
Living all alone with his mom in a nearby mountain home, Andrew was a prime candidate for a secret friendship. But it didnt stop there, not at all. After digging into Toms world for two whole decades,
Andrew Ebbitt ends up pulling off Earths most heinous and heroic act. Until Andrew Ebbitt came along, those two words, heinous and heroic, had never been used to describe a single act by one person.&lt;p&gt;
Essentially a cookbook for making secret cities, this tale reveals the covert sciences and technologies that are held by America today. The tale also explains why it wouldnt be good if you knew all this. Get ready and prepare some snacks. This rides
going to be a good one." />
