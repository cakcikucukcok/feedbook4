  <title>Da Bonemon - Bob Harrison</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;A killer has returned. Nearly two decades after a series of murders, bodies are again appearing in the Appalachians. Special Agent Truman Eisenhauer arrives in the rugged mountains bordering the Great Smoky Mountains National Park where he and local sheriff Bill Watson investigate the latest bizarre murder.&lt;P&gt;Theories abound about the strange, ritualistic murders, but Eisenhauer has his own ideasideas that dont turn to the supernatural. &lt;P&gt;Confronting the mystifying had become his specialty at the FBI, but Eisenhauer was unprepared for what waited for him in the backwoods of North Carolina. Virtually nothing fit his preconceived notions of the area or of crime itself. Both an obvious pattern and an obvious signature existed for this serial killer, but that helped neither he nor Bill Watson in their initial pursuit of the killer. It was not until Eisenhauer began to confront his own past that the glimmer of an answer appeareda solution he did not want to find.&lt;P&gt;Set the rich and storied woods of rural America and populated with a cast of just slightly off-center characters, Da Bonemon is a novel of mystery, horror, and comedy, and is definitely not a book for younger readers or for those people who are offended by sex and violence.&lt;/P&gt;" />
