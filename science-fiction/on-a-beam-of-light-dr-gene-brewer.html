  <title>On a Beam of Light - Dr. Gene Brewer</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Five years to the day, almost to the second, after he disappeared form the Manhattan Psychiatric Institute, leaving his host body in a catatonic state, the being known as prot (rhymes with goat) has returned. Now, in sixteen more sessions with psychiatrist Gene Brewer, prot reveals that he has come back to escort a chosen few to his home planet, K-PAX.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;K-PAX is an idyllic planet free of the pain and suffering of earth. Prot has incredible insights into how to cure that suffering, and his radical ideas have made him a celebrity. Now, legions of people are longing to follow him home.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Dr. Brewer has heard it before. Five years ago, he discovered another person buried deep in prot&#39;s personality: Robert Porter of Montana. The mystery of Robert&#39;s illness and of prot&#39;s true origins lie deep within Robert&#39;s shattered psyche. Now Dr. Brewer must race against the clock to unlock the secrets of Robert&#39;s traumatic past and not only save his patient but maybe humanity.&lt;/p&gt;" />
