  <title>Earth&#39;s Enemy a Satire on the Present from the Future - Barry C. Kent</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Earths Enemy is a fiction about future changes in the way humans live. In this incredible culture humans have evolved a new technology, society and ideology. The changes were gradual and keyed to both a major decrease in population and a seemingly impossible alteration of the economy. 
	The setting is a century and a half from now and takes place largely in the area formerly called the United States.  Due to an unfortunate loss of most books and electronic storage devices much of history no longer exists.  
Jack, a psychologist, has volunteered to explain the new culture to a number of humans from the turn of the 20th century who had undergone cryonics and are now being revived. During these sessions Jack discovers many strange things about the past which the people of his time have forgotten. Likewise, few of the cryons are able to cope with the new culture to which Jack is introducing them.  In one way or another each of them is disappointed by the paucity of technological inventions.  Most are outraged or dismayed by the disappearance of so many things which they thought were an essential part of their way of life. No more newspapers, competitive sports, nursing homes, new music, fossil fuel, air travel, space programs, banks, courtrooms, prisons, money, multitudes of religions and only one language are generally unacceptable or incomprehensible to the cryons. All of them seem pleased to learn that there is no more war, crime, poverty, bigotry, overpopulation, or environmental pollution. However, when they discover the ridiculous changes in economy which have made the new way of life possible most of the cryons are willing to fight for a return to their old way of life." />
