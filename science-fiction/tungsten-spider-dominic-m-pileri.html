  <title>Tungsten Spider - Dominic M Pileri</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Wars are not fought between good and bad people; they are fought by soldiers. 
The Axi have invaded Col. Without a fleet, they have managed to land an entire legion on the Valen world and begin sweeping over its deserts in an unstoppable blitzkrieg. Hellick Primus is a squad leader in Driven Company of the 173rd Legion. He has a wife and two children, but today, his ten troopers are his only family. Veterans of two campaigns, the troopers of D Co soon discover that Col is host to the worst violence of their careers. Despite their superior technology and military discipline, Hellick struggles against micromanaging leadership, Col&#39;s hostile climate, and a crafty enemy to bring each member of his &quot;family&quot; home alive. 
Staff Sergeant Ramsey is 1st Platoon&#39;s sergeant for Bravo Company, 22nd Infantry Battalion. The Col Defense Guard suffers from a peace time mentality, where soldiers&#39; feelings and welfare are placed over training. Ramsey&#39;s platoon is a wreck of poor soldiers guided by weak leaders and equipped with outdated hardware. Slaughter ensues. The weight of survival falls on the shoulders of a few professionals, who find themselves locked in conflict, while their friends are murdered around them. In war there are no underdogs; there are only survivors and fodder.
In war, there are no heroes; there are only the living and the dead. 
War is not fair. 
War is hell. 
Which side will you choose?" />
