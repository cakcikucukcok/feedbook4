  <title>All the Way Home - Mr Tom Melly</title>
      <meta name="description" content="After a terrible accident at CERN, Louie Gage, a 14-year-old boy from the present day, finds himself stranded in another galaxy an unknown distance from Earth.  At first, stuck on an apparently deserted planet, just staying alive seems both impossible as well as an all-consuming task, but, through luck and perseverance, he&#39;s able to begin his efforts to find his way back home.  In his quest, he&#39;s both helped and hindered by an unusual assortment of aliens and machines - but finding his home won&#39;t be easy in a universe of over two hundred and fifty billion galaxies. And just who is trying to kill him and why? And just how, exactly, do you travel faster than light?  &quot;All the Way Home&quot; is a full-length sf novel for ages 14 upwards." />
