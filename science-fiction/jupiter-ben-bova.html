  <title>Jupiter - Ben Bova</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Grant Archer only wanted to study astrophysics. But the forces of the &quot;New Morality,&quot; the coalition of censorious do-gooders who run 21st-century America, have other plans for him. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;To his distress, Grant is torn from his young bride and sent to a research station in orbit around Jupiter, to spy on the scientists who work there. Their work may lead to the discovery of higher life forms in the Jovian system-with implications the New Morality doesn&#39;t like at all.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;What Grant&#39;s would-be controllers don&#39;t know is that his loyalty to science may be greater than his desire for a quiet life. But that loyalty will be tested in a mission as dangerous as any ever undertaken-a mission to the middle reaches of Jupiter&#39;s endless atmosphere, a place where hydrogen flows as a liquid, and cyclones larger than planets rage for centuries at a time.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;What lurks there is more than anyone has counted on...and stranger than anyone could possibly have imagined.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;At the Publisher&#39;s request, this title is being sold without Digital Rights Management Software (DRM) applied.&lt;/p&gt;" />
