  <title>The Psychology of Time Travel - Kate Mascarenhas</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;&lt;b&gt;Perfect for fans of Naomi Alderman&#39;s &lt;i&gt;The Power&lt;/i&gt; and Margot Lee Shetterly’s &lt;i&gt;Hidden Figures&lt;/i&gt; comes &lt;i&gt;The Psychology of Time Travel&lt;/i&gt;, a mind-bending, time-travel murder mystery.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;In 1967, four female scientists worked together to build the world’s first time machine. But just as they are about to debut their creation, one of them suffers a breakdown, putting the whole project—and future of time travel—in jeopardy. To protect their invention, one member is exiled from the team—erasing her contributions from history.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Fifty years later, time travel is a big business. Twenty-something Ruby Rebello knows her beloved grandmother, Granny Bee, was one of the pioneers, though no one will tell her more. But when Bee receives a mysterious newspaper clipping from the future reporting the murder of an unidentified woman, Ruby becomes obsessed: could it be Bee? Who would want her dead? And most importantly of all: can her murder be stopped?&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Traversing the decades and told from alternating perspectives, &lt;i&gt;The Psychology of Time Travel&lt;/i&gt; unites speculative fiction with a clever mystery, introducing a fabulous new voice in fiction.&lt;/div&gt;" />
