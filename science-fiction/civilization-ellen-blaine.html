  <title>Civilization - Ellen Blaine</title>
      <meta name="description" content="A plague has tragically killed most of the female population on planet Salvaren. It is the Season of Madness, which is a time when the males have a biological need to join with females. Facing potential extinction, Salvaren has agreed to exchange rare minerals for females from Earth. 
  Nori is unaware that she was part of the trade agreement when her ship crash lands onto the planet. She soon learns that she is in danger and begins to run for her life. She literally bumps into Runner of the Civilized Special Forces whose only mission is to get her safely to Protected City. 
  Runner will do his duty though it is a survival of the fittest and he is just one against many. He is not immune to the Madness as it is a fight to the death and a race against time to reach Protected City." />
