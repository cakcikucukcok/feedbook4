  <title>Laddertop Books 1 - 2 - Orson Scott Card, Emily Janice Card, Honoel</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;From Orson Scott Card, the bestselling author of &lt;i&gt;Ender&#39;s Game, &lt;/i&gt;and his daughter Emily Janice Card, comes a 384-page omnibus edition containing the first two books of an all-ages manga series!&lt;/b&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Out of deep space, a mysterious alien race known as &quot;The Givers&quot; came to Earth. They gave the human race the greatest technology ever seen--four giant towers known as Ladders that rose 36,000 miles into space. Each tower culminated in a space station that harnessed the energy of the Sun to power the entire planet. As suddenly as the Givers arrived, they vanished, leaving the human race with one solemn instruction: maintain and preserve the Ladders at all costs. Due to the unique alien construction of the Laddertop space stations, however, only a skilled crew of children could perform the maintenance necessary to keep the stations running.&lt;br&gt;Twenty-five years later, back on Earth, competition is fierce to enter Laddertop Academy. Robbi and Azure, two eleven-year-old girls who are best friends, are among those vying for a spot at the prestigious academy. While one is rejected, the other takes off into space for the adventure of a lifetime. Yet soon, their destinies will collide, as they must decipher an alien message and solve an ancient mystery that could either save the Earth from invasion...or trigger its imminent destruction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the Publisher&#39;s request, this title is being sold without Digital Rights Management Software (DRM) applied.&lt;/p&gt;" />
