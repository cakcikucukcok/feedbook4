  <title>The Hosts - Pedro Pujante</title>
      <meta name="description" content="It is a science fiction and fantasy novel, with lots of humor, irony and touches of nonsense.&lt;br/&gt;
A somewhat odd and mediocre writer is surprised to receive an invitation to a &#39;Congress on Secret Literature&#39;, that will take place in a small and remote village in Extremadura, called Higueras. It is all wrapped in a strange mystery, and the information he receives on the subject is scarce and rather confusing. But since he has nothing better to do but get bored, he decides to participate in it.&lt;br/&gt;
The picturesque and peaceful village of Higueras - after a strange journey of which little remembers - is exceptionally empty, fictitious and spectral. Only three other writers - Rocío, Román and Raúl - have attended this phantom and&#39;secret&#39; symposium. There, they are greeted by a strange character named Doctor Faustino.&lt;br/&gt;
But the literary symposium will soon reveal itself as a farce and an excuse to keep them in the strange place. On what grounds? Are they really where they think they are? Do they live in the present or have they been moved to a remote, post-apocalyptic future? Is Higueras a village in Extremadura or a huge fiction? Is Faustino who he says he is? What are those strange noises? Why did you try to clone the illustrious writer Francisco Umbral?&lt;br/&gt;
This novel is a journey back in time - we don&#39;t quite know when - in which a small town could be inhabited by clones with powers, grotesque TV presenters and creepy monsters.&lt;br/&gt;" />
