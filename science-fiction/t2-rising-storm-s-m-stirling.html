  <title>T2: Rising Storm - S.m. Stirling</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Following the critically praised &lt;em&gt;T2: Infiltrator, T2: Rising Storm&lt;/em&gt; continues the bestselling Terminator adventures, reaching new heights of action, drama, and suspense.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hunted for years, Sarah and John Connor have waged a grave battle to save humanity from destruction. They and they alone can keep the apocalyptic Judgment Day&amp;#8212;the day when sentient machines move to destroy their human creators&amp;#8212;from occurring. Aided by Dieter von Rossbach, an ex-counterterrorism operative who will eventually be used as the physical model for the T-101 Terminator units, the Connors have sabotaged the Cyberdyne research facility and stopped a deadly I-950 Infiltrator unit from completing her mission.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the war is far from over, and now the heroes have been separated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Severely injured&amp;#8212;both mentally and physically&amp;#8212;and recuperating under military surveillance, Sarah Connor must face her deepest fears...alone. Meanwhile, von Rossbach, hunted by both the CIA and his former allies, begins a delicate mission to recruit supporters and arms support for the coming battle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Aided by a beautiful and brilliant MIT student, John Connor starts a desperate campaign across the United States and Central America to prepare an unsuspecting human race for the dark times ahead. For the original I-950 Infiltrator unit left a contingency plan&amp;#8212;and, unbeknownst to our heroes, more Infiltrators have initiated their own clandestine operations, including the hunt to terminate the Connors. And this time, despite all their efforts, the brave heroes may not be able to stop the future war between human and machine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cyberdyne Corporation is not the only one with plans for the computer network, and hidden far away in a top secret military base, a fledgling Skynet takes its first steps toward sentience...and toward the rise of the machines and the termination of all human life.&lt;/p&gt;" />
