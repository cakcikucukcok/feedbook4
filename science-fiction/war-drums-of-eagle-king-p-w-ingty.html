  <title>War Drums of Eagle King - P.W.Ingty</title>
      <meta name="description" content="WAR DRUMS OF EAGLE KING, is a story of Koch warrior Sukladhvaj, brother of Nar Narayan ruler of the Koch Kingdom during the 16th century. He was Commander-in-Chief of the Koch army and under his leadership the Koch troops achieved devastating victories over the Ahoms, the Kacharies, the Twipra and others as a result of the brilliant strategy and swift hitting tactics used by Sukladhvaj. His deadly tactics and swift victories over his opponents earn him the nickname of Chilarai which means eagle king and his success is partly attributed to the mysterious power of an eagle that he is said to be capable of invoking on rare occasions. During his campaigns Chilarai meets Sankardev, a great religious and cultural reformer and the experience has such an effect on Chilarai that a subtle change takes place in his perception of life and society. He also meets and later on weds the lovely and devoted Kamala. The eagle king is snared during his expedition to Gauda, in a trap laid by the clever Kalapahar, a General of Gauda and then held as a prisoner in the city of Gaur. However, Chilarai charms his way into a position of favor with Sultan Suleiman and his family and as a result he is finally released from captivity. Soon after his release the war drums start rolling out their ominous beat once again." />
