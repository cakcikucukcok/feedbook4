      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;In the far off future, the worlds natural resources have run dry, and we have been forced to rely on the moon for critical mining operations. Oreheavy asteroids from the asteroid belt are brought to the moon, where a number of companies struggle to stay on top, including the United American Republic, European Union, and Africas Transvaal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each company has its own armed guards who protect mining operations on site. Jim Hawkins has just enlisted with the UAR, and now its time for him to head to space with a team of his fellow soldiers. Hawkins is green; hes never seen actual combat. He may soon learn more than he ever imagined.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Someone is out to sabotage UARs operations. As a Space Marine, Hawkins knows its his job to stop them, but can he discover the culprit before its too late? One of their trusted allies could be behind the attack, and Hawkins will need to grow up fast to sort this mess out.&lt;/p&gt;" />
