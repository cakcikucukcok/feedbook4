  <title>Dia - Henrik Moller</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Dia is a witch, a descendant of the ancient gods, and her world is one of endless cycles of murder and revenge and murder and revenge that had their origins in the dawn of history--the latest victims of those ancient feuds were her parents.  And Dia&#39;s boyfriend, Jason... Suddenly, his world is one of endless impossibilities.  His girlfriend is a witch, a girl out of myth and legend who in ancient times would have been called a goddess.  A girl who, when she&#39;s startled, small earthquakes happen. But together Dia and Jason try to find out why her parents were killed and, together, have to try to keep her alive.  Dia is scared, not only for her own life, but of the near certainty that any effort to kill her would also kill Jason--he has no defenses at all against the overwhelming violence of which witches were capable.  For his part, Jason is perfectly willing to die for Dia, and he knows it&#39;s likely that he will, but nothing&#39;s going to stop him from trying to help her survive." />
