  <title>The Aliens within - Ben Bova</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Multi-Hugo Award-winning author Ben Bova continues the story of Earth&#39;s first extraterrestrial contact with &lt;i&gt;Voyagers II: The Alien Within&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eighteen years ago, astronaut Keith Stoner had been the American member of a joint U.S.-Soviet mission to capture an alien ship that had entered the solar system. It was the greatest adventure in the history of Earth--but disaster struck when a bomb placed on the Soviet craft forced its recall. Stoner refused to return to Earth, staying behind in the strange ship alone where he fell into suspended animation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jo Camerata, the ambitious young student who fell in love with Stoner, is now head of Vanguard Industries. Jo&#39;s dogged determination has forced the recovery of the alien ship, and now her company is in control of the vast new technology--and in control of Keith Stoner. What Camerata doesn&#39;t know, however, is that when Stoner wakes, someone else awakens, too. The alien presence in Stoner&#39;s mind that has kept him alive all these years is now free, and intends to explore the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And it will let nothing stand in its way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the Publisher&#39;s request, this title is being sold without Digital Rights Management Software (DRM) applied.&lt;/p&gt;" />
