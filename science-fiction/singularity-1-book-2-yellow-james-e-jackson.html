  <title>Singularity 1 Book 2  Yellow - James E. Jackson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;A group of nine women met in the darkness, ignoring the snow. A lone wulf watched them, but did not approach them. Wulves had never bothered Muses. They were sentient, intelligent and could communicate telepathically. They roamed in packs, of up to a few dozen, but widely spread. Another woman approached, walking close to the wulf, who remained docile to the point that she could pat him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;*****&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then its agreed. The last five have been disappointments, so Im happy to vote with the majority and give this one another go. He got close last time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I agree, too. I think we put too much weight on his appearance. Hes not as ugly as all that when you get to know him. You should handle this one Rika. Welcome to the sisterhood, by the way, we love getting new recruits. Because its such a big one, I think we should all help you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The leader stood, and looked to the sky. She pointed far off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Look, the others are coming now. Its time to move, Rika. Good luck darling. Try to make a good impression with him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The women embraced and dispersed their separate ways.&lt;/p&gt;" />
