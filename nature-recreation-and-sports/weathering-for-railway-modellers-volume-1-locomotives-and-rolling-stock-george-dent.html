  <title>Weathering for Railway Modellers: Volume 1 - Locomotives and Rolling Stock - George Dent</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Once seen as a niche practice, the craft of weathering has now become firmly rooted in the railway modelling mainstream.  Not simply a means of rendering models in layers of dirty paint, weathering involves a myriad of techniques aimed at improving realism, including distinctive surface textures, highlights and shading, burnishing and peeling paint finishes.  The weathering process brings out the best in a model, making moulded relief or a lustrous livery really stand out.  As well as replicating the real world more closely, weathering also helps a model to look at home within a scenic setting. Aimed at modellers of all abilities and eras, this book is an essential guide to creating the most realistic locomotives and rolling stock in any scale. It includes: a guide to tools, paints, washes, dry pigments and other innovative media; the correct techniques for model preparation; a wide range of techniques for wagons, carriages, locomotives and multiple units in any scale; how to replicate authentic surface textures and effects, from polished surfaces to corroded metal and worn timber; how to bring models to life with faded paintwork, peeling and chipped finishes and subtle highlights and shading; the secret to successful airbrushing.  This book will be of great interest to railway modellers of varying abilities, particularly those interested in rolling stock and locomotives, and is fully illustrated with 660 colour photographs." />
