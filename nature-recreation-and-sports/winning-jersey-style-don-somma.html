  <title>Winning Jersey Style - Don Somma</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;When you grow up in a predominantly Italian neighborhood surrounded by other ethnic communities and small towns in Central New Jersey, you develop a love of family, sports, and the strong desire to compete. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jump on the bus with me, traveling north and south on the turnpike and parkway, east and west on Routes 22 and 278, having fun playing and coaching high school football on Friday nights and Saturday afternoons for over forty years. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everyone had to buy in to be successful. A real look in the eye commitment was needed. On this ride you get to share some great stories about these experiences that happened in eight different high school districts in Union, Essex, Middlesex,
Somerset, Ocean and Hunterdon counties. These teams played for six State Sectional Championships in football, winning four, and wrestled for three State Sectional Championships, winning all three. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you read about these programs, you will understand what the concept of Winning Jersey Style is all about, both on the field and off.&lt;/p&gt;" />
