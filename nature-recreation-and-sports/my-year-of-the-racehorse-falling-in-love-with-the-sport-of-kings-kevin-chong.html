  <title>My Year of the Racehorse: Falling in Love with the Sport of Kings - Kevin Chong</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;Kevin Chong has grand plans. He draws up a to-do list of major milestones that will give him the life he always wanted&amp;#151;and the life that will inspire awe and envy in his friends. Things like settling down and starting a family; learning a foreign language; getting a tattoo. But these grand plans go out the window when Chong makes an unconventional decision: he&#39;s going to buy a racehorse. Not the whole thing&amp;#151;he&#39;ll become part&amp;#151;owner of the horse. Just don&#39;t ask him which part.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Thus Chong meets Blackie, the racehorse that will win his heart, even if she doesn&#39;t always win on the track. He meets Randi, the cantankerous and foul-mouthed horse trainer with a heart of gold. He meets an assorted array of characters who work, live and drink at the track&amp;#151;and, one by one, the items on his to-do list are crossed out and replaced with horse-related ambitions. His goals are a bit more humble (cussing like a track worker replaces learning a foreign language), but his life has gained new meaning.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;The story is infused with the noise, excitement and faded glamour of the horse-racing world. It is strewn with fascinating tidbits about the history and tradition of this&lt;/div&gt;" />
