  <title>The Gloves - Robert Anasi</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;A gritty, spirited inside look at the world of amateur boxing today&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Golden Gloves tournament is center stage in amateur boxing-a single-elimination contest in which young hopefuls square off in steamy gyms with the boxing elite looking on. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Robert Anasi took up boxing in his twenties to keep in shape, attract women, and sharpen his knuckles for the odd bar fight. He thought of entering &quot;the Gloves,&quot; but put it off. Finally, at age thirty-two-his last year of eligibility-he vowed to fight, although he was an old man in a sport of teenagers and a light man who had to be even lighter (125 pounds) to fight others his size.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So begins Anasi&#39;s obsessive preparation for the Golden Gloves. He finds Milton, a wily and abusive trainer, and joins Milton&#39;s &quot;Supreme Team&quot;: a black teenager who used to deal guns in Harlem, a bus driver with five kids, a hard-hitting woman champion who becomes his sparring partner. Meanwhile, he observes the changing world of amateur boxing, in which investment bankers spar with ex-convicts and everyone dreads a fatal blow to the head. With the Supreme Team, he goes to the tournament, whose outcome, it seems, is rigged, like so much in boxing life today. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Robert Anasi tells his story not as a journalist on assignment but as a man in the midst of one of the great adventures of his life. &lt;i&gt;The Gloves&lt;/i&gt;, his first book, has the feel of a contemporary classic.&lt;/p&gt;" />
