  <title>It Chooses You - Miranda July</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;In the summer of 2009, Miranda July was struggling to finish writing the screenplay for her much-anticipated second film. During her increasingly long lunch breaks, she began to obsessively read the &lt;I&gt;PennySaver&lt;/I&gt;, the iconic classifieds booklet that reached everywhere and seemed to come from nowhere. Who was the person selling the &amp;#147;Large leather Jacket, $10&amp;#8221;? It seemed important to find out&amp;#151;or at least it was a great distraction from the screenplay.&lt;br&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Accompanied by photographer Brigitte Sire, July crisscrossed Los Angeles to meet a random selection of &lt;I&gt;PennySaver&lt;/I&gt; sellers, glimpsing thirteen surprisingly moving and profoundly specific realities, along the way shaping her film, and herself, in unexpected ways.&lt;br&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Elegantly blending narrative, interviews, and photographs with July&amp;#8217;s off-kilter honesty and deadpan humor, this is a story of procrastination and inspiration, isolation and connection, and grabbing hold of the invisible world.&lt;/div&gt;" />
