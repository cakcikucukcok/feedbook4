  <title>Life Is a Road Trip - Nikki Greene</title>
      <meta name="description" content="When Darren, Nikki and Larry sat around talking about selling everything, quitting their jobs and hitting the road  deep down it was just something fun to talk about, not real.  But when life gave them the opportunity to have such an adventure, they decided to go for it.  Winnie, their RV, was their new addition to the family.
&lt;br&gt;
Nikki and Darren had spent the last eight years being married and building a normal life including owning a mortgage or two, climbing the corporate ladder and preparing their life for a family.  All but the last thing happened so they decided to talk about all the things they could do if they didnt have kids  including travel.  It was time to stop talking and starting doing.
&lt;br&gt;
After 37 states, numerous breakdowns, Elvis sightings, the last Mardi gras before Hurricane Katrina, Appalachian Trail crossings and many other humorous encounters, they end up nearly a year later where they started with a new business and another addition to the family.  The next adventure will be even greater than the last!" />
