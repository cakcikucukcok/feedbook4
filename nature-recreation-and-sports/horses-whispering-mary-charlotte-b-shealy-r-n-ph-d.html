  <title>Horses Whispering: - Mary-Charlotte B. Shealy R.N. Ph.D.</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Horses Whispering&lt;/i&gt; emphasizes the unique bond between horses and people, suggesting that every hair on the horse is a biofeedback signal that the horse is responding to connectedness with the rider.  For adults interested in beginning horseback riding or returning to riding after a period of time, often due to a traumatic experience with a horse, the author provides detailed examples of the wide range of experiences which are useful to all equestrian activities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding the power of the horse/rider partnership is a metaphor for the gestalt of teaching and learning.&lt;br&gt;
Abigail B. Wiebenson, Director Emerita, Lowell School,Washington, DC&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indeed, learning to receive the unspoken messages from people and horses is crucial for all successful relationships. Just as human body language is often more important than speech, intuitive awareness of this more subtle information is essential for all aspects of life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a call for your success-centered life, whatever your interests.  Once you learn the whispered messages between individuals, you will overcome fears about your interactions with other people and animals.&lt;/p&gt;" />
