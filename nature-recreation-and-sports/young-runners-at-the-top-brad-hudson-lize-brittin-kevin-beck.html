      <meta name="description" content="&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;In today&amp;rsquo;s hyper-competitive world, young athletes are often pushed to compete and pressured to succeed to the point of burnout.

But in order to train and compete intelligently&amp;mdash;to become better runners yet avoid injuries or academic and social missteps&amp;mdash;they need guidance.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-style:italic;&quot;&gt;Young Runners at the Top: A Training, Racing, and Lifestyle Guide for Competitors and Coaches &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;provides helpful instructions and suggestions for runners of all abilities.
