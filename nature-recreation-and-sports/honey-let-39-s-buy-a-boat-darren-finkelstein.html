  <title>Honey, let&#39;s buy a BOAT! - Darren Finkelstein</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Revised Edition published 2014.  Right now there are over 1.6 million people who love boating on the rivers, lakes and oceans around Australia. They must be onto something.   So what&#39;s stopping you from getting in on this lifestyle? Buying a boat can be daunting and depending on whom you talk to, you will get all kinds of advice. Some of it&#39;s great but much of it can be lousy.   At last there is one book that answers every question you could have about buying a power boat in Australia. Darren Finkelstein has been buying, selling and simply messing around with boats for over 30 years and that is exactly what prompted him to write &quot;Honey, let&#39;s buy a BOAT! &quot;.   This book answers all of your questions and outlines the process to make buying (and selling) a recreational power boat within reach of everyone. Make no mistake, this book aims to convince you that boats and boat ownership, is truly awesome and as Darren says &quot;life&#39;s better with a boat&quot;.  &quot;Knowing your options and all of the facts will get you on the water, enjoying quality time with family and friends. And that will build a healthy and active boating community. Boating in Australia has always been an attractive outdoor activity that is both healthy for the mind and the body. Fundamentally, Australia is an island - boating just makes sense!&quot;  Andy Warner, President - Boating Industry Association of Victoria  &quot;I have never met anyone with the level of knowledge about buying boats as Darren. He is a straight shooter with a total commitment to get people on the water, living the great Australian lifestyle. This book is a must read for new and experienced boaties alike.&quot;  Andrew Griffiths, Bestselling Author and Boat Lover  &quot;I&#39;ve bought and sold several boats from Darren at St Kilda Boat Sales for many of years now and actively recommend him to many of my friends. He sure knows what he is doing. When it comes to power boats, Darren is my MAN.&quot; Andrew Fox (LINFOX) www.letsbuyaboat.com.au" />
