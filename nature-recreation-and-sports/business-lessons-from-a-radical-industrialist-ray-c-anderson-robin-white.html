  <title>Business Lessons from a Radical Industrialist - Ray C. Anderson, Robin White</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;In 1994, Interface founder and chairman Ray Anderson set an audacious goal for his commercial carpet company: to take nothing&lt;i&gt;from&lt;/i&gt; the earth that can&#39;t be replaced &lt;i&gt;by&lt;/i&gt; the earth. Now, Anderson leads the way forward and challenges all of industry to share that goal. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Interface story is a compelling one: in 1994, making carpets was a toxic, petroleum-based process, releasing immense amounts of air and water pollution and creating tons of waste. Fifteen years after Anderson&#39;s call for change, Interface has: &lt;br&gt;--cut greenhouse gas emissions by 82%--cut fossil fuel consumption by 60%--cut waste by 66%--cut water use by 75%--invented and patented new machines, materials, and manufacturing processes--increased sales by 66%, doubled earnings, and raised profit margins &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With practical ideas and measurable outcomes that every business can use, Anderson shows that profit and sustainability are not mutually exclusive; businesses can improve their bottom lines and do right by the earth. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ray Anderson is featured in the film, &lt;i&gt;So Right, So Smart&lt;/i&gt;, which takes a behind-the-scenes look at how his leadership transformed Interface into a company with a sustainable business practices that made it more profitable than it was before.&lt;/p&gt;" />
