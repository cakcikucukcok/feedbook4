Her collection of essays, &lt;em&gt;Wedded to the Land&lt;/em&gt;, peels back the skin of her blueberry farm with the precision and eloquence of a Wendell Berry, Edward Abbey, and other agrarian essayists who make us pine for the lost heart of the country.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span&gt;George Getschow, writer-in-residence, The Mayborn Graduate Institute of Journalism, former editor for the &lt;em&gt;Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span&gt;John thought he was building a garage when he erected a timber-frame building only a stones throw from the house we built on the back of our farm. While washing the dishes, I mulled over how pleasant it would be to look out our kitchen window and watch goats lounge in a paddock. If goats lived in the new shed, the walk wouldnt be far when milking in the winter or during kidding season.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span&gt;Once outside, I scanned the sixteen-by-twenty-foot framework. You know, a couple of goats would fit nicely in here. Theres room for two stalls. Johns hammer paused. I continued. The aspens and honeysuckle on the north would shelter an outdoor pen. I tied on a nail apron and picked up a hammer.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />
