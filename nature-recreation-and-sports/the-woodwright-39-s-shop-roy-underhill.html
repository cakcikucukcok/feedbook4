  <title>The Woodwright&#39;s Shop - Roy Underhill</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Roy Underhill brings to woodworking the intimate relationship with wood that craftsmen enjoyed in the days before power tools. Combining historical background, folklore, alternative technololgy, and humor, he provides both a source of general information and a detailed introduction to traditional woodworking. Beginning with a guide to trees and tools, &lt;i&gt;The Woodwright&#39;s Shop&lt;/i&gt; includes chapters on gluts and mauls, shaving horses, rakes, chairs, weaving wood, hay forks, dough bowls, lathes, blacksmithing, dovetails, panel-frame construction, log houses, and timber-frame construction. More than 330 photographs illustrate the text.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;!--copy for restock:&lt;br/&gt;For more than twenty-five years, Roy Underhill has taught the techniques of traditional hand-tool woodworking. In five books and on his popular, long-running PBS series, The Woodwright&#39;s Shop, America&#39;s leading authority on old-time woodcraft has inspired millions to take up chisel and plane. Designed for both woodworking novices and for more seasoned woodworkers looking for enjoyable projects, the books feature step-by-step instructions, complete with easy-to-follow photographs and measured drawings. &lt;br/&gt;Roy Underhill is the former master housewright at Colonial Williamsburg. He created The Woodwright&#39;s Shop, one of the first television programs devoted to woodworking, in 1979. The series is produced by the University of North Carolina Center for Public Television and has aired nationally since 1981. Roy is a graduate of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and holds a master&#39;s degree from Duke University.

Roy also explores building barns, boats, and even colonial fortresses.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Woodwright&#39;s Eclectic Workshop&lt;br/&gt;Popular projects include the Adirondack chair, tavern table, folding ladder, rocking horse, lathe, and kayak, all illustrated with photographs and measured drawings.    &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Woodwright&#39;s Apprentice&lt;br/&gt;Twenty Favorite Projects from The Woodwright&#39;s Shop&lt;br/&gt;Begins with directions for building a workbench, then builds new skills--from frame construction to dovetailing, turning, steam-bending, and carving--with each successive project.&lt;br/&gt;--&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;" />
