  <title>3-Minute Horsemanship: 60 Amazingly Achievable Lessons to Improve Your Horse When Time Is Short - Vanessa Bee</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;A new book especially written for the time-starved 21st-century horse owner! Do you day after day make a promise to train yourself and your horse to be better at something, but when you get to the barn there just doesn&amp;#8217;t seem to be enough time? Don&amp;#8217;t worry, what really matters is the quality of the training you do manage to fit in. It really is possible to carry out good quality, progressive training with a horse in only three minutes a day. Educator and horse trainer Vanessa Bee&amp;#8217;s &amp;#147;light bulb moment&amp;#8221; was when she realized that if a training session had a realistic goal, every horse achieved the goal in under three minutes. This led her to create techniques appropriate for use in brief digestible lessons that ultimately produce significant gains in short sessions. This refreshing new method offers 35 ground exercises, 24 ridden exercises, and 25 &amp;#147;real world&amp;#8221; exercises that will get you out and about with a safe, sane, well-trained horse.&lt;/div&gt;" />
