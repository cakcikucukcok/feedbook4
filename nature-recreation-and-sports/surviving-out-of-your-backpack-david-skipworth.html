  <title>Surviving Out of Your Backpack - David Skipworth</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This book helps to prepare your backpack with essentials that will give you the advantage needed to survive. It will show you how to use these important essentials in time of need. This book explains different animals for food, cooking and preservation. It explains hunting skills, trapping, skinning and field dressing game meat for the nutrition needed to survive. It explains how to build shelters, fires and how to beat the elements of harsh weather. This book explains how to dress and clean game, how to cut up the game meat and how to preserve the meat for long term usage. This book explains how to tan hides to be used for clothing and shelters. This book talks about animals and what to look for to prevent sickness or disease. It shows tracks of important animals and what they look like for tracking. This book discuses animals from the southern part of North America to Canada and Alaska.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Being a simple guide for a &amp;quot;Bug out Bag&amp;quot; is not the purpose of this book. However, having such a bag is of great importance when talking about survival for you and your family. This book goes much farther than helping you to transform a simple backpack into a life saving instrument of necessity. &amp;quot;Surviving out of your Backpack&amp;quot; is a survival guide that will sustain you and your family&amp;#39;s life when all else fails.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;Surviving out of your Backpack&amp;quot; is more than just a quick fix for survival; it is for sustaining life as long as you need it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This book was intentionally written to be short and compact for the purpose of carrying in your backpack without causing a lot of weight. This book is like a stick of dynamite; it&amp;#39;s small but packs a lot of power. The main focus of this book is to SURVIVE! It is a MUST HAVE BOOK!" />
