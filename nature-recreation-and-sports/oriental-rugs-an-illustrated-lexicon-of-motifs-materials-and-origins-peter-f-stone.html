  <title>Oriental Rugs: An Illustrated Lexicon of Motifs, Materials, and Origins - Peter F. Stone</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;&lt;B&gt;This monumental reference work&amp;#8212;long awaited by collectors and scholars&amp;#8212;fills an important gap in the available literature on oriental rugs.&lt;/B&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt; Lavishly illustrated with over 1000 photographs and drawings, it offers clear and precise definitions for the rug and textile terms in use across a broad swath of the globe&amp;#8212;from Morocco to Turkey, Persia, the Caucasus region, Central Asia, Afghanistan, Pakistan, India and China. Covering priceless museum-quality rug traditions as well as modern centers of production, &lt;I&gt;Oriental Rugs: An Illustrated Lexicon of Motifs, Materials, and Origins&lt;/I&gt; draws on classical scholarship as well as current terminology in use among producers and traders in these areas today. It focuses primarily on the rich hand-knotting and hand-weaving traditions of the Near East and Central Asia, but also includes some examples of Scandinavian and Native American weavings.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Oriental rugs are receiving ever-increasing attention and recognition in the field of art history. Tribal weavings especially have become a focus for new research, and Oriental Rugs provides a new understanding of many distinctive traditions that were previously understudied, such as the weavings of southwest Persia, Baluchistan and Kurdistan. This concise oriental rug reference book is a must-have for scholars and anyone serious about collecting rugs.&lt;/div&gt;" />
