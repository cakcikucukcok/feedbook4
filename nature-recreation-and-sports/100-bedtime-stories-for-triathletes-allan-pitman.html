  <title>100 Bedtime Stories for Triathletes - Allan Pitman</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;I f youre a tired athlete looking for inspiration, look no further than this collection of short stories written by Alan Pitman.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;No matter what sport youre passionate about, youll find insights that will help you hone your focus and boost performance. Youll also be entertained by his many adventures.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Although hes coached more than three hundred Ironman finishers over twenty five years, Pitman shares that at times, even hes found it hard to train. Thats why he recommends having a training partner, as its easier to let yourself down than one of your friends waiting out in the cold on a dark morning.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;As you read Pitmans stories, youll be challenged to never settle for anything other than excellence, to set lofty goals, and keep going when you want to give up. Youll also learn how to prevent injuries, take calculated risks, build self-esteem, embrace change, and learn from failure.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Get motivated and get moving with &lt;i&gt;100 Bedtime Stories for Triathletes&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;i&gt;I am both pleased and honoured to be able to endorse Allans book. Allan is an amazing athlete. Triathlete, Ironman multiple finisher of forty three races, an Ironman in Australia Legend and finisher of 17 Ironman World Championship races including four podium appearance.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;i&gt;As a renowned and hugely respected Ironman Triathlon coach of many years standing his words of wisdom on every page are both profound and inspirational and a must read for all athletes especially Ironman Triathlon aspirants as well as past and continuing competitors.&lt;/i&gt;  Ken Baggs, OAM&lt;/P&gt;" />
