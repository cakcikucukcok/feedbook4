  <title>Johnny’S Family Goes Camping - Johnny Mullens, Susan Shorter</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Johnnys family looked forward to their annual camping trip to Bull Creek Campground.  The week-long camping trip has been planned for months because of when Johnnys dad could take his vacation from work.  The campground has pretty natural scenery but also has a history of flooding.  The family camping trip could also be the same time as a flood.
Johnny, his sister Sandy and his parents prepare in case of a flood.  When the flood happens, because of their planning they are able to make it safely out of the campground and help others.
When someone needs to be rescued in a flood or other natural disaster, their rescuer is in danger trying to rescue them.  This story provides some safety ideas so that a family may be able to help themselves and others before the flood happens.  The best way to avoid being a flood victim is to have a plan before the flood." />
