In &lt;em&gt;Hockey Dad&lt;/em&gt;, McKenzie describes firsthand the joys and heartbreak of raising two sons, with entirely diverging athletic futures. He details their separate paths, describing Michael, a 22-year-old playing NCAA hockey on scholarship, and Shawn, now 19, whose competitive minor hockey life was cut short at age 14 because of multiple concussions. Their deeply personal stories, and the trials and tribulations of a father creating futures for them, offer readers a compelling look into the world and culture of minor hockey.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Includes funny anecdotes, debates on numerous hockey issues, and personal reflections on the game and its culture&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With an unwavering look at his own strengths and weaknesses, as well as the entire system of minor hockey in Canada, &lt;em&gt;Hockey Dad&lt;/em&gt; is an honest, irreverent and sometimes moving look at a sporting culture that is not so much a recreation as it is a way of life.&lt;/p&gt;" />
