  <title>Why Is Satan Against Christians? - Paul Antwi</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This book has been written to help Christians become more aware of how the 
devil takes advantage of several conditions of their lives. The Holy Spirit led the 
author to unveil various aspects of life which believers and unbelievers must 
know. It EXPOSES the identities of  Satan and his accomplices, as well as their 
activities; and provides revelations by which Christians will be able to overcome 
them. It also highlights a number of things that Christians must be conscious 
of, that they may stand firm less they fall. Certain topics of the Christian life; such 
as fellowship with God, marriage, how God deals with Christians, etc., are all 
treated in it. 
This book, above all, challenges unbeliever to give his/her life to 
Christ; for salvation comes only through Jesus Christ. And to those who already believe, the front-cover image shows some believers seriously running away from Satan. You may be wondering why many believers who firmly hold Bible in hand are yet running away from Satan as he laughs at their ignorance. Read this book in order to end the ignorance by knowing who you are  and the authority given to you, and be able to overcome him.
Indeed, it is A MUST READ for everyone, believers and unbelievers alike. If the 
reader will consider this book seriously, by practicing what is learned from it 
(after obtaining it), he/she will be fully equipped and be able to resist the devil 
in all his endeavors." />
