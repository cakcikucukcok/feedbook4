  <title>Make and Takes for Kids: 50 Crafts Throughout the Year - Marie LeBaron</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;b&gt;50 seasonal projects to make with kids&lt;/b&gt;&lt;p&gt;Highlighting the best of each month of the year, &lt;i&gt;Make and Takes for Kids&lt;/i&gt; offers 50 projects to make with kids, each centered around an upcoming holiday or season. The ideas are unique and simple to produce, and each project is thoughtfully constructed and designed to create an ideal environment and setting for crafting. Each craft requires little preparation, few supplies, and almost everything can be readily found at home or at a local craft supply store. &lt;p&gt;Crafting isn&#39;t just playtime; there&#39;s a purpose to all the gluing, cutting, and coloring. Children are learning hand-eye coordination, fine motor skills, problem solving, math, teamwork, and individual expression. They are exercising creativity and building their imaginations. &lt;i&gt;Make and Takes for Kids&lt;/i&gt; highlights the learning objectives and skills that children will attain as they complete each craft. Parents learn the benefits of spending time to create and craft with their children, and see the growth and creativity that children can experience while crafting.&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;50 projects to make crafts and food with kids, from a Marshmallow Graham Cracker Snowman and Flower Garden Cupcakes to an Egg Carton Octopus and Rainbow Ring Bottle Toss&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Ten activities are included that can be crafted with recycled materials, making the crafts easy to produce as well as budget-friendly&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Projects demonstrate that you don&#39;t have to buy expensive supplies or make elaborate activities to have fun crafting and creating&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you&#39;re a mom, teacher, or caregiver looking to enhance the time and quality spent with young children, &lt;i&gt;Make and Takes For Kids&lt;/i&gt; makes it easy to have fun crafting with kids." />
