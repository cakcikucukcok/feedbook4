  <title>Little Luke Leaves Home - Malinda Kitchin Boren</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Little Luke Leaves Home is a journey about Lukes first year and his life as a five-pound dog that managed to find whatever was needed to survive in his world where everyone was bigger. He was a runt, but did not know it. Lukes loyalty to one family made him choose to leave a home once, but his home changed several more times before he was one year old. Being the smallest in his family, he learned hard, valuable lessons in competing to eat and survive the elements. Although his loyalty was admirable, his curiosity and intelligence got him in trouble with a grey squirrel, and a search for his former family took him into peril on a harsh North Carolina mountain. He made dog friends easily and met another rescued Chihuahua named Momo, who weighed three pounds. Momo had suffered injuries in hurricane Katrina, but Luke liked being his friend because it made Luke the big dog for a change. Lukes adventurous personality and his inquiring mind created the never-dull and never-ending exciting situations of Lukes life. Once he decided he liked his home, his life on a North Carolina mountain blossomed like the grey squirrels and new creatures to him called Chipmunks.&lt;/p&gt;" />
