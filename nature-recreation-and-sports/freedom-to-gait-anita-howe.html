  <title>Freedom to Gait - Anita Howe</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Knowledge is the key to solutions.  Communications are the key to partnership. With these objectives, Anita Howe has given us a road map to understanding the gaited horse; to work in partnership and be gifted with all the natural gaits within them.  
 Part I of Freedom to Gait gives you the knowledge of equine biomechanics as it relates to gait. This fundamental understanding of how your horse carries and uses himself readily shows you what is needed for him to release his natural gaiting abilities. 
 Part II gives you the tools of communication and partnership you&#39;ll need to engage his mind for a willing and eager partner that offers you his gait. 
 Part III combines the knowledge of biomechanics and the tools of communication to provide you with a step by step training plan, to determine where your horse is experiencing difficulty and how you can help him naturally correct and release his carriage, balance and gait.  Anita addresses a variety of the most commonly seen gait problems as well as dedicating a full chapter on developing the canter in your gaited horse. 
 Part IV focuses on the  walking horses and their particular needs of impulsion and balance at gait to help those who wish to develop their horses athletic brilliance and show potential.  Learn how your walking horse can achieve greater athleticism and brilliance at gait, soundly and humanely, using this willing and caring partnership to offer, build and polish his gait without mechanical gimmicks or influences." />
