  <title>Earn ,000 Per Month Playing Online Poker - Ryan Wiseman, Les Vandor, Laura Moisin</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Much like a pilot need not know the pure physics behind his flight, a skilled poker player need not know the pure mathematics behind winning poker play. Too often have poker books taken a purely theoretical approach to poker instruction.
This book is the only poker book available that caters specifically to online sit-n-go (SNG) single-table low-limit Texas Hold&#39;em tournaments. More importantly, it is the only poker book that guides the reader on a progressive path upward through the various limits, with only the information necessary to win with any bankroll or skill level to beat that specific low limit. Presented in a series of steps, the book provides guidelines that help tell the reader when to move up to a higher limit.
SNG&#39;s have very predictable durations (40-60 minutes) so the reader could effectively set aside blocks of time to play. Unlike other games, the book contends that SNG&#39;s have very predictable win/loss rates, can be defeated systematically, and offer an innate system of progression. That is, the various buy-in amounts can be viewed as a climbable ladder that helps gauge success.
As with any gambling, winning is not a sure thing. But this book gives you the tools you need to win." />
