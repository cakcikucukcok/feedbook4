  <title>An Irrational Hatred of Everything - Robert Banks</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;It has been a long fifteen years since cult favourite An Irrational Hatred of Luton took readers on a tortured journey through the world of a committed football supporter.  Author and lifelong Hammer’s fan Robert Banks is back with a fresh dose of perspective on what it means to be a West Ham supporter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When his first book came out the internet was still in nappies and West Ham United’s home was Upton Park. This new volume is born into a very different world, where football fans seek instant gratification via social media – a world where everyone has an opinion and no matter how positive the mood there is always someone who will bring it down.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But football is just a game, after all. It is on the back pages of the newspaper for a reason. It doesn’t really matter in the grand scheme of things. We make it important because of what it means to us – it helps us to forget about what is on the front pages and the more pressing issues in our own lives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This new book of musings, by turns funny and poignant, describes what it means to be a true football fan.&lt;/p&gt;" />
