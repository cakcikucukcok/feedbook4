Word of the embarrassing ass-kicking of a top Navy team by a bunch of Army nobodies got all the way back to Ted Williams, stationed in Hawaii, and soon after, he and his Navy All-Stars Touring Team accompanied by a crew of Seabees arrived on New Guinea and carved a diamond out of that jungle, and a game it was..." />
