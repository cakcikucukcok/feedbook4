  <title>Developing Wicket Keepers - Paul Davidge</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Wicket Keeping is an art and, like any art there is a requirement to spend quality time practising this craft to make the outcome(s) consistent. The lack of time that is allowed for wicket keeping specific coaching in coach education programmes is reflected by the small amount of time that is spent coaching young keepers in junior club sessions. Generally this is not the fault of coaches but highlights the lack of opportunity they are given to develop an understanding about this specialised position. The aim of this book is to give coaches (at club and county age group level) a guide as how to set up and organise basic wicket keeping drills and activities. This resource is not designed to create more work but to be used as a ‘quick and easy’ way to help young wicket keepers develop their games further." />
