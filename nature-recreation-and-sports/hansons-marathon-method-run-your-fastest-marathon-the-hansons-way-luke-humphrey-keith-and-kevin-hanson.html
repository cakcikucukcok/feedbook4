  <title>Hansons Marathon Method: Run Your Fastest Marathon the Hansons Way - Luke Humphrey, Keith and Kevin Hanson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Run your first marathon or your fastest with &lt;em&gt;Hansons Marathon Method&lt;/em&gt;, the revolutionary training program from one of the best running teams in the world, the Hansons-Brooks Distance Project.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In &lt;em&gt;Hansons Marathon Method&lt;/em&gt;, the coaches of the Hansons-Brooks Distance Project reveal their innovative marathon training program that has helped thousands of runners become true marathoners and smash their personal bests. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Hansons Marathon Method&lt;/em&gt; tosses out mega-long runs and high-mileage weekends--two old-fashioned running traditions that often injure and discourage runners. Runners using the Hansons method will gradually build up to the moderate-high mileage required for marathon success, spreading those miles more sensibly throughout the week. Running easy days mixed with precisely paced speed, strength, and tempo workouts, runners will steel their bodies and minds to run the hardest final miles of the marathon--and finish strong. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this new second edition, the Hansons program welcomes newer runners with a new Just Finish program featuring a simple schedule of easier running and lower mileage. The Just Finish program sets up first-time marathoners for an enjoyable marathon and a lifetime of strong, healthy running. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Hansons Marathon Method&lt;/em&gt; will prepare you for your best marathon:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Sensible weekly mileage based on science, not outdated traditions&lt;li&gt;Effective Hansons speed, strength, and tempo workouts paced to achieve your goal&lt;li&gt;Crucial nutrition and hydration guidelines to run strong for the whole race&lt;li&gt;A smart and simple Just Finish program for new runners and marathon first-timers&lt;li&gt;Detailed training schedules for experienced and advanced marathoners&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;This revised second edition answers frequently asked questions, shows how to integrate flexibility and strength work into your training week, and shares the most effective recovery methods. Using the Hansons&#39; innovative approach, you will mold real marathon muscles, train your body to avoid the wall, and finish strong. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Hansons Marathon Method&lt;/em&gt; lays out the smartest marathon training program available from one of the most accomplished running groups in the world. Using their innovative approach, runners will mold real marathon muscles, train their body to never hit the wall, and prepare to run their fastest marathon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;You might expect a training program devised by the Hanson brothers to be a little different than the usual rehashing of principles and schedules. Given the success of athletes from the Hansons-Brooks Distance Project, you wouldn&#39;t be surprised if it was effective, too.&quot; -- &lt;b&gt;&lt;em&gt;Runner&#39;s World&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />
