  <title>Shea Stadium Remembered - Matthew Silverman</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt; Few remember that Shea Stadium&amp;mdash;and indeed the Mets baseball club itself&amp;mdash;arose out of a dispute between two oversized egos: New York City official Robert Moses and Brooklyn Dodgers owner Walter O&amp;rsquo;Malley. While O&amp;rsquo;Malley wanted complete control over a new stadium and all of its concessions in Brooklyn, Moses insisted that the stadium be built by the city in Queens and leased to the Dodgers. The impasse led to the Dodgers following the Giants out to the West Coast, where The City of Los Angeles granted O&amp;rsquo;Malley all of the concessions he had sought in New York. With now no National League team in the New York area, the National League office awarded a new franchise to the city in 1960 on conditional that it fund and build a new stadium, which the Mets (and later the AFL Jets) would lease.

By the time of its demolition in 2008, the Mets had played more games at Shea than the Dodgers had ever played at Ebbets Field, and the stadium had hosted seven National League Championship Series, four World Series, three Jets playoff games, and the American Football League Championship game in 1968. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;" />
