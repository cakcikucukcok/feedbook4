      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Jim Dent, author of the New York Times bestselling The Junction Boys returns with the remarkable and inspiring story of one of the biggest comebacks in college football history.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the 1960&#39;s, Notre Dame&#39;s football program was in shambles. Little did anyone know, help was on its way in the form of Ara Parseghian, a controversial choice for head coach--the first one outside of the Notre Dame &quot;family.&quot; It was now his responsibility to rebuild the once-proud program and teach the Fighting Irish how to win again. But it was no small task.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The men of Notre Dame football were a bunch of unlikelies and oddballs, but Parseghian transformed them into a team: a senior quarterback who would win the Heisman Trophy; a five-foot-eight walk-on who would make first team All-American; an exceptionally rare black player, who would overcome much more than his quiet demeanor to rise to All-American, All-Pro, Hall of Famer, and to the Minnesota Supreme Court. Parseghian would change everything, from the uniforms and pads to the offensive strategy. It would be a huge gamble against great obstacles. But Ara Parseghian had that look in his eye....&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;       New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author Jim Dent chronicles one of the greatest comeback seasons in the history of college football. Once again confirming his position as one of the top sports writers in the country, Dent brings the legends of Notre Dame football to life in an unforgettable story of second chances, determination, and unwavering spirit.&lt;/p&gt;" />
