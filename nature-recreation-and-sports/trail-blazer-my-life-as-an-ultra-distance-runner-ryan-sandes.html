  <title>Trail Blazer: My Life as an Ultra-distance Runner - Ryan Sandes</title>
      <meta name="description" content="What does it take to run a six-day race through the world&#39;s harshest deserts? Or 100 miles in a single day at altitudes that would leave you breathless just walking? More than that, though: what is it like to win these races? South Africa&#39;s ultra-trail-running superstar Ryan Sandes has done just that. Since bursting onto the international trail-running scene by winning the first multistage race he ever entered - the brutal Gobi March - Ryan has gone on to win various other multistage and single-day races around the globe. Written with bestselling author and journalist Steve Smith, Trail Blazer - My Life as an Ultra-distance Trail Runner recounts the life story of this intrepid sportsman, from his experiences as a rudderless party animal to becoming a world-class athlete, and includes details on his training regimes, race strategies and aspirations for future sporting endeavours. Sports enthusiasts will enjoy the adrenaline-inducing trials and tribulations of one of South Africa&#39;s most awe-inspiring athletes, while endurance-sport participants - from beginners to aspirant pros - will benefit from his insights and advice. As Professor Tim Noakes says in the Foreword to this book: &#39;However much we might think we know and understand, there are some phenomena which now, and perhaps forever, we will never fully comprehend. We call such happenings &quot;enigmas&quot;. Or even miracles. Ryan Sandes is one such.&#39;" />
