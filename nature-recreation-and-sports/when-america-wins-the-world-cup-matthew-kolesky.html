  <title>When America Wins the World Cup - Matthew Kolesky</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Soccer has deep roots in America, deeper than most countries that have won the World Cup. These domestic soccer roots need to be cultivated and showcased to Americas soccer fans. In &lt;i&gt;When America Wins the World Cup&lt;/i&gt;, author Matthew Kolesky answers the questions of what it will take for America to win the World Cup and what will happen when that occurs.&lt;p&gt;
Intended to ride the growing wave of popularity for soccer in America and to enhance it, Kolesky:&lt;p&gt;
	Looks at the history of the sport through its significant mileposts in the development of the game in America&lt;br&gt;
	Includes his personal experiences as a fan as well as those of other fans&lt;br&gt;
	Provides information about the basics of the game of soccer&lt;br&gt;
	Shares misconceptions about the sport in and out of America&lt;br&gt;
	Offers insight into the continued quest for the World Cup&lt;p&gt;
With anecdotes included, &lt;i&gt;When America Wins the World Cup&lt;/i&gt; illustrates that Americans can be passionate about the global game. Soccer is building again in America, and the rest of the world is slowly starting to realize the United States is taking soccer seriously at the national level." />
