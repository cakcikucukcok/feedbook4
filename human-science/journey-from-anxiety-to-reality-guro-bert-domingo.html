  <title>Journey from Anxiety to Reality - Guro Bert Domingo</title>
      <meta name="description" content="We are born into this world helpless, dependent and uninformed.  As a product of genetics and environment, we have no choice where we are born, who our parents are, how we are going to be nurtured, when in time are we to make an appearance, and why we exist.  All these uncertainties naturally create the anxieties as we become mindful of our circumscriptions.  Later, we learn that crying can get attention.  As people respond to our needs, we realize our power.  As we stumble on ways of calling attention to our needs, we discover that there are limits to what we can demand.  When our needs are not satisfied, our fears magnified..  Good parenting gave us tools for survival.   Later, we gain control of our desires, and learn to determine our own destiny.  We can define our dreams, hopes and expectations for our future. Anyone can make own odessy of self analysis using introspective self analysis (ISA) to discover, the meaning and purpose of life and the causative factors of behaviors." />
