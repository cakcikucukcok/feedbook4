  <title>Living Outside Mental Illness - Larry Davidson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Schizophrenia is widely considered the most severe and disabling of the mental illnesses. Yet recent research has demonstrated that many people afflicted with the disorder are able to recover to a significant degree.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;B&gt;Living Outside Mental Illness&lt;/B&gt; demonstrates the importance of listening to what people diagnosed with schizophrenia themselves have to say about their struggle, and shows the dramatic effect this approach can have on clinical practice and social policy. It presents an in-depth investigation, based on a phenomenological perspective, of experiences of illness and recovery as illuminated by compelling first-person descriptions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This volume forcefully makes the case for the utility of qualitative methods in improving our understanding of the reasons for the success or failure of mental health services. The research has important clinical and policy implications, and will be of key interest to those in psychology and the helping professions as well as to people in recovery and their families.&lt;/p&gt;" />
