  <title>S&amp;oslash;ren Kierkegaard: Subjectivity, Irony, &amp;amp;amp; the Crisis of Modernity - Jon Stewart</title>
      <meta name="description" content="S&amp;oslash;ren Kierkegaard: Subjectivity, Irony, and the Crisis of Modernity examines the thought of S&amp;oslash;ren Kierkegaard, a unique figure, who has inspired, provoked, fascinated, and irritated people ever since he walked the streets of Copenhagen. At the end of his life, Kierkegaard said that the only model he had for his work was the Greek philosopher Socrates. This work takes this statement as its point of departure. Jon Stewart explores whatKierkegaard meant by this and to show how different aspects of his writing and argumentative strategy can be traced back to Socrates. The main focus is The Concept of Irony, which is a key text at the beginning of Kierkegaards literary career. Although it was an early work, it nevertheless played a determining role in his laterdevelopment and writings. Indeed, it can be said that it laid the groundwork for much of what would appear in his later famous books such as Either/Or and Fear and Trembling." />
