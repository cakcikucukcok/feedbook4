  <title>The Marvel of Martyrdom - Sophia Moskalenko, Clark McCauley</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;em&gt;The Marvel of Martyrdom&lt;/em&gt; is about how self-sacrifice can change lives and how martyrs can change the world.
The book starts large -- with famous and influential martyrs such as Jesus and Gandhi -- and ends small -- with ordinary people whose own experiences of self-sacrifice give martyrdom its political power.  Seeking  the developmental origins of self-sacrifice, the book  explores children&#39;s folklore and  the success of  mega-hits such as &lt;em&gt;The Matrix&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Harry Potter&lt;/em&gt;. Seeking the everyday rewards of self-sacrifice, the book shows  the potential for finding meaning and happiness in helping others.
&lt;em&gt;The Marvel of Martyrdom&lt;/em&gt; takes a broad perspective on self-sacrifice and martyrdom, bringing together religion, popular culture, history, psychology and mythology. Stories of individuals both famous (Gandhi) and obscure (Rodrigo Rosenberg) intertwine with research on altruism, happiness, and radicalization to terrorism. The changing landscape of the book&#39;s setting -- from The Roman Empire to 19th century Russia to Nazi Germany to post-War II India, to present day Ukraine -- makes the power of self-sacrifice and martyrdom come alive and shows their potential to change people and cultures." />
