  <title>An Introduction to Yoga - Annie Besant</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This anthology is a thorough introduction to classic literature for those who have not yet experienced these literary masterworks. For those who have known and loved these works in the past, this is an invitation to reunite with old friends in a fresh new format. From Shakespeare&amp;rsquo;s finesse to Oscar Wilde&amp;rsquo;s wit, this unique collection brings together works as diverse and influential as The Pilgrim&amp;rsquo;s Progress and Othello.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Annie Besant (1 October 1847 &amp;ndash; 20 September 1933) was a British socialist, theosophist, women&amp;#39;s rights activist, writer and orator and supporter of Irish and Indian self-rule.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
In 1867, Annie at age 20, married Frank Besant, a clergyman, and they had two children, but Annie&amp;#39;s increasingly anti-religious views led to a legal separation in 1873. She then became a prominent speaker for the National Secular Society (NSS) and writer and a close friend of Charles Bradlaugh. In 1877 they were prosecuted for publishing a book by birth control campaigner Charles Knowlton. The scandal made them famous, and Bradlaugh was elected M.P. for Northampton in 1880.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
She became involved with union actions including the Bloody Sunday demonstration and the London matchgirls strike of 1888. She was a leading speaker for the Fabian Society and the Marxist Social Democratic Federation (SDF). She was elected to the London School Board for Tower Hamlets, topping the poll even though few women were qualified to vote at that time." />
