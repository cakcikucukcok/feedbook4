  <title>Support Processes in Intimate Relationships - Kieran T. Sullivan, Joanne Davila</title>
      <meta name="description" content="In the past twenty years or so, research on support processes in relationships has emerged as a distinct development in the field.  Researchers have drawn from studies in the fields of communication, social support, and intimate relationships to conduct research examining support processes in relationships on micro and macro levels.  Theoretical models of support processes in intimate relationships have been developed and increasingly sophisticated methodologies and data analytic techniques are being used to accumulate considerable and convincing evidence of the importance and complexity of support processes in intimate relationships.  This edited book offers a broad yet coherent view of the field, showcasing novel, state-of-the-art research and theory on support processes in intimate relationships.  Cutting-edge scholarly work is compiled in one accessible volume, which is designed to provoke and guide new research on social support.  The book is divided into five sections designed to reflect emerging themes in the literature on support processes and intimate relationships. Getting What One Wants: Perceived Support in Intimate Relationships highlights the importance of offering support that is consistent with the needs of the recipient.  Providing What Partners Need: Interpersonal Aspects of Support focuses on the importance of empathic understanding, validation of support seekers needs, attachment styles, and the emotional context for effective support provision. Complexities of Support Processes in Individual and Couple Well Being highlights the complex nature of support, presenting research on the effects of partner support on coping with stress, differential responses to daily support, and the importance of providing support for positive events.  Support in the Context of Health-related Problems and Behaviors is comprised of chapters describing the effects of support on health, illness, and injury.  Finally, Culture and Gender presents research that explores the role of gender and culture in support processes in couples." />
