      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Life has often been said to be a mystery or full of mysteries, and rightly so, because as we journey through life we often encounter one or more of these mysteries; which tends to make life a very complex puzzle. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wouldnt it be helpful if before you are presented with a puzzle you already know how to solve it? Wouldnt it be very nice if you could understand the things which to others, seemingly, are complicated? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;LIFE: A MYSTERY SOLVED provides you with a few hints which would assist you with unravelling some of lifes many mysteries; it also breaks down some of the complexities of life into simpler and easily-understandable components. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It takes you on a journey, from the beginning of life in its natural state to its inevitable end, but which doesnt terminate at death but continues with a brief preview of how the journey would continuea glimpse into the future.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Have you any yet-to-be answered questions about life? Is life a mystery to you? Do you sometimes wish you knew why you were born? Are you confident you know who you truly are? Are you fed up with the way things are, personally and generally? Do you desire a better life or world? Afraid of dying? Not sure what to expect after death? LIFE: A MYSTERY SOLVED would be of immense help to you.&lt;/p&gt;" />
