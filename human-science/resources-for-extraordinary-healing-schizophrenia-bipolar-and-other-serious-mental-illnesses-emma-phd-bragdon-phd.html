  <title>Resources for Extraordinary Healing: Schizophrenia, Bipolar and Other Serious Mental Illnesses - Emma PhD Bragdon PhD</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Sixteen million Americans (5% of our population) are crippled by serious mental illness according to the National Institute of Mental Health.  A lead article in Reuters News in August 2011 reported that 40% of people (201 million) in the European Union are mentally ill or have brain disorders.  The numbers of mentally-disabled&amp;ndash;from tots to seniors&amp;ndash; needing supplemental income supplied by their governments is swelling at an alarming rate.  In the USA it&amp;#39;s 6 times what it was in 1955.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Can one recover from serious mental imbalance?  How?  These questions are increasingly important to emotionally disturbed people  and the governments supporting them.  It&amp;#39;s crazy, but top research psychiatrists now admit &amp;quot;We still don&amp;#39;t know the cause of most mental illness; indicators show it is not a &amp;#39;broken brain&amp;#39; that can be fixed by medications.&amp;quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Resources for Extraordinary Healing exposes a new paradigm about the causes of mental disturbances and maps pathways to full recovery.  An effective model of care from Brazil that has been developed since the 1930s is described.  The treatment addresses biological, psychosocial, and spiritual issues&amp;ndash; not separately, but together.  The collaborating healthcare team is made up of medical doctors, psychiatrists, medical intuitives and spiritual healers.  Trained volunteers bring compassionate understanding and companionship.  It is more cost-effective than our system.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Compelling stories point to accessible resources in the USA that are similar to what Brazil offers.  Contact information is well organized, making this book an excellent guide and an inspiring reference for patients, their families, psychotherapists, psychiatrists and healthcare providers.  It will be of value anywhere people seek information, compassionate care, and illuminating perspective on recovering mental health." />
