  <title>SCIENCE AS AN INTERPRETATION OF THE WORLD - Avijit Lahiri</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;This book is an in-depth and engaging discourse on the deeply cognitive roots of human scientific quest. The process of making scientific inferences is continuous with the day-to-day inferential activity of people and is predominantly inductive in nature. Inductive inference, which is fallible, exploratory, and open-ended, is of essential relevance in our incessant efforts at making sense of a complex and uncertain world around us, and covers a vast range of cognitive activities, among which scientific exploration constitutes the pinnacle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Inductive inference has a personal aspect to it, being rooted in the cognitive unconscious of individuals, which has recently been found to be of paramount importance in a wide range of complex cognitive processes. One other major aspect of the process of inference making, including the making of scientific inference, is the role of a vast web of beliefs lodged in the human mind, as also of a huge repertoire of heuristics, that constitute an important component of &amp;lsquo;unconscious intelligence&amp;rsquo;. Finally, human cognitive activity is dependent in a large measure on emotions and affects that operate mostly at an unconscious level. Of special importance in scientific inferential activity is the process of hypothesis making, which is examined in this book, along with the above aspects of inductive inference, at considerable depth.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The book focuses on the inadequacy of the viewpoint of naive realism in understanding the contextuality of scientific theories, where a cumulative progress towards an ultimate truth about Nature appears to be too simplistic a generalization. It poses a critique to the commonly perceived image of science where it is seen as the last word in logic and objectivity, the latter in the double sense of being independent of individual psychological propensities and, at the same time, approaching cumulatively to a correct understanding of the workings of a mind-independent nature. Adopting the naturalist point of view, it examines the essential tension between the cognitive endeavours of individuals and scientific communities, immersed in belief systems and cultures, on the one hand, and the engagement with a mind-independent reality on the other. In the end, science emerges as an interpretation of nature, which is perceived by us only contextually, as successively emerging cross-sections of a limited scope and extent. Successive waves of theory building in science appear as episodic changes in perspective, rather than as a cumulative progress towards some ultimate truth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The presentation is lucid, informal, and non-technical, but cogent and authentic, making for a compelling reading.&lt;br /&gt;
Avijit Lahiri has a background of teaching and research in physics, and has had a long-standing interest in the philosophy of science.&lt;/p&gt;" />
