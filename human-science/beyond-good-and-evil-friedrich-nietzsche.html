  <title>Beyond Good and Evil - Friedrich Nietzsche</title>
      <meta name="description" content="It seems that in order to inscribe themselves upon the heart of humanity with everlasting claims, all great things have first to wander about the earth as enormous and awe-inspiring caricatures: dogmatic philosophy has been a caricature of this kind&amp;mdash;for instance, the Vedanta doctrine in Asia, and Platonism in Europe. Let us not be ungrateful to it, although it must certainly be confessed that the worst, the most tiresome, and the most dangerous of errors hitherto has been a dogmatist error&amp;mdash;namely, Plato&amp;#39;s invention of Pure Spirit and the Good in Itself. But now when it has been surmounted, when Europe, rid of this nightmare, can again draw breath freely and at least enjoy a healthier&amp;mdash;sleep, we, WHOSE DUTY IS WAKEFULNESS ITSELF, are the heirs of all the strength which the struggle against this error has fostered. It amounted to the very inversion of truth, and the denial of the PERSPECTIVE&amp;mdash;the fundamental condition&amp;mdash;of life, to speak of Spirit and the Good as Plato spoke of them; indeed one might ask, as a physician: &amp;quot;How did such a malady attack that finest product of antiquity, Plato?
