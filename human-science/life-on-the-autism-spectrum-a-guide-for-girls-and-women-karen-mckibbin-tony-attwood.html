  <title>Life on the Autism Spectrum - A Guide for Girls and Women - Karen McKibbin, Tony Attwood</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Why is Autism Spectrum Disorder so misunderstood in girls and women and why do so many go under the radar without the support that they need? This practical guide explains the unique issues that affect females with autism and provides tools and strategies that girls, women and their families can use in day-to-day life.  Following the story of Alison, a girl diagnosed with Asperger Syndrome, through both childhood and adulthood, we get an inside view of the challenges that girls and women with autism face. Straightforward information and advice is provided on key topics including:  ·         social skills and communication ·         how to overcome bullying ·         sensory issues and food sensitivity ·         the need for routine ·         perceptions of gender ·         and physiological changes.  Essential reading for parents of daughters on the spectrum, as well as girls and women who carry the diagnosis themselves." />
