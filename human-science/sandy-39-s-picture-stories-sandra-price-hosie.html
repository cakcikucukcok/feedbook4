      <meta name="description" content="Sandy&#39;s Picture Stories is designed for busy teachers of Beginner ESL. Each Unit is based on a topic useful for new immigrants like &quot;The Noisy Neighbor&quot; or &quot;The Burglar&quot;. Every Unit begins with a series of pictures meant to be copies on to light card stock and cut into card sets. This is followed by a randomized card set of key words and another of sentences. Students are meant to sequence the pictures and invent the story, then match key words to pictures and revise their story. More advanced students can match the pictures with the sentence cards and to read the story to a partners. This if followed by a correct sentence sequence so students can read it silently and orally and adjust their picture stories if needed. Next we have a word scramble to reinforce vocabulary learning and scrambled sentences to build grammar and syntax awareness. The unit concludes with a listening exercise to further reinforce learning. The total two-hour lesson is quick and easy to prepare yet is engaging and involving so students participate eagerly. This is a handy book that all teachers of Beginner ESL will want to have." />
