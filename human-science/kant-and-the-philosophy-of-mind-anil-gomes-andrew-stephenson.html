  <title>Kant and the Philosophy of Mind - Anil Gomes, Andrew Stephenson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The essays in this volume explore those aspects of Kant&#39;s writings which concern issues in the philosophy of mind. These issues are central to any understanding of Kant&#39;s critical philosophy and they bear upon contemporary discussions in the philosophy of mind. Fourteen specially written essays address such questions as: What role does mental processing play in Kant&#39;s account of intuition? What kinds of empirical models can be given of these operations? In what
sense, and in what ways, are intuitions object-dependent? How should we understand the nature of the imagination? What is inner sense, and what does it mean to say that time is the form of inner sense? Can we cognize ourselves through inner sense? How do we self-ascribe our beliefs and what role does
self-consciousness play in our judgments? Is the will involved in judging? What kind of knowledge can we have of the self? And what kind of knowledge of the self does Kant proscribe?
These essays showcase the depth of Kant&#39;s writings in the philosophy of mind, and the centrality of those writings to his wider philosophical project. Moreover, they show the continued relevance of Kant&#39;s writings to contemporary debates about the nature of mind and self." />
