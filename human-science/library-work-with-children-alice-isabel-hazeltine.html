  <title>Library Work with Children - Alice Isabel Hazeltine</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;b&gt;Preface&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This second volume in the series of Classics of American Librarianship is devoted to library work with children. As stated in the preface to the first volume, on &amp;quot;Library and school,&amp;quot; the papers chosen are primarily of historic rather than of present-day value, although many of them embody principles which govern the practice of today. They have been grouped under general headings in order to bring more closely together material relating to the same or to similar subjects. Several different phases of children&amp;#39;s work are thus represented, although no attempt has been made to make the collection comprehensive.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The present volume is an attempt to bring together in accessible form papers representing the growth and tendencies of forty years of library work with children. ALICE I. HAZELTINE.&lt;br /&gt;
