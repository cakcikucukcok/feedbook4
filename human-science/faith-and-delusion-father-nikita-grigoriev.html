  <title>Faith and Delusion - Father Nikita Grigoriev</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This book is a giant jig-saw puzzle that took a lifetime to put together. The author has always been driven by a need to know, really know, and understand the essence of things and how they all relate to each other. To that end, he has studied many things, lived and worked in many countries and learned to do many different things. This book is the result of much reflection and inspiration in putting all the pieces together. This is an eagle&#39;s eye view of the human story from Adam to the Antichrist. It is the story of man&#39;s relationship with God, full of remarkable insight and touching compassion and inspiration. This is the story of the war against God for the heart of man. It is a unique and unprecedented book in its scope, clarity and conciseness." />
