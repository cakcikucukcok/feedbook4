  <title>51 Colors of Seduction - Rob Goldstein</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;This guide takes you on the adventure of enhancing your sex life, and of blowing each others minds in bed. Told in a series of erotic stories that tantalize the senses; you will be able to visualize how to live out your deepest fantasies, while respecting each others comfort zones. This book is not for everyone. If you are not into sexual adventures, sexual fantasies and satisfying your lover, then this book is probably not for you. But, if you are ready for a journey that pushes both of your boundaries to the point of no return and to give each other the best sex each of you have ever experienced; then read on, and dare to be a little naughty . . .or a lotta naughty, the choice is yours!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here you will learn how being monogamous can be an exciting experience filled with wild adventures that you can take together as a couple. Remember that it is all about communication. Everyone comes with a past, and that past most likely includes a past relationship, or relationships. Each person that we have been with touches our lives and forever shapes us. Some experiences make us better people, while others might leave us jaded, scarred, or carrying around some insecurities. The way in which you perceived your past relationships usually has some type of effect on your current relationship. Are you still friends with your ex? Is your current lady ok with that friendship? How do you feel about her ex?... This all plays a part in your sexuality and your boundaries as a couple.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So lets discuss boundaries and what they mean. Everybody has sexual values that are as unique as their thumbprint, and with those values, come boundaries. While we are all familiar with boundaries as they apply to business and social situations, sometimes sexual boundaries can get confusing. For example: Do you consider kissing, cheating?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What about massaging? Is she comfortable if a friend, (who happens to be a woman) massages your back? Miscommunication, and something as simple, and maybe even as innocent, as the above mentioned acts, can tear a couple apart. Both men and women have sexual fantasies; but there are some fantasies that we only think about but would never act out, while there are some fantasies that we would like to try with the right lover. Sexual boundaries, in essence, are our real compatibility factor. Push those boundaries too far, or infringe on each others boundaries, and it could be the ultimate deal breaker. However, playing it safe most always leaves both partners unfulfilled and unsatisfied. The lack of passion in a couples sex life is one of the top reasons for cheating, break-ups and divorce.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everyone has their list of dos and donts when it comes to what they will do, will consider, will try, and those that they would not ever do. Those that you or your partner say you will never do are called your TABOOS. Learning about each others taboos is equivalent to removing the bullets from your guns. You will never get slaughtered if you know where that ultimate line is. It could be that your partner would be okay with you talking to your ex; but would never, ever consider having your ex in the bedroom with you both. Maybe your partner will try being tied up, but would never, ever let you blindfold them. So, you can see the importance of knowing where each others taboos lie? It is also important to know where you can safely push each others boundaries.&lt;/p&gt;" />
