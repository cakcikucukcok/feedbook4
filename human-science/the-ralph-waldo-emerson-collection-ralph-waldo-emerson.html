  <title>The Ralph Waldo Emerson Collection - Ralph Waldo Emerson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Ralph Waldo Emerson&amp;nbsp;was an American essayist,&amp;nbsp;lecturer,&amp;nbsp;philosopher, and&amp;nbsp;poet&amp;nbsp;who led the&amp;nbsp;transcendentalist&amp;nbsp;movement of the mid-19th century. He was seen as a champion of&amp;nbsp;individualism&amp;nbsp;and a prescient critic of the countervailing pressures of society, and he disseminated his thoughts through dozens of published essays and more than 1,500 public lectures across the United States.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Emerson gradually moved away from the religious and social beliefs of his contemporaries, formulating and expressing the philosophy of transcendentalism in his 1836 essay &amp;quot;Nature&amp;quot;. Following this work, he gave a speech entitled &amp;quot;The American Scholar&amp;quot; in 1837, which&amp;nbsp;Oliver Wendell Holmes Sr.&amp;nbsp;considered to be America&amp;#39;s &amp;quot;intellectual Declaration of Independence.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Emerson wrote most of&amp;nbsp;his important essays&amp;nbsp;as lectures first and then revised them for print. His first two collections of essays,&amp;nbsp;&lt;i&gt;Essays: First Series&lt;/i&gt;&amp;nbsp;(1841) and&amp;nbsp;&lt;i&gt;Essays: Second Series&lt;/i&gt;&amp;nbsp;(1844), represent the core of his thinking. They include the well-known essays &amp;quot;Self-Reliance&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;The Over-Soul&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Circles&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;The Poet&amp;quot;, and &amp;quot;Experience.&amp;quot; Together with &amp;quot;Nature&amp;quot;, these essays made the decade from the mid-1830s to the mid-1840s Emerson&amp;#39;s most fertile period. Emerson wrote on a number of subjects, never espousing fixed philosophical&amp;nbsp;tenets, but developing certain ideas such as&amp;nbsp;individuality,&amp;nbsp;freedom, the ability for mankind to realize almost anything, and the relationship between the soul and the surrounding world. Emerson&amp;#39;s &amp;quot;nature&amp;quot; was more philosophical than&amp;nbsp;naturalistic: &amp;quot;Philosophically considered, the universe is composed of Nature and the Soul.&amp;quot; Emerson is one of several figures who &amp;quot;took a more&amp;nbsp;pantheist&amp;nbsp;or&amp;nbsp;pandeist&amp;nbsp;approach by rejecting views of God as separate from the world.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
He remains among the&amp;nbsp;linchpins&amp;nbsp;of the American romantic movement, and his work has greatly influenced the thinkers, writers and poets that followed him. &amp;quot;In all my lectures,&amp;quot; he wrote, &amp;quot;I have taught one doctrine, namely, the infinitude of the private man.&amp;quot; Emerson is also well known as a mentor and friend of&amp;nbsp;Henry David Thoreau, a fellow transcendentalist." />
