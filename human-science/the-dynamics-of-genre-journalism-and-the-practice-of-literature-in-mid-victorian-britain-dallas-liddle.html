  <title>The Dynamics of Genre: Journalism and the Practice of Literature in Mid-Victorian Britain - Dallas Liddle</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Newspapers, magazines, and other periodicals reached a peak of cultural influence     and financial success in Britain in the 1850s and 1860s, out-publishing and out-selling books as     much as one hundred to one. But although scholars have long known that writing for the vast     periodical marketplace provided many Victorian authors with needed income-and sometimes even     with full second careers as editors and journalists-little has been done to trace how the     midcentury ascendancy of periodical discourses might have influenced Victorian literary     discourse.&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In The Dynamics of Genre, Dallas Liddle innovatively     combines Mikhail Bakhtin&#39;s dialogic approach to genre with methodological tools from     periodicals studies, literary criticism, and the history of the book to offer the first rigorous     study of the relationship between mid-Victorian journalistic genres and contemporary poetry, the     novel, and serious expository prose. Liddle shows that periodical genres competed both     ideologically and economically with literary genres, and he studies how this competition     influenced the midcentury writings and careers of authors including Elizabeth Barrett Browning,     Harriet Martineau, Anthony Trollope, George Eliot, and the sensation novelists of the 1860s.     Some Victorian writers directly adopted the successful genre forms and worldview of journalism,     but others such as Eliot strongly rejected them, while Trollope launched his successful career     partly by using fiction to analyze journalism&#39;s growing influence in British society.     Liddle argues that successful interpretation of the works of these and many other authors will     be fully possible only when scholars learn to understand the journalistic genre forms with which     mid-Victorian literary forms interacted and competed.&lt;/p&gt;" />
