  <title>Moments of Being and Becoming - Leyla Savsar</title>
      <meta name="description" content="I have a deeply hidden and inarticulate desire for something beyond the daily life. 
-Virginia Woolf 
Maybe I just am- 
Or waiting to become. 
This collection of prose-like poetry portrays the moments of being and becoming that have materialized from the clear-eyed perspective of a child. It urges the reader to take the time to look around and notice how everything old is enveloped in a sense of newness. It paints a picture of a timeless state and stateless time, where nothing manages to escape the undoing of the past and yet everything becomes tinted with the undertones of change unfolding before the poets gaze. Places traveled. A home lost and several homes found. The foreign and the familiar. Sights. Smells. Sunsets. The names and the faces behind them. These poems embody the search for peace in the heart of chaos, a sense of calm in the wake of turbulence, and a center from the margins at best. These moments shared find the poet and reader at a crossroads where the soul is satisfied and kept vital only when it is given the chance to explore both the old in the new and the new in the old. May these moments fuel your search as you seek to find your own, set out to be and become. Keep looking and keep searching, for it is your findings that flow into the vast oceans of our collective being-a timeless state that transcends the daily life." />
