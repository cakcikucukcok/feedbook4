  <title>Enigmajik 3 - Jeff Harmon</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Hello reader.  You have just picked up a book that might be some help to you in your life.  How can this book be helpful?  This book is designed to solve some of the many problems that a person has in their life.  Techniques are suggested to alleviate these problems, and motivation is given.  We all have a constant battle going on in our minds, and these books will strengthen you for the battle.  This current book is full of precepts that will challenge the readers mind, causing reflection, introspection and contemplation.  No matter what kind of person you are, you probably can find a place in  my book.  The book is divided into three parts, using three different writing styles.  This challenges the readers perceptions, and forces reflection.  Though both are important, the inner person, instead of the outer, is more or less concentrated on.  The true object of this book, and its predecessors, is to strengthen the spirit that lies in one, and make one more apt to accomplish goals.  I hope this book does just that for you, and I hope much more.  May the reader persevere in their quest for enimajik!" />
