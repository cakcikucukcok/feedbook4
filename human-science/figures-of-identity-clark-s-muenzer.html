  <title>Figures of Identity - Clark  S. Muenzer</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The question of coherence in Goethe&#39;s novels, which, like &lt;em&gt;Faust&lt;/em&gt;, compelled his attention throughout his creative life, has only recently occupied a few critics. Professor Muenzer&#39;s study offers the most comprehensive effort of this kind by examining the problematic nature of self-definition through the four novels and its emergence as a discursive process of the imagination.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The self of these texts, Muenzer suggests, evolves as a symbolic construct that records a patter of pursuit for each of their protagonists and orients the reader toward three basic goals of human aspiration. Thus, Werther aspires to purposefulness as a center of teleological fulfillment, while the hero of &lt;em&gt;Wilhelm Meister&#39;s Apprenticeship&lt;/em&gt; refers to an ideological center of participation in his social desire. Eduard, in &lt;em&gt;The Elective Affinities&lt;/em&gt;, presumes to occupy a center of archaeological power through his typically self-assertive strategies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the last of his novels, &lt;em&gt;Wilhelm Meister&#39;s Journeymanship&lt;/em&gt;, Goethe articulates the need to balance all such self-involved behavior with an attitude of self-denial. Apparently, the mind can orient itself through centers of purpose, order, and power, but it must also recognize the illusion of their attainment. Identity does not involve a substantive presence, and the result of self-definition for Goethe is interpretive work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each of Professor Muenzer&#39;s interpretations has been guided by this premise. The interests of all of Goethe&#39;s novelistic protagonists, he concludes, &amp;quot;serve as orienting postures toward goals that cannot be literally achieved.&amp;quot; Consequently, symbolic resolutions are proposed. These then introduce new problems as points of departure in subsequent works. The hidden agenda of Goethe&#39;s work as a novelist is a self that exists as a textual problem, a series of interpretive moves that endlessly defer the attainment of self presence by supplementing each other in narrative fictions.&lt;/p&gt;" />
