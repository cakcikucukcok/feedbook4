  <title>The Confucius Collection - Confucius</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Confucius&amp;nbsp;was a Chinese&amp;nbsp;philosopher&amp;nbsp;and politician of the&amp;nbsp;Spring and Autumn period.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The philosophy of Confucius, also known as&amp;nbsp;Confucianism, emphasized personal and governmental morality, correctness of social relationships, justice and sincerity. His followers competed successfully with many other schools during the&amp;nbsp;Hundred Schools of Thought&amp;nbsp;era only to be suppressed in favor of the&amp;nbsp;Legalists&amp;nbsp;during the&amp;nbsp;Qin dynasty. Following the victory of&amp;nbsp;Han&amp;nbsp;over&amp;nbsp;Chu&amp;nbsp;after the collapse of Qin, Confucius&amp;#39;s thoughts received official sanction and were further developed into a system known in the West as&amp;nbsp;Neo-Confucianism, and later&amp;nbsp;New Confucianism (Modern Neo-Confucianism).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Confucius is traditionally credited with having authored or edited many of the&amp;nbsp;Chinese classic texts&amp;nbsp;including all of the&amp;nbsp;Five Classics, but modern scholars are cautious of attributing specific assertions to Confucius himself.&amp;nbsp;Aphorisms&amp;nbsp;concerning his teachings were compiled in the&amp;nbsp;&lt;i&gt;Analects&lt;/i&gt;, but only many years after his death.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Confucius&amp;#39;s principles have commonality with Chinese tradition and belief. He championed strong family loyalty,&amp;nbsp;ancestor veneration, and respect of elders by their children and of husbands by their wives, recommending family as a basis for ideal government. He espoused the well-known principle &amp;quot;Do not do unto others what you do not want done to yourself&amp;quot;, the&amp;nbsp;Golden Rule. He is also a traditional deity in&amp;nbsp;Daoism.&lt;br /&gt;
Confucius is widely considered as one of the most important and influential individuals in shaping human history. His teaching and philosophy greatly impacted people around the world and remains influential today." />
