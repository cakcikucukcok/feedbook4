  <title>Rethinking Narcissism - Dr. Craig Malkin</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Harvard Medical School psychologist and &lt;em&gt;Huffington Post&lt;/em&gt; blogger Craig Malkin addresses the &amp;#34;narcissism epidemic,&amp;#34; by illuminating the spectrum of narcissism, identifying ways to control the trait, and explaining how too little of it may be a bad thing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#34;What is narcissism?&amp;#34; is one of the fastest rising searches on Google, and articles on the topic routinely go viral. Yet, the word &amp;#34;narcissist&amp;#34; seems to mean something different every time it&amp;#39;s uttered. People hurl the word as insult at anyone who offends them. It&amp;#39;s become so ubiquitous, in fact, that it&amp;#39;s lost any clear meaning. The only certainty these days is that it&amp;#39;s bad to be a narcissist&amp;#8212;really bad&amp;#8212;inspiring the same kind of roiling queasiness we feel when we hear the words sexist or racist. That&amp;#39;s especially troubling news for millennials, the people born after 1980, who&amp;#39;ve been branded the &amp;#34;most narcissistic generation ever.&amp;#34;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In &lt;em&gt;Rethinking Narcissism&lt;/em&gt; readers will learn that there&amp;#39;s far more to narcissism than its reductive invective would imply. The truth is that we all fall on a spectrum somewhere between utter selflessness on the one side, and arrogance and grandiosity on the other. A healthy middle exhibits a strong sense of self. On the far end lies sociopathy. Malkin deconstructs healthy from unhealthy narcissism and offers clear, step-by-step guidance on how to promote healthy narcissism in our partners, our children, and ourselves.&lt;/p&gt;" />
