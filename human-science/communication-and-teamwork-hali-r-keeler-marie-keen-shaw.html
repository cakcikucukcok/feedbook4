  <title>Communication and Teamwork - Hali R. Keeler, Marie Keen Shaw</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Support staff in all types of libraries must work together in a variety of situations. This is both a textbook and on-the-job manual covering the skills and behaviors necessary for effective teamwork and communication. Trained library support staff should know the basic concepts of interpersonal relations, customer service, teamwork, and communication&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight:bold;&quot;&gt;. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;The range and diversity of staff in today&amp;rsquo;s library requires that support staff understand and implement these basic principles.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;The chapters of this book are carefully and purposefully aligned with the new American Library Association &amp;ndash; Library Support Staff Certification (LSSC) competency standards for Communication and Teamwork. Each chapter begins with the LSSC Competencies that are to be addressed, a help to instructors who use this book as a teaching text. This is followed by a list of topics that will be covered as well as a glossary of key terms. Chapters are then broken into easily readable sections that relate back to the key terms. No other book is available that uses the ALA-LSSC standards as the focus for teaching through practical examples how library support staff can effectively use them on the job.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Other books on this topic are written at a level that is aimed for professional librarians and not support staff. However, 85% of library support staff does not hold professional degrees. Written in clear language, this book will help library support staff become effective public service personnel.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;line-height:1.15&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;" />
