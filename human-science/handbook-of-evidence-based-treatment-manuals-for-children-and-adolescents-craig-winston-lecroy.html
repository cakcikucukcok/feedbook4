  <title>Handbook of Evidence-Based Treatment Manuals for Children and Adolescents - Craig Winston LeCroy</title>
      <meta name="description" content="With the advance of evidence-based practice has come the publication of numerous dense volumes reviewing the theoretical and empirical components of child and adolescent treatment. There are also a variety of detailed treatment manuals that describe the step-by-step procedures to guide ongoing research and practice. The second edition of Craig Winston LeCroys Handbook of Evidence-Based Child and Adolescent Treatment Manuals is a forceful combination of the two approaches, as he gathers fifteen varied treatment manuals and brief summaries of the research supporting each to ensure that practitioners will truly understand how to implement the treatments they are using.    A completely revised and expanded edition of the handbooks first edition, this is an essential guide to some of the best programs for helping children and teens. Each chapter begins with an explanatory section that discusses the theoretical and empirical underpinnings of the programs. The treatment manual follows, leading readers through sessions with specific details about conducting the treatment that have been refined and improved through extensive testing and research. Organized into three sections: the major clinical disorders, social problems confronting children and teens, and preventive interventions the Handbook brings together some of the most esteemed researcher-practitioners in the child and adolescent field. The book presents an impressive variety of innovative treatment programs and techniques including: the SiHLE program (intended to prevent problems confronting children and teens, and preventive interventions the Handbook brings together some of the most esteemed researcher-practitioners in the child and adolescent field. The book presents an impressive variety of innovative treatment programs and techniques including: the SiHLE program (intended to prevent HIV through education and self-esteem building), the Children of Divorce Intervention Program (a therapy for younger children stressing resilience and skill-building), and Strengths Oriented Family Therapy (which reaches out to substance-involved adolescents and their families).    The Handbook of Evidence-Based Child and Adolescent Treatment Manuals is an indispensable reference for researchers, graduate students, and practitioners working with children and adolescents in a multitude of settings, from schools and juvenile correction centers to group homes and family service agencies." />
