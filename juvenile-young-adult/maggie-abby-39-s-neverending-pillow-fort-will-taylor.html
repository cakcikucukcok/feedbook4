WHOLE. WEEKS. But now that Abby&amp;#8217;s finally home, she&amp;#8217;s&amp;#8230;different. All New Abby wants to do is talk about camp things and plan campy activities&amp;#8212;she even has the nerve to call Maggie&amp;#8217;s massive, award-worthy pillow fort a &amp;#8220;cabin.&amp;#8221;&amp;#160;&amp;#160; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But hey, at least she&amp;#8217;s willing to build a &amp;#8220;cabin&amp;#8221; of her own. And when Maggie discovers that a pillow in the back of her fort mysteriously leads right into Abby&amp;#8217;s new one, the two friends are suddenly just an arm&amp;#8217;s length away.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Soon they&amp;#8217;re adding links and building more forts, until Maggie looks behind one pillow too many and finds herself face-to-face with...the authorities.&amp;#160; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Turns out their little pillow fort network isn&amp;#8217;t the first to exist.

There&amp;#8217;s only a little bit of summer left to burn, and Maggie and Abby are both determined to win back their pillow fort freedom.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But can their friendship&amp;#8212;and their scrappy homemade network&amp;#8212;survive the mission? &lt;/p&gt;" />
