  <title>THE STORY OF THE HUMPBACK - A Children’s Story from 1001 Arabian Nights - Anon E. Mouse, Narrated by Baba Indaba</title>
      <meta name="description" content="ISSN: 2397-9607 Issue 240&lt;br /&gt;
In this 240th issue of the Baba Indaba&amp;rsquo;s Children&amp;#39;s Stories series, Baba Indaba narrates The Story of the Humpack - straight from the Arabian Nights.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
A tailor and his wife are on their way home after a night out when they meet a humpbacked man, who, when looked at, gave rise to laughter in the angry, and dispelled anxiety and grief in the sad. So they approached him and invited him to return with them to their house to pass the rest evening. While eating a meal of fish, bread and limes, a bone stuck in the humpback&amp;rsquo;s throat and he expired. The man and his wife lament the humpback&amp;rsquo;s passing and wonder what to do with him.&lt;br /&gt;
What follows is a comedy of errors which results in an almost disastrous result.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
But, word has got to the Sultan about the weird and wonderful goings on down at the scaffold in the marketplace and the Sultan sends his Chamberlain to ascertain what was happening. The Chamberlain arrives just in time to bring order to situation. He then takes all the characters before the Sultan who demands an explanation.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
What did the Sultan hear? But more importantly, what did he do? Did he pass judgement and were they all sentenced to a term in prison, or maybe even to hang? What happens next? Well you&amp;rsquo;ll just have to download and read this bumper 205 page edition of the Story of the Humpback with sumptuous illustrations which also has a further 10 tales woven into its thread.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Baba Indaba is a fictitious Zulu storyteller who narrates children&amp;#39;s stories from around the world. Baba Indaba translates as &amp;quot;Father of Stories&amp;quot;.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Each issue also has a &amp;quot;WHERE IN THE WORLD - LOOK IT UP&amp;quot; section, where young readers are challenged to look up a place on a map somewhere in the world. The place, town or city is relevant to the story. HINT - use Google maps.&lt;br /&gt;
It is our hope that in looking up these place names using Google Maps, that young people will be able to see the images and read about other peoples and cultures from around the world. Through this, it is also our hope that young people will not only increase their understanding of world geography, but also increase their understanding and tolerance of other people and their cultures.&lt;br /&gt;
