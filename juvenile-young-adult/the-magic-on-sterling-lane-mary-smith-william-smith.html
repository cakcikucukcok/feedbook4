  <title>The Magic on Sterling Lane - Mary Smith, William Smith</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The Magic on Sterling Lane is a story about the animals in the back yard at the home of William and Mary Smith on Sterling Lane somewhere in Texas.
Have you ever sat on the porch watching your dog or a squirrel in a tree and thought, I wonder what they are thinking? well we have.  This story is about how we imagine life would be like as a squirrel or some other animal around us.   If they could talk so that you could understand them, maybe this is what you would hear.
We have two dogs, and it is really fun to watch them when they see one of the other animals in THEIR yard.  But thats OK because there is a small creek that runs beside our home so there is lots of green grass and water for all sorts of critters. 
As you read through this book you will meet Solomon, the Scottish terrier guard dog and 357 Maggie, his trusty patrol partner.  Maggie is very fast when she chases rabbits but she never quite catches them.  There are goats and horses, up the street, red tail hawks and every once in a while you will see a big blue heron or a bob cat. 
There are so many squirrels and rabbits you cant count them.  In this book you will be able to see and imagine our backyard with BIG oak trees and a garden railroad set.  
You will be able to close your eyes and see yourself sitting on the porch next to Marty talking to Sally Squirrel, or watching the brown rabbits playing in the field behind the house.
Our neighbors have said more than once that we had more songbirds in our yard than any other house in the neighborhood.  If you have a good imagination maybe you can hear some of the too." />
