  <title>Sorcerer&#39;s Ring (Books 8-9) - Morgan Rice</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&quot;THE SORCERER&#39;S RING has all the ingredients for an instant success: plots, counterplots, mystery, valiant knights, and blossoming relationships replete with broken hearts, deception and betrayal. It will keep you entertained for hours, and will satisfy all ages. Recommended for the permanent library of all fantasy readers.&quot;--Books and Movie Reviews. &lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This bundle includes books #8 (A GRANT OF ARMS) and #9 (A SKY OF SPELLS) in Morgan Rice&#39;s #1 Bestselling fantasy series THE SORCERER&#39;S RING, a 17 book epic fantasy series with over 1,000 five star reviews. The series begins with A QUEST OF HEROES!&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In A GRANT OF ARMS (Book #8 in the Sorcerer&#39;s Ring), Thor is caught between titanic forces of good and evil, as Andronicus and Rafi use all of their dark sorcery to attempt to crush Thor&#39;s identity and take control of his very soul. Under their spell, Thor will have to battle a greater fight than he has ever known, as he struggles to cast off his father and free himself from their chains. But it may already be too late. Gwendolyn, with Alistair, Steffen and Aberthol, ventures deep into the Netherworld, on her quest to find Argon and free him from his magical trap. Reece leads the Legion members as they embark on a near-impossible quest to do what has never been done before: to descend into the depths of the Canyon and find and retrieve the lost Sword. Romulus, armed with his magical cloak, proceeds with his sinister plan to cross into the Ring and destroy the Shield. Will Thor return to himself? Will Gwendolyn find Argon? Will Reece find the Sword? Will Romulus succeed in his plan? Will Kendrick, Erec, Bronson and Godfrey succeed in the face of overwhelming odds? And will Mycoples return? Or will the Ring fall into complete and final destruction?&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In A SKY OF SPELLS (Book #9 in the Sorcerer&#39;s Ring), Thorgrin finally returns to himself and must confront his father once and for all. An epic battle occurs, as two titans face each other, and as Rafi uses his power to summon an army of undead. As the new Queen of the Ring, Gwendolyn uses her powers to unite both MacGils and McClouds and King&#39;s Court slowly comes back to life once again, as they all begin to pick up the pieces. Tirus must be brought to justice, too, and Gwen will have to decide what sort of leader she will be. There is a great conflict amongst Tirus&#39; sons, not all of whom see things the same way, and a struggle for power erupts once again. As all settles down inside the Ring, Thor finds himself summoned to embark on his greatest quest of all: to seek out his mysterious mother in a faraway land and to find out who he really is. With multiple wedding preparations in the air, with Spring returning, King&#39;s Court rebuilding, festivals afoot, peace seems to settle back onto the Ring. But danger lurks in the most unforeseen corners, and all of these characters greatest tribulations might be yet to come.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With its sophisticated world-building and characterization, THE SORCERER&#39;S RING is an epic tale of friends and lovers, of rivals and suitors, of knights and dragons, of intrigues and political machinations, of coming of age, of broken hearts, of deception, ambition and betrayal. It is a tale of honor and courage, of fate and destiny, of sorcery. It is a fantasy that brings us into a world we will never forget, and which will appeal to all ages and genders.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All 17 books in THE SORCERER&#39;S RING are now available!" />
