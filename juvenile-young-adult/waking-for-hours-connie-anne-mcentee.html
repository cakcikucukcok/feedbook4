  <title>Waking for Hours - Connie Anne McEntee</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Seventeen-year-old Bill Miller is a creative, sensitive, and talented teenager who thinks of himself as just a regular guy with ordinary problems. His girlfriend, Shelly, is confused about her feelings for him. His ex-girlfriend, Melody, likes him as just a friend. Truth be told, Bill just wants to find peace. As the summer before his junior year of high school comes to a close, Bill attends a fine arts program at a community college and begins to perceive himself in a new light.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a rather unsuccessful day at camp, Bill meets Julian Jools Garden, who immediately makes him feel better about himself. Jools and Bill find ways to spend time together, starting with a hike in the middle of suburbia that causes Bill to question everything he has ever known about himself. As his friendship with Jools progresses, Bill realizes he is not a straight guy with a girlfriend, but instead a bisexual youth who has fallen in love with Jools, even as Shelly seduces him for the first time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Waking for Hours&lt;/i&gt; shares a teenagers unique coming-of-age journey as he relies on the help of his grandfather and a new friend and unlocks the courage to face the reality about himself, love, and labels.&lt;/i&gt;" />
