  <title>Winning - Lara Deloza</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Who ever said being nice would get you to the top?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Certainly not Alexandra Miles. She isn&amp;#8217;t nice, but she&amp;#8217;s more than skilled at playing the part. She floats through the halls of Spencer High, effortlessly orchestrating the actions of everyone around her, making people bend to her whim without even noticing they&amp;#8217;re doing it. She is the queen of Spencer High&amp;#8212;and it&amp;#8217;s time to make it official.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alexandra has a goal, you see&amp;#8212;Homecoming Queen. Her ambitions are far grander than her small town will allow, but Homecoming is just the first step to achieving total domination. So when peppy, popular Erin Hewett moves to town and seems to have a real shot at the crown, Alexandra has to take action.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With the help of her trusted friend Sam, she devises her most devious plot yet. She&amp;#8217;ll introduce an unexpected third competitor into the mix, one whose meteoric rise&amp;#8212;and devastating fall&amp;#8212;will destroy Erin&amp;#8217;s chances once and for all. Alexandra can run a scheme like this in her sleep. What could possibly go wrong?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lara Deloza&amp;#8217;s crackling depiction of a perpetually two-steps-ahead popular girl makes for a fun, wicked story with a protagonist that readers will love to hate.&lt;/p&gt;" />
