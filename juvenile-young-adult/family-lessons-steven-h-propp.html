  <title>Family Lessons - Steven H. Propp</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Who says it&#39;s easy to raise kids these days?&lt;p&gt;
Certainly not Nana and Papa, the proud grandparentsand definitely not the parents, other grandparents and great-grandparents, and aunts and uncles of 7-year old Deion and his younger cousins Joshua and Donovan.&lt;p&gt;
But &quot;Life is for learning,&quot; and that&#39;s just what takes place: whether it&#39;s while going to the park, playing on the computer, talking a walk, making music, playing football, eating fast food, playing board games, going to the State Fair, or just doing homeworknot to mention celebrating birthdays, and observing holidays such as Valentine&#39;s Day, Easter, Mother&#39;s Day, the 4th of July, Halloween, and Christmas. The lessons of life may involve the miracle of new birth, or the passing away of a loved onebut they are always shared in a gentle and loving way.&lt;p&gt;
Inspired by the real-life adventures, trials, and tribulations of real-life kids, &lt;I&gt;Family Lessons&lt;/I&gt; is a heartfelt celebration of the joy, wonder, and beauty of children, told from the perspective of &quot;Nana&quot; and &quot;Papa Teague&quot;who undoubtedly learn more lessons from their grandchildren than they ever impart to them" />
