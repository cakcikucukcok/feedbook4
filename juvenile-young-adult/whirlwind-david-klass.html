  <title>Whirlwind - David Klass</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;In &lt;i&gt;Firestorm&lt;/i&gt;, the first book of the Caretaker Trilogy, seventeen-year-old Jack Danielson saved the world&#39;s oceans, but at great personal cost -- his parents were killed and everything he knew and believed in was turned upside down. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now Jack has come home to see P.J., his girlfriend and sole remaining touchstone. But she&#39;s missing, and blame falls on Jack. On the run with Gisco, his crafty canine sidekick, Jack is literally caught up in a whirlwind as he travels to the heart of darkness to rescue P.J. -- a journey that will bring him face-to-face with the father of his old nemesis, the colonel, aka the Dark Lord from the future. Jack&#39;s quest becomes all the more complicated as he discovers that the only person who can stop the Dark Lord is another time traveler, the wizard Kidah, who has disappeared in the present. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Book 2 of the Caretaker Trilogy mixes heart-racing adventure with an urgent ecological warning about the fragility of the world&#39;s rain forests and the importance of respect for indigenous peoples. Readers will be drawn into the vortex of the quest -- whether or not they&#39;re familiar with Book 1.&lt;/p&gt;" />
