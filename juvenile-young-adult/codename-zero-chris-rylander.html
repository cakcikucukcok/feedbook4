      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;From Chris Rylander, author of the breakout hit Fourth Stall saga, comes an incredibly funny and clever mash-up of middle grade school story and spy adventure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are places in the world where heroes are born. There are places where brave men and women fight a never-ending battle against evil in order to keep our country and all other countries safe. There are places where the fate of our planet is being decided, even at this very moment, the consequences of which will echo through history.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;None of these places is in North Dakota.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Carson Fender, seventh grader and notorious prankster, knows this. He&amp;#39;s lived in North Dakota for his entire life, going to the same boring school every day, the same boring movie theater every week, the same boring state fair every year. Nothing ever changes, and nothing ever happens. That is, until today. Because today a desperate man hands him a package with a dire set of instructions. And that package is going to lead Carson to discover that there&amp;#39;s a secret government agency operating in his small, quiet North Dakota hometown. And that this agency needs his help.&lt;/p&gt;" />
