  <title>Sometimes I Can’T Talk Well - Julie Bowen</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Growing up is hard, but its even harder when you have a difficult time communicating. As a child with a speech impediment there are moments of fear, self-doubt, and even embarrassment. Other children may laugh and tease and refuse to play with you. Adults may pity you. It can be very hard to share what youre thinking with others. In Sometimes I Cant Talk Well, a little boy shares the hardship of childhood with a speech problem and sheds light on some encouraging information. For instance, did you know that Moses, the man chosen by God to lead his people out of Egypt, had trouble speaking?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With help from the Bible, author Julie Bowen has used wisdom shes accumulated throughout her career as a speech-language pathologist to relate to children with speech problems and help them remember that God made us all just as we need to be to deserve his love and carry out his plan.&lt;/p&gt;" />
