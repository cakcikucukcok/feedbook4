  <title>The Tales of Purfunple - Cj Blandford, Ray Shingler</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Gnat, a funny little purple fly, is having problems at school with a couple of bullies. He meets a big bad bug and asks the large dragonfly to help him get even and settle the score with the bullies. This Dragonfly, Slade, has changed his ways and has pocketed some valuable wisdom along his way. He shares his pearls of wisdom with Gnat and takes him on a magical journey to Purfunple.
The purple predicament of Purfunple has one purple pig prince plotting to rid the world of all nonpurple color, every speck, every drop, with his new robot machine, the OP3 Operation Purple Pulverizer Pixel Geminater. He will rule the world! His new all purple world! Everything is proceeding as planned until Penelope, an unassuming flower heroine armed only with her pearls of wisdom, brings down the purple brick walls.
Gnat finds a true blue friend and gathers a pocket full of shiny new pearls as he watches the story unfold, the same pearls of wisdom your child will pocket along the way. Pearls of wisdom will arm your child with encouraging words that boost their confidence and decision making skills if they are ever picked on.
The Tales of Purfunple is packed full of DIY paper crafts and comes with access to a Web site with more ideas and fun. This story will give you opportunities to start conversations and teach character building skills that will help a backbone grow straight and strong. BE A MENTOR: share a pearl today." />
