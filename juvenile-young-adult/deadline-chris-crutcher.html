  <title>Deadline - Chris Crutcher</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Ben Wolf has big things planned for his senior year. &lt;em&gt;Had&lt;/em&gt; big things planned. Now what he has is some very bad news and only one year left to make his mark on the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;How can a pint-sized, smart-ass seventeen-year-old do &lt;em&gt;anything&lt;/em&gt; significant in the nowheresville of Trout, Idaho? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;First, Ben makes sure that no one else knows what is going on&amp;#8212;not his superstar quarterback brother, Cody, not his parents, not his coach, no one. Next, he decides to become the best 127-pound football player Trout High has ever seen; to give his close-minded civics teacher a daily migraine; and to help the local drunk clean up his act. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And then there&#39;s Dallas Suzuki. Amazingly perfect, fascinating Dallas Suzuki, who may or may not give Ben the time of day. Really, she&#39;s first on the list.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Living with a secret isn&#39;t easy, though, and Ben&#39;s resolve begins to crumble . . . especially when he realizes that he isn&#39;t the only person in Trout with secrets.&lt;/p&gt;" />
