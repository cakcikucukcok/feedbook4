  <title>The Silver Penny - Randall Wright</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Deb figured if he had to clean out Hilde&#39;s stall one more time, he&#39;d bust. He wished he knew the hex for making all that manure disappear.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;  Grandpa said the German folk down in Pennsylvania knew how to do it. But Grandpa could barely recollect the cure for the wanderlust, let alone the more useful hexes.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;  &quot;Well, maybe I&#39;ll just work it out on my own,&quot; Deb told himself.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;A young boy goes on the journey of a lifetime . . . or many lifetimes&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Deb has a bad case of wanderlust. No hex can keep him from yearning for far-off places, and neither can a broken leg. But it can keep him from moving around at all. Deb is so miserable that he even misses doing chores. Nothing cheers him up-not his cousin Tam and especially not that strange boy Bray who&#39;s been hanging about.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The only glimmer of brightness in Deb&#39;s life comes from Grandpa&#39;s lucky silver penny, which keeps mysteriously showing up. Soon its strange powers lead him on a journey that might be just the cure he needs.&lt;/p&gt;" />
