  <title>THE VILLAGE of Hide and SEEK - a Magical Tale of Adventure for Children - Bingham Thoburn Wilson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="On a bright sunny day in the middle of the month of August, a merry group of brightly dressed children were romping upon the green lawn of a country place.&lt;br /&gt;
The old-fashioned stone house, with its wide porch and heavily carved wooden columns green-coated with climbing ivy, rose amid the stately trees of the lawn, until it seemed lost in a bower of shadowy foliage. The low, thatch-roofed out-buildings and long lines of a far-reaching fence, stood glistening in the sunlight, quite in harmony with the polished marble window sills of the great stone mansion.&lt;br /&gt;
Standing in the very centre of the scene, arose the tall, rustic arm of an old-fashioned well-sweep, that raised or lowered a moss-covered, old oak bucket, filled to overflowing and dripping wet with cool, clear water, frequently visited by this frolicking group of merry children both during and after their play.&lt;br /&gt;
As the children rested for a moment beneath the sheltering arms of an old oak tree, they were much surprised to behold the form of a wandering vagabond ambling along the dusty road. His hat was well drawn down over his eyes to avoid the glaring rays of the mid-day sun. Over his shoulder and made fast to the end of a crooked stick, that might have answered as well for a defence as for a staff, hung his sum total of earthly possessions, tied carefully into a small bundle and as carefully hid from view within the folds of a red bandanna handkerchief...&lt;br /&gt;
And so begins the magical adventure to the Village of Hide and Seek. But what does the vagabond have to do with this bunch of happily cavorting children? And, just who is Aunt Twaddles? Well you&amp;rsquo;ll have to download and read the book to find out.&lt;br /&gt;
