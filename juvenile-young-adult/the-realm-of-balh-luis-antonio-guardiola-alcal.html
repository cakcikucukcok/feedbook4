  <title>The Realm Of Balh - Luis Antonio Guardiola Alcalá</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The Four Realms * Volume I * The Realm of Balh
 
The world of Arah is divided into four great realms, all of them under the dominion of the immortal Kleos, supreme god of the world. Lord Deko has held the government of Balh since time immemorial. He commands the dronk army, made up of terrible beasts whose sole mission is to exercise tight control over humans. However, Laros, the capital of Balh, is one of the few cities that remains undiminished in the face of dronk rule. The human race fears for its extinction after centuries of submission to the fearsome generals of Kleos.&lt;br/&gt;
Kurt Brent is a young man who dreams of one day becoming a Knight of Laros. One night, while sleeping, he meets a mysterious man who inexplicably shares his dreams. He will become his teacher and will teach him not only the art of the sword, but also to control the power that is hidden inside his mind.&lt;br/&gt;
Lansa Sarin, a beautiful young woman with long blonde hair and skilled in the handling of the bow, has captivated Kurt’s heart, but the events rush when Siniste, the drake, is sent to Balh by Kleos. Kurt and Lansa will be forced to start a dangerous flight to the capital to escape the ruthless dronks. From then on, they will have to save countless dangers and survive horrible creatures from times long forgotten, but this will only be the beginning of their adventure. A bloody war will soon follow; that in which the fate of the human race will be decided.&lt;br/&gt;" />
