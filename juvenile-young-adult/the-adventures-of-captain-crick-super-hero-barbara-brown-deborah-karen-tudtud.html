  <title>The Adventures of Captain Crick, Super Hero - Barbara Brown, Deborah Karen Tudtud</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Far and long away from here is where we meet Captain Crick&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Captain Crick was the one and only, the greatest and mightiest pirate of all time who traveled the seven seas and rivers everywhere with his mighty crew. They continue to fulfill their task of helping everyone, whenever and wherever they can. 
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Aboard the SS Goody, the Captain gathers his men and tells them the details of their new mission and voyage: to catch as much fish, shrimp, lobster, and crab the ship can carry and deliver them to the people who live along the river. 
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Meanwhile, people back ashore are waiting for the SS Goody to arrive, preparing their empty picnic baskets, barbeque equipment, sauces, dips, and more. 
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Will the Captain accomplish his promise and save the day once more?  
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Sending a message of helpfulness and friendship, The Adventures of Captain Crick, Super Hero is a vibrant book that is the perfect binding tool for parents and children." />
