  <title>CINDERELLA or the Little Glass Slipper - A Fairy Tale - Anon E. Mouse</title>
      <meta name="description" content="ISSN: 2397-9607 Issue 246&lt;br /&gt;
In this 246th issue of the &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Baba Indaba&amp;rsquo;s Children&amp;#39;s Stories&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; series, Baba Indaba narrates the story of &amp;ldquo;&amp;rdquo; also known in some places as &amp;ldquo;the Little Glass Slipper.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
A widower marries for a second time after his first wife passes away. Very soon after the marriage, the new wife&amp;rsquo;s true countenance is displayed, as are those of her two mean-spirited daughters.&lt;br /&gt;
The gentleman&amp;rsquo;s daughter by his first marriage is treated like a housemaid and servant rather than a sister and relegated to the kitchen to sit on a stool along the fireplace. They nickname her Cinderella, or maid of the cinders.&lt;br /&gt;
One day a messenger from the King&amp;rsquo;s court arrives with invitations to the ball. Is it coincidence that the Stepmother and step-sisters forget to extend the invite to Cinderella.&lt;br /&gt;
Nevertheless, Cinderella is put to work making and adjusting the ball gowns of beautiful silks, pressing the pleats, polishing the jewellery and getting them ready for the ball.&lt;br /&gt;
On the day, off they go to the ball leaving Cinderella seated on her stool by the fire wishing she could go as well.&lt;br /&gt;
And then something strange and altogether wonderful happens. A bright blue light appears and shimmers in the kitchen&amp;hellip;&amp;hellip;&amp;hellip;&lt;br /&gt;
What happened next you ask? Did Cinders get to go to the ball or was she whisked away to a far and distant land? Well, you&amp;rsquo;ll just have to download and read the story to find out. Also, be sure to read the story&amp;rsquo;s moral message at the end.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Baba Indaba is a fictitious Zulu storyteller who narrates children&amp;#39;s stories from around the world. Baba Indaba translates as &amp;quot;Father of Stories&amp;quot;.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Each issue also has a &amp;quot;&lt;b&gt;WHERE IN THE WORLD - LOOK IT UP&lt;/b&gt;&amp;quot; section, where young readers are challenged to look up a place on a map somewhere in the world. The place, town or city is relevant to the story. &lt;i&gt;HINT - use Google maps.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
