  <title>River Rapids - Kathy Lee</title>
      <meta name="description" content="River Rapids is a great new story for children aged 8 to 11 and is one of four books in the Mallenford Mysteries series by Kathy Lee. Each book in the series focuses on the residents of Mallenford and the series can be read in any order, with each book featuring different main characters. 
A taste of River Rapids: 
And then I saw the girl. 
She was clinging onto a sort of raft, or maybe a bit of broken fence. Only her head and arms were above the water. She looked absolutely terrified as the river swept her towards me. 
“Mum!” I yelled. 
In another minute it would be too late to do anything. The flood would carry the girl away. 
“Mum! Quick! Help me!” 
Maya and her mum live above their shop, selling health food. But when the river bursts its banks and Mallenford starts to flood, Maya’s life is turned upside-down. Who is the girl on the raft, and what will Maya do when she finds out the horrible truth of the girl’s story?" />
