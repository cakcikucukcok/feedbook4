  <title>The Blue-Haired Boy - Courtney C. Stevens</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Set before the events of Courtney C. Stevens&#39;s debut novel, &lt;em&gt;Faking Normal&lt;/em&gt;, this digital short story focuses on Bodee Lennox, otherwise known as the Kool-Aid Kid.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bodee Lennox has secrets. About where he got the four-inch scar on his leg. About the bruises on his back. About what it&#39;s really like to live in the Lennox household. These are things he doesn&#39;t share with anyone . . . until he meets Gerry, a girl with bright-green hair and a smile the size of Alaska. When Gerry falls out of a bus in Rickman, Tennessee, and lands at Bodee&#39;s feet, she gives Bodee two things he desperately needs: a friend and a chance to leave Rickman behind, even if it&#39;s just for a few hours.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He joins Gerry on her epic bus trip for as far as his money will take him. And by the end of the day, more of Bodee has changed than just the color of his hair.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Epic Reads Impulse is a digital imprint with new releases each month.&lt;/p&gt;" />
