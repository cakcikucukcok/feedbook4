  <title>Myrtle Turtle Can Too! - Juliet Madhoo-Bipa, Gabrielle Misitano</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Children learn to be positive thinkers and enjoy dramatizing roles of animals.;  Gem Nascimento  Theatre Director &amp; Producer; National School of Theatre, Arts &amp; Drama; Publisher of Guyana Where &amp; What. This delightful tale holds a lesson about never doubting the ability of another and the importance of friendship; recommended for every preschool classroom. Dr. Mojisola Bafunso  Executive Director  Committee for Early Childhood Development.  Take a journey with some animals that faced hunger caused by drought. Determined to survive, they decided to search for the magical bul-bul-lu tree. Found in thick undergrowth, the fruits are covered with blinding dust reported to stave off hunger if anyone finds them! They decided to search for it but soon found that Myrtle Turtle was a slowpoke; and they left her behind. Undaunted and encouraged by her best friend Gilbert Giraffe, she finally met up with the others but found that none was successful in picking the fruits. But how, when there was so much difficulty and unkindness? Follow the rejected Myrtle who was determined to help her friends despite everything. Does she overcome obstacles in her way to find this one tree in the forest? Through her kind act, Myrtle taught her friends never to give up, be courageous, cooperative and kind by overcoming obstacles and rejections.  Children will learn early in life that results are rewarded when they try not cry. They are introduced to phonics in the names of familiar animals and are able to repeat common phrases, example, the animals laughed, during &amp; after the reading to keep them focused." />
