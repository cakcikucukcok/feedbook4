  <title>Merely - Cate Davis</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Born in the Kalahari Desert in Africa, Merely the Meerkat is the only pup of her mother, Mernie, who teaches her to keep an open heart, to be kind, and to look for the best in others.
But Merely is cruelly taken from her home and family, along with many other animals, and transported across the ocean to an American zoo where her young life changes forever. This exciting journey of a unique creature with a kind and open heart brings Merely together with a group of memorable characters who become her friends including a polar bear named Sam, a mouse named Fred, a tabby cat called Ruby, and Fanny the singing piglet. She also meets a mysterious villain known only as the Stranger.
Merely tries to find happiness by keeping an open heart, just as her mother had taught her. But will she ever see her family again, or will she spend the rest of her life in the Manhattan Zoo?" />
