  <title>Cold Kiss - Amy Garvey</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;It was a beautiful, warm summer day, the day Danny died.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Suddenly Wren was alone and shattered. In a heartbroken fury, armed with dark incantations and a secret power, Wren decides that what she wants&amp;#8212;what she &lt;em&gt;must&lt;/em&gt; do&amp;#8212;is to bring Danny back. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the Danny who returns is just a shell of the boy Wren fell in love with. His touch is icy; his skin, smooth and stiff as marble; his chest, cruelly silent when Wren rests her head against it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wren must keep Danny a secret, hiding him away, visiting him at night, while her life slowly unravels around her. Then Gabriel DeMarnes transfers to her school, and Wren realizes that somehow, inexplicably, he can sense the powers that lie within her&amp;#8212;and that he knows what she has done. And now Gabriel wants to help make things right.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Wren alone has to undo what she has wrought&amp;#8212;even if it means breaking her heart all over again.&lt;/p&gt;" />
