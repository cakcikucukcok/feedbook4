  <title>The Apothecary - T S Cherry</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Katie Rite&amp;rsquo;s chest is tight. It&amp;#39;s suddenly hard to breathe. The church is oppressive. It&amp;#39;s draining her. It&amp;#39;s ruining her. &amp;quot;I have to get out of here,&amp;quot; she gasps. &amp;quot;I have to get out of here!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She bolts from the church, relieved to smell the fresh air and feel the sun on her face. But something still isn&amp;rsquo;t right. Why did she hear the church doors close a second time behind her? She turns and looks over her shoulder, but there is no one there. Still, she can feel someone watching her; following her.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The death of Katie&amp;rsquo;s mother, Isabella, has changed everything. She needs answers and she believes that Miss Green holds the key to those answers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Katie doesn&amp;rsquo;t care about the rumors that Miss Green is a witch. She only cares that Miss Green has been acting strangely and the woman has known her mother for years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What Katie doesn&amp;rsquo;t know is that there is often a bit of truth to every rumor. Now Katie will find herself caught-up in a world of mythical mystery she never dreamed existed.&lt;/p&gt;" />
