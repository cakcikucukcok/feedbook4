  <title>True Leprechaun Luck - Anita E. Shepherd</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Do you believe in Leprechauns? What about lucky clovers? It&#39;s believed that if you were able to catch a leprechaun on St. Patrick&#39;s Day and keep his lucky clover all day, then the clover would return to the leprechaun as gold. Sound greedy? Well, actually this is what helps keep the luck coming every year on St. Patrick&#39;s Day. The more people believe in the lucky clovers, the more gold for the leprechauns and more luck to give out! But what happens when people stop believing in the true luck of the leprechauns? There is less gold to be stored up each year, which means less luck. If there is no more luck, the leprechaun lose their role in St. Patrick&#39;s Day and could mean the end of them all together. Can Brad and Chad help keep the luck going for one leprechaun who has lost his last piece of gold? Will their belief be enough to save all the true leprechaun luck? It&#39;s another adventure for the Holiday Heroes!" />
