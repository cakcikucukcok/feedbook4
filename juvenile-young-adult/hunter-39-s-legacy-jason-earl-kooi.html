  <title>Hunter&#39;s Legacy - Jason Earl Kooi</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&quot;The demonic howls continued reverberating inside the sphere. The shrill sounds kept raising and lowering in pitch, as though there were more than one kind of animal within that filmy fog. Each time the thing inside the dome roared, the different tones slowly began modifying themselves into one piercing bellow, slicing through the air.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&quot;Hunter grimly whispered, &#39;Don&#39;t watch. This is the part where something really bad happens.&#39; &quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
On the eve of final exams, the remarkably young, yet remarkably talented Hunter is sent out to the uncivilized ends of the universe to disarm an up-and-coming terrorist organization. In the midst of his absence, an unknown alien species descends upon the Universally-Credited Tactics Academy, the most advanced center for training in interstellar warfare, industrial espionage, and technological sciences.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
In the space of a single night, this hostile force takes control of the galaxy&#39;s best kept military secrets. When these creatures uncover information surrounding the source of Hunter&#39;s strength, they stop at nothing to destroy him. Before Hunter can face this new threat, though, he must come to terms with a secret buried deep inside him; a secret that could lead to the destruction of everything and everyone Hunter holds dear." />
