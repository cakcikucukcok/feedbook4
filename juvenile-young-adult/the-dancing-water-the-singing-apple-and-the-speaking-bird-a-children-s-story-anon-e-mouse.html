  <title>THE DANCING WATER, THE SINGING APPLE, AND THE SPEAKING BIRD - A Children’s Story - Anon E. Mouse</title>
      <meta name="description" content="ISSN: 2397-9607 Issue 292&lt;br /&gt;
In this 292nd issue of the &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Baba Indaba&amp;rsquo;s Children&amp;#39;s Stories&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; series, Baba Indaba narrates the story, &amp;ldquo;THE DANCING WATER, THE SINGING APPLE, AND THE SPEAKING BIRD&amp;rdquo;, an Eastern European Fairy Tale.&lt;br /&gt;
An Eastern European King had a habit of going about the streets at night, and listening at the doors to hear what the people said of him. So one night he listened at the door of the house where the three sisters lived, and heard them disputing. The oldest said: &amp;quot;If I were the wife of the royal butler, I could give the whole court to drink out of one glass of water, and there would be some left.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
The second said: &amp;quot;If I were the wife of the keeper of the royal wardrobe, with one piece of cloth I could clothe all the attendants, and have some left.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
But the youngest daughter said: &amp;quot;Were I the king&amp;#39;s wife, I would bear him two children: a son with a sun on his forehead, and a daughter with a moon on her brow.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
The king went back to his palace, and the next morning sent for the sisters, and said to them: &amp;quot;Do not be frightened, but tell me what you said last night.&amp;quot; The oldest told him what she had said, and the king had a glass of water brought, and commanded her to prove her words. She took the glass, and gave all the attendants some water to drink, and still there was some water left. &amp;quot;Bravo!&amp;quot; cried the king, and summoned the butler. &amp;quot;This is your husband.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Now it is your turn,&amp;quot; said the king to the next sister, and commanded a piece of cloth to be brought, and the young girl at once cut out garments for all the attendants, and had some cloth left. &amp;quot;Bravo!&amp;quot; cried the king again, and gave her the keeper of the wardrobe for her husband.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Now it is your turn,&amp;quot; said the king to the youngest. &amp;quot;Please your Majesty, I said that if I were the king&amp;#39;s wife, I would bear him two children: a son with a sun on his forehead, and a daughter with a moon on her brow.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;If that is true,&amp;quot; replied the king, &amp;quot;you shall be my queen; if not, you shall die,&amp;quot; and straightway he married her.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This story recounts what happened after the three marriages took place. Did the youngest give birth to two children, a son with a sun on his forehead, and a daughter with a moon on her brow? And what of the wife of the Royal Butler, and the wife of the Royal Wardrobe keeper? What was the outcomes of their marriages? Did all three live happily ever after, as such stories usually end this way? And what of the King?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
