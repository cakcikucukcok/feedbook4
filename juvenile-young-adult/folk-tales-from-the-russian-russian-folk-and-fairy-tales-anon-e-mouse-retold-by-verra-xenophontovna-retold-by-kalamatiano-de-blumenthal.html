The traveling peasant bard or story teller, and the devoted &amp;quot;nyanya&amp;quot;, the beloved nurse of many a generation, are rapidly dying out, and with them the tales and legends, the last echoes of a nation&amp;#39;s early joys and sufferings, hopes and fears, are passing away.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The student of folk-lore knows that the time has come when haste is needed to catch these vanishing stories and songs of the nation&amp;#39;s youth and to preserve them for the delight of future generations. In sending forth the stories in the present volume, all of which thankfully captured and down in print in this volume. It was the hope of the compiler that they may enable Western children to share with the children of Russia the pleasure of glancing into the magic world of the old Slavic nation.&lt;br /&gt;
