  <title>The Voyage of Noah&#39;s Ark - E.G. Peters</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The Voyage of Noahs Ark
The Voyage of Noahs Ark is the story of Noah as a teenager and his inquisitive search for a
better way of life You will learn of the lifestyle of the men of his time and of Noahs adventure into
the land of the giant people where he will discover a new device called a boat and spend many years
with these people learning how these ships were built.
Not able to return to his own land by the way in which he came, Noah has to devise a plan
that nearly failed to return him to his own homeland. Here he will become wealthy constructing
ships and eventually marry and become the father of three sons
He will accept an order from God to construct an Ark so large his men will swear it cannot
be done. You will find out how the Ark was constructed, how all the animals were loaded into and
caged in only seven days, what caused the enormous flood that would occur and how the Ark and
all the water was lifted off the planet Mars and begin its journey to planet Earth.
Here you will live with all those in the ark as they travel through space and experience the
horror they feel as the Ark hurtles through Earths atmosphere to finally splash down in the Indian
ocean. You will see and learn why Noah thought the Earth was completely covered with water and
why he was sure the water Continued to abate, until the Earth was dry, All a misconception
You will find out where the Ark ran aground and how the Ark was unloaded even though
the entrance door was still under water. Here Noah and his descendents would create a great
civilization that would eventually die out and the archeologists would just now begin to uncover
some astounding facts about this amazing and long lost episode in the life of mankind." />
