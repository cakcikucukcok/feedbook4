  <title>Love Campaign - Liz Levoy</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;b&gt;Love Campaign&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
A Contemporary Romance&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
When Brisk Insurance needs a new marketing campaign and they shortlist both Wonderworks and Imagine Solutions to tender for the job, Allie has the chance to prove herself. She has to go up against Daniel Bowen, a Shark in the marketing world, but she knows enough about him not to be afraid of a little healthy competition.&lt;br /&gt;
Until she meets him and he&amp;rsquo;s not what she expected him to be. Instead of staying away from him and focusing on her work, Allie spends more and more time with him. It looks like Daniel is the one man that changes her ideas about juggling relationships and careers.&lt;br /&gt;
It&amp;rsquo;s just a pity that Daniel has ulterior motives. What catches her off guard, though, is the fact that the womanizer of the century seems to have developed emotions. Through the difficulty of being on opposing teams and both making personal mistakes, they both learn about choices. But all is fair in love and war, right? Or will there be space in their perfect worlds for each other?&lt;br /&gt;
