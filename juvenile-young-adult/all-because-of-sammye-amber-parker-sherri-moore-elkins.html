  <title>All Because of Sammye - Amber Parker, Sherri Moore Elkins</title>
      <meta name="description" content="There are hundreds of situations as to why Foster and Adoption is in our world today.
This book is to help start communication about a topic that can be hard to discuss depending on the situation.
For me- I have been on both sides of the situation. I am adopted. I also have worked as a foster parent and I have also worked with CASA-Court Appointed Special Advocate for Children.
Through all of this I have learned and watched many heartbreaking situations that have helped to create this book and many more to come I hope
This book is to help start the discussion between the child and parent, family, and anyone else curious about Foster and Adoption.
My hope is to help build stronger families through communicating about Foster and Adoption.
My desire is to take the hurt, anger and frustration and make it into a bond stronger than family!
Choosing to love, raise and make an unconditional unwavering commitment to love someone that did not come from your blood and bones is an admirable but daunting task. It will be a tough fight at times but in the end the bond and relationship and loyalty is stronger than any DNA strand.
First, I would like to say that this would not be possible without God because without him- I am impossible.
Last, THANK YOU to all of those who saw the fight worth it and staying beside me while I discovered I was worth fighting for.
Thank you- I love you all!" />
