  <title>Layla the Ladybug - &#39;&#39;Honesty&#39;&#39; - Darlington Johnson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Most kids, including myself, at times are afraid of being honest, because of the fear of the outcome. We may
feel the easy way out is to tell a fib. These is why Layla gives us another example on how kids can handle that
fear, and try to make whatever situation you may be into a better outcome. Not only Layla demonstrates honesty
in this book, she also has shown giving back more while she apologizes. In another words, she went out her way
to add an extra good deed with her apology for telling a fib. In conclusion, Layla feels better about herself, and
she feels less stress. I want to inspire all kids, using the character Layla, the positive feelings you will feel in being
honest. Over come that feeling of fear and be honest. Just smile, and handle a difficult situation with honesty,
and follow it up by demonstrating a good deed.
Darlington Johnson: Layla The LadybugHonesty
Fear how should we handle this feeling before we make the choice to tell a fib?
Fear can sometimes discourage us from telling the truth, because we may not want to deal with the outcome after
telling the truth. Darington would like for all kids to read this book, so they can be encouraged to tell the truth,
and to make better choices. Also by using the character Layla the ladybug, Darlington gave another example on
how to have a positive outcome. She believes it depends on how we handle the emotion of fear from the start.
Over come the feeling of fear, stand tall, and be honest.
Darlington was born on February 21, 1997 in Southfield, Michigan. At the age of seven, Darlington and her
mother moved to Texas. In her spare time she enjoys writing, reading, playing basketball, and drawing. She also
volunteers in her neighborhoods church youth ministry in the pre-school department. Darington appreciates
her mother, father, God-Father Tony, family, friends, and most important and above all, she appreciates our
Heavenly Father.
Today, Darlington wants to encourage as many kids as possible to try to tell the truth, no matter how hard it
can be. We all are human beings, mistakes will be made. Keep in mind when we set our mind to something, we
can eventually achieve it  overcome the Fear." />
