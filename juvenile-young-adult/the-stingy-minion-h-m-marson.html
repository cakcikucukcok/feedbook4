  <title>The Stingy Minion - H. M. Marson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;Educated by her imprisoned hacker father, and dumped on her grandparents doorstep by her distraught mother, sixteen-year-old Elizabeth Carson brings big problems to smalltown Ellisville, Missouri. Rooted in a broken family and conflicted by her own awakening femininity, she fails to recognize that help is all arounda caring community, a musical prodigy named Jereme, and loving grandparents.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;As if family problems were not enough, Elizabeths curious nature finds more trouble. She brings her fathers hacking program, the Stingy Minion, back to life, and soon finds herself staring at a highly classified NSA blog site used by the president of the United States. Trouble escalates to danger when a power hungry investment firm tries to steal the Stingy Minion and threatens her life and the lives of newfound friends.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;In over her head, Elizabeth continues to hack and discovers a plot to attack Irans nuclear development sites. The world is on the verge of nuclear war. With hired thugs on her tail, only time will tell how long she and her friends will remain safe.&lt;/P&gt;" />
