  <title>THE STORY OF THE THREE APPLES - A Children&#39;s Story from 1001 Arabian Nights - Anon E. Mouse, Narrated by Baba Indaba</title>
      <meta name="description" content="ISSN: 2397-9607 Issue 239&lt;br /&gt;
In this 239th issue of the Baba Indaba&amp;rsquo;s Children&amp;#39;s Stories series, Baba Indaba narrates the Arabian Nights story of The Three Apples.&lt;br /&gt;
Once upon a time long, long ago and far, far away the Khaleefeh H&amp;aacute;roon Er-Rasheed said to Jaafar, his Wezeer (Vizier), We will disguise ourselves and go down to-night into the city, and inquire of the affairs of those who we find.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
They find an old fisherman who lamenting (weeping and crying in grief) and quoting verse. He tells them how he fishes everyday and barely catches enough to support his family, let alone sell. The Kaleefeh makes the fisherman an offer. He tells him let us go back to the river and whatever the fisherman catches he will offer him 100 pieces of gold.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The fisherman rejoices all the way to the river and casts his net. After a while he hauls up a chest, locked and heavy. The exchange takes place and the Kaleefeh and his Vizier take the chest back to the palace.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
They lighted the candles, and placed the chest before them, then broke it open. Within they found a basket of palm-leaves sewed up with red worsted (a 4 ply yarn of various blends); and they cut the threads. Opening the parcel they saw within it a piece of carpet, and, lifting up this, they found beneath it an iz&amp;aacute;r (men&amp;#39;s and women&amp;#39;s white garments worn by Muslim people during the Hajj pilgrimage)., and when they had taken up the iz&amp;aacute;r they discovered under it a damsel like molten silver, killed, and cut in pieces.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
And so begins the investigation of the Kaleefeh and his Vizier &amp;ndash; to find the perpetrator of the beautiful maiden&amp;rsquo;s murderer. This investigation will lead them on many adventures across the seas during which time they will hear the story of NOOR-ED-DEEN AND HIS SON, AND OF SHEMS-ED-DEEN AND HIS DAUGHTER.&lt;br /&gt;
But what was the story of Nord-ed-Deen and his son? We invite you to download and read this story of Arabian princes, kings, princesses, palaces and adventures to find the answers.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Baba Indaba is a fictitious Zulu storyteller who narrates children&amp;#39;s stories from around the world. Baba Indaba translates as &amp;quot;Father of Stories&amp;quot;.&lt;br /&gt;
Each issue in the Baba Indaba Children&amp;rsquo;s Stories series has a &amp;quot;WHERE IN THE WORLD - LOOK IT UP&amp;quot; section, where young readers are challenged to look up a place on a map somewhere in the world. The place, town or city is relevant to the story. &lt;i&gt;HINT - use Google maps.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
It is our hope that in looking up these place names using Google Maps, that young people will be able to see the images and read about other peoples and cultures from around the world. Through this, it is also our hope that young people will not only increase their understanding of world geography, but also increase their understanding and tolerance of other people and their cultures.&lt;br /&gt;
