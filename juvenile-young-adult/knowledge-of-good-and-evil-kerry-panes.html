  <title>Knowledge of Good and Evil - Kerry Panes</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Young Arie is a healer who lives in paradise. As she celebrates her ascension into adulthood, Arie is surprised to learn that her parents have arranged marriage for herto a complete stranger. But she feels closed in by her surroundings and has an insatiable need to explore the world. Fortunately, an opportunity to do just that is about to arrive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When beings from another world land on her planet, curiosity takes hold of Arie as she observes the sky-people who are studying her world and the creatures and plants on it. Yearning to travel through the stars and see what lies beyond the boundaries of her world, she slips onto the ship without being noticed, thinking her dreams are about to come true. As she encounters beings who either want to befriend her or kill her, she must learn to cope with their world and understand their culture by communicating through telepathic images. She manages to overcome all-until she meets an ancient foe who seeks to destroy everything she knows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this tale of adventure among the stars, Arie must make the ultimate decision of life or death, fueled with the hope that one day she will somehow find her way home again.&lt;/p&gt;" />
