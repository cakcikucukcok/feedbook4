  <title>Listen to Your Body - Diana Cumberland</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt; If your life becomes a nightmare, making it impossible to smile, listen to your body. Your feelings are a sign from your body, letting you know when something is not right.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;This book contains important messages to empower children to be proactive for their own safety and wellbeing. We cannot always safeguard our children from danger. So it is vital they learn to recognize signals from their bodies so they can keep themselves safe from harm.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt; Listen to your Body communicates the themes of Protective Behaviours: Everyone has a right to feel safe all the time and Nothing is so awful that you cant talk about it with someone.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;The story and illustrations combine effectively to convey these empowering messages in a positive manner. The author has carefully chosen words and pictures to stimulate discussion about safety without robbing children of their innocence.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;The appendix contains activities to help children recognize their own body signals and create their own personal network of people they can trust. &lt;/P&gt;" />
