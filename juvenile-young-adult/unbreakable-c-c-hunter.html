He&#39;s even more&lt;i&gt;...&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;Who is Chase Tallman, the newest member of Shadow Falls? What made him into the sexy, mysterious vampire he is today? And what led him to Della Tsang?&lt;br&gt;Step back in time and unearth the secrets that haunt him. The secret of how he became a vampire-and how he knows so much about being reborn. Secrets about his first love, his family--and what steers him toward Della, the beautiful, complicated girl he just can&#39;t seem to stay away from. The one who makes him want things he thought he&#39;d given up on long ago. &lt;br&gt;It all began with a research study, a palm reader, and a plane crash that sent him on a quest...for a love that&#39;s &lt;i&gt;unbreakable&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;" />
