  <title>Blitz Next Door - Cathy Forde</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Pete has never even heard of Clydebank in Scotland, but when his dad finds a new job at last, Pete finds himself leaving his home in London overnight. There are advantages to his new life, including a massive new bedroom and his first ever garden, complete with a real-life bomb shelter. He&#39;d even be ok with the sound of the girl next door crying all the time -- except that there is no house next door... Pete makes two new friends: Dunny, who knows all about the Second World War, and Beth, the girl next door who somehow seems to come from it. He slowly realises that Beth has returned from the 1940s for a reason. But does Pete have the courage to step into the past to solve a mystery that&#39;s over seventy years old? Critically acclaimed children&#39;s author Cathy Forde presents a vivid adventure story based on the events of the Clydebank Blitz of 1941." />
