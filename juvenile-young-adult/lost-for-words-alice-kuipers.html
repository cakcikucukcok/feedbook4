  <title>Lost for Words - Alice Kuipers</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;My New Year&#39;s resolution: I&#39;m moving on from everything that&#39;s happened. I&#39;m not going to talk about it, think about it, let the memory pounce upon me like a waiting tiger, nothing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;All Sophie wants to do is forget. But it&#39;s not easy now that everything&#39;s changed. The house feels too big, school drags on for too long, lights are too bright, the room spins, and her hands get sweaty for no reason. And she can&#39;t remember why she was ever best friends with Abigail, who is obsessed with parties and boys. Only the new girl, Rosa-Leigh, with her prose poems and utter confidence, might understand. But talking to her seems impossible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lost in memories of the life she once had, Sophie retreats into herself. But there&#39;s only so long she can keep everything bottled up inside before she explodes. Maybe by confronting the tragedy of her past she&#39;ll figure out how to fix her future.&lt;/p&gt;" />
