  <title>Wolfsbane - Gillian Philip</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s tough being the foretold savior of your race. Rory MacGregor, kept a virtual prisoner in his own father&#39;s dun and hunted by the Sithe queen, needs a break now and then--and what better fun than tearing the Veil no one else can tear and escaping to the Otherworld? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In that dangerous Otherworld, Hannah Falconer is as trapped by circumstance as the strange wild Sithe boy whose horse nearly kills her. When Rory tricks her into crossing the Veil and entering his world, she&#39;s sure it can&#39;t be any worse than her usual home life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, Seth MacGregor is fighting to keep his clan safe from the malevolent queen Kate. When an attack comes after years of stalemate, he is shocked to discover who is leading it...and who else is conspiring against him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Wolfsbane, &lt;/i&gt;the third novel in Gillian Philip&#39;s Rebel Angels series is enthralling and suspenseful, with a range of characters appealing to every age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the Publisher&#39;s request, this title is being sold without Digital Rights Management Software (DRM) applied.&lt;/p&gt;" />
