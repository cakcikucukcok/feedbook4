  <title>The Things Owen Wrote - Jessica Scott Kerrin</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Owen has always done well, even without trying that hard. He gets As in school, is an avid photographer and knows he can count on his family&amp;#8217;s support. But then Owen makes a mistake. A big one. And now he must face his fear of disappointing his entire family. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A last-minute trip to Iceland, just Owen and his granddad, seems like the perfect way out. For Owen&amp;#8217;s granddad, the trip is about paying tribute to a friend with Icelandic roots.  But Owen has a more urgent reason for going: he must get back the notebook his granddad accidentally sent to the Iceland archive. He can&amp;#8217;t let anyone read the things he wrote in it!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The pair gets on a plane, excited to leave their prairie town for a country of lava fields, glaciers and geysers. However, as they explore Iceland, the plan to recover Owen&amp;#8217;s notebook starts to spiral out of control. Why does Owen&amp;#8217;s granddad seem so confused and forgetful? And can Owen really hide the truth of what&amp;#8217;s in his notebook? &lt;/p&gt;" />
