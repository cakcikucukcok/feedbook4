  <title>The Wish Granter - C. J. Redwine</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;An epic, romantic, and action-packed fantasy inspired by the tale of Rumpelstiltskin, about a bastard princess who must take on an evil fae to save her brother&amp;#8217;s soul, from C. J. Redwine, the &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; bestselling author of &lt;em&gt;The Shadow Queen&lt;/em&gt;. Perfect for fans of &lt;em&gt;Graceling&lt;/em&gt; and the Lunar Chronicles. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The world has turned upside down for Thad and Ari Glavan, the bastard twins of S&amp;#250;ndraille&amp;#8217;s king. Their mother was murdered. The royal family died mysteriously. And now Thad sits on the throne of a kingdom whose streets are suddenly overrun with violence he can&amp;#8217;t stop.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Growing up ignored by the nobility, Ari never wanted to be a proper princess. And when Thad suddenly starts training Ari to take his place, she realizes that her brother&amp;#8217;s ascension to the throne wasn&amp;#8217;t fate. It was the work of a Wish Granter named Alistair Teague who tricked Thad into wishing away both the safety of his people and his soul in exchange for the crown. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;So Ari recruits the help of Thad&amp;#8217;s enigmatic new weapons master, Sebastian Vaughn, to teach her how to fight Teague. With secret ties to Teague&amp;#8217;s criminal empire, Sebastian might just hold the key to discovering Alistair&amp;#8217;s weaknesses, saving Ari&amp;#8217;s brother&amp;#8212;and herself. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But Teague is ruthless and more than ready to destroy anyone who dares stand in his way&amp;#8212;and now he has his sights set on the princess. And if Ari can&amp;#8217;t outwit him, she&amp;#8217;ll lose Sebastian, her brother&amp;#8230;and her soul.&lt;/p&gt;" />
