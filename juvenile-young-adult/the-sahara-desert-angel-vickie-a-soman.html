dream. People wore masks, talked in pidgin English, and performed witchcrafts.

dusk. I took these as mere storiesfictitious legendsuntil now!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A legend said that the Naked Devil Dancera barely clothed geniewore different
face masks and only a Speedo-type suit covering his private body parts. Often, his
arrival was dramatic, with black birds, such as vultures and crows, flying overhead.
In many cultures, these were signs of demons.&lt;/p&gt;

just in Heaven; theyre everywhere! In The Sahara Desert Angelthe second book
