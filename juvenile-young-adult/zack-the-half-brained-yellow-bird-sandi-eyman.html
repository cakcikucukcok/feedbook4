  <title>Zack, the Half-Brained Yellow Bird - Sandi Eyman</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Zack Zuzak has a self-image problem. Not only is he bothered by the stigma of being in the Yellow Bird reading level, hes convinced he has only half a brain--the right side. Together with his friends, Lin and Carlos, they consider themselves the class misfits. Zack suspects they dont have a whole brain between the three of them. What other reason could there be that makes the planning of a science fair project so difficult?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When inspiration smacks Zack on the head, the boys are motivated to plan and construct an offbeat, creative science project. However, the smartest kid in the class, Richard Martin Malone, doesnt appreciate their efforts. Richard feels strongly the praise of the boys project is not justified. After all, these dummy guys rarely carry through on any major assignment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What happens next is an escalation from harsh words to confrontation and a swift trip to the principals office. How will the principal deal with the unkind language, hurt feelings, and misunderstandings between Richard and the boys?&lt;/p&gt;" />
