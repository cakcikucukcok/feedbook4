  <title>Made of Stars - Kelley York</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Made of Stars by Kelley York&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When eighteen-year-old Hunter Jackson and his half sister, Ashlin, return to their dad&#39;s for the first winter in years, they expect everything to be just like the warmer months they&#39;d spent there as kids. And it is--at first. But Chance, the charismatic and adventurous boy who made their summers epic, is harboring deep secrets. Secrets that are quickly spiraling into something else entirely. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The reason they&#39;ve never met Chance&#39;s parents or seen his home is becoming clearer. And what the siblings used to think of as Chance&#39;s quirks--the outrageous stories, his clinginess, his dangerous impulsiveness--are now warning signs that something is seriously off. &lt;br&gt;Then someone turns up with a bullet to the head, and all eyes shift to Chance&#39;s family. Hunter and Ashlin know Chance is innocent...they just have to prove it. But how can they protect the boy they both love when they can&#39;t trust a word Chance says?&lt;/p&gt;" />
