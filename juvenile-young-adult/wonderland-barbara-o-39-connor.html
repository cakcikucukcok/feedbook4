Her flighty mother has uprooted them again to another new home and taken a job as a housekeeper for the Tully family. Mavis wants this home to be permanent--which means finding herself a best friend.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rose Tully is a worrier who feels like she doesn&#39;t quite fit in with the other girls in her neighborhood. Her closest friend is Mr. Duffy, but he hasn&#39;t been himself since his dog died. Rose may have to break a few of her mother&#39;s many rules to help Mr. Duffy--and find someone who really understands her.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Henry has run away from home, but he craves kindness and comfort--and doesn&#39;t know where to look for them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; When Mavis and Rose hatch a scheme to find Mr. Duffy a new dog, their lives and Henry&#39;s intersect--and they all come to find friendship in places they never expected.&lt;/p&gt;" />
