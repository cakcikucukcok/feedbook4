      <meta name="description" content="It is rather poignant that this collection of Folk and Fairy Tales from the Flanders region of Belgium was published in 1918, for in the closing stage of the Great War I don&amp;rsquo;t think there were many, soldiers and civilians living in Flanders, who in 1918 had the fantasy world of folk and fairy tales foremost in mind.&lt;br /&gt;

Ups And Downs&lt;br /&gt;
The Three Monkeys&lt;br /&gt;
How The Goldfinch Got His Colours&lt;br /&gt;

&amp;ldquo;This handsome and well-illustrated book is one of the most attractive we have seen this season.

&amp;ldquo;There are delightful stories; even more attractive than the letterpress are M. de Bossch&amp;egrave;re&amp;rsquo;s illustrations. Conceived with inexhaustible fancy, full of quaint detail, and set down with a fascinating na&amp;iuml;vet&amp;eacute; they embody the characters and scenes of the tales with a fullness of particularism that should provide endless entertainment to youthful readers.
