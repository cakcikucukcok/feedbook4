  <title>Even If the Sky Falls - Mia Garcia</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;One midsummer night. Two strangers. Three rules: No real names. No baggage. No phones. A whirlwind twenty-four-hour romance about discovering what it means to feel alive in the face of one of life&amp;#8217;s greatest dangers: love.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Who would you be if you had one night to be anyone you want?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Volunteering in New Orleans was supposed to be a change, an escape from the total mess Julie left at home and from her brother&amp;#8217;s losing battle with PTSD. But building houses surrounded by her super-clingy team leader and her way-too-chipper companions has Julie feeling more trapped than ever. And she&amp;#8217;s had enough.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a moment of daring, Julie runs away, straight into the glitter, costumes, and chaos of the Mid-Summer Mardi Gras parade&amp;#8212;and instantly connects with Miles, an utterly irresistible musician with a captivating smile and a complicated story of his own. And for once, Julie isn&amp;#8217;t looking back. Together Julie and Miles decide to forget their problems and live this one night in the here and now. Wandering the night, they dance on roofs, indulge in beignets, share secrets and ghost stories under the stars, and fall in love. But when a Category Two hurricane changes course and heads straight for NOLA, their adventure takes an unexpected turn. And, suddenly, pretending everything is fine is no longer an option.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Richly evocative to the heart-racing end, &lt;em&gt;Even If the Sky Falls&lt;/em&gt; is a swoon-worthy debut to indulge in to the very last note.&lt;/p&gt;" />
