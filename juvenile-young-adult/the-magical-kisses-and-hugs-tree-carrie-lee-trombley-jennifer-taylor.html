      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;Bobby sets out on a journey to find &lt;b&gt;The Magical Kisses and Hugs Tree&lt;/b&gt;.  He wants to get some magical kisses and hugs for his mother.  He thinks this will show his mother how much he loves her.  On his journey, he meets Tommy the turtle and Hoppy a frog.  These two have problems of their own.  Bobby is very helpful in helping them to overcome their problems by using some of his mother&#39;s techniques that have helped him in the past.  After Bobby&#39;s journey is completed, he goes to give his mother the necklace he had made out of the X&#39;s and O&#39;s from the magical tree, that&#39;s when he discovers that the necklace had disappeared.  He learns later on when the sun goes down why it disappeared.  Bobby also learns a lesson, that no gift is greater than love itself." />
