  <title>THE MISSING PRINCE - The Adventures of Boy in the land of Zum - G. E. Farrow</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The King of Zum passes away and the Crown Prince and his wife, the Princess can&amp;rsquo;t be found anywhere in the kingdom? Is there something sinister afoot, or have they run away?&lt;br /&gt;
The people of Zum didn&amp;rsquo;t know what to do and many were seen walking through the streets wringing their hands and behaving most strangely, for you see, Zum had never not had a monarch.&lt;br /&gt;
Far away in London, Boy (for that is how everyone calls him) has stayed up late because he and his family are going on a journey. After the sun has gone and the Gaslighter had done his rounds and lit all the streetlights, boy was taken to a waiting carriage. Through the eerily lit streets the horses clipped and clopped towards Kings Cross station. Very soon he was ensconced in a plush leather window seat and the train was steaming its way through North London, through the suburbs and into the moonlit country side&amp;hellip;..&lt;br /&gt;
He awoke in an unfamiliar room and was told they were in Scarborough. Boy spent the day on the beach making sandcastles and even laughed at the play staged by the Pierrot Theatre company.&lt;br /&gt;
At the end of the day, thoroughly tired out, he went to bed right after dinner and was gazing through the window when the moon started moving closer and closer. When it was close enough he could see Pierrot from the Theatre Company sitting astride the yellowy-golden orb.&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;I have an invitation for you,&amp;rdquo; Pierrot said to Boy.&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;For me!?&amp;rdquo; said an incredulous Boy?&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Yes for you. Now come on, hop on,&amp;rdquo; said Pierrot holding out a hand &amp;ldquo;we don&amp;rsquo;t want to be late.&lt;br /&gt;
Taking Pierrot&amp;rsquo;s hand Boy stepped from the window sill onto the moon.&lt;br /&gt;
And so began Boy&amp;rsquo;s moonlit adventures with Pierrot to the land of Zum.&lt;br /&gt;
Will Boy be the one who finds the lost Prince and Princess? Just where could they be? What adventures will Boy have and where are they going to stay? Afterall the moon disappears at the end of each day?&lt;br /&gt;
