  <title>Crossing Over - Royal Grandison</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Well hello saints! My Name is Royal Grandison. I truly want to honor God and the precious lamb Jesus Christ, king of all kings, for helping me make this book. On October 10th, 2013, my mother passed away from heart failure. Im not looking for any sympathy. I just want to tell the world what God did for me. After my mom passed away, the pride
that I once had was destroying me on the inside. I wanted to cry and talk to people I trusted, but the pride that was in
me, wouldnt let me. I was angry and ambitious, with a lot of hurt in me. All I kept on saying every day is, Im going to be successful. I was so determined to keep the promise that I made to my mother. While going through all this I still
continued to draw; drawing was and still is my escape route from tough times in my life. One night, I was drawing a piece I named, Who Paved The Way. As I was drawing, I started to think about everything in my life; I could no longer hold the weight I carried. I suddenly began to cry. A few weeks later, I decided to go to church. During the service, the Lord delivered me. I cried out to God for the ??irst time, and my life was never the same. God will take us all through a breaking process. If you want to use an egg you must break it. And thats what the Lord did. He took me through a breaking process.
It wasnt easy. A lot of changes occurred in my life that I wasnt comfortable with. But at the end of that phase God took me through, I saw his glory unfold. Now Im so in love with Jesus! I have direction and guidance now. Dont get me wrong. Im far from perfect, but Gods mercy is greater than all my  laws. His grace, mercy and unconditional love for us all is like no other. How can we not praise our God!?! Jesus can turn any situation around, just like what He did in my life. Although
He is still ??ixing some things in me. But over time God will do miraculous changes in my life and in your lives too. Yes, He can do it in a twinkling of an eye, but He wants to test our faith in Him. Those who serve the Lord will be challenged by Him some point in their lives. He wants to see how much we love and trust in Him. Will our prayers decrease when we experience suffering or will our prayers increase? What WE, as the people of the church, must understand is that our suffering has a reward. Peter 5:10 says, And after you have suffered a little while, the God of all grace, who has called
you to his eternal glory in Christ, will Himself restore, con??irm, strengthen, and establish you. God has a plan for us all. The reason why we suffer is because Hes molding us all into something MEGA! You may not understand it now, but just know, if you trust Him, He will show Himself mighty in your life! God foreknew you. You have great purpose, beyond what you know, for both the Kingdom of Heaven and this world!" />
