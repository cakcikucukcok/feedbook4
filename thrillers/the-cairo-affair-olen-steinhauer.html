Minutes after she confesses to her husband, a mid-level diplomat at the American embassy in Hungary, that she had an affair while they were in Cairo, he is shot in the head and killed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stan Bertolli, a Cairo-based CIA agent, has fielded his share of midnight calls. But his heart skips a beat when he hears the voice of the only woman he ever truly loved, calling to ask why her husband has been assassinated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Omar Halawi has worked in Egyptian intelligence for years, and he knows how to play the game. Foreign agents pass him occasional information, he returns the favor, and everyone&#39;s happy. But the murder of a diplomat in Hungary has ripples all the way to Cairo, and Omar must follow the fall-out wherever it leads.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;American analyst Jibril Aziz knows more about Stumbler, a covert operation rejected by the CIA, than anyone. So when it appears someone else has obtained a copy of the blueprints, Jibril alone knows the danger it represents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As these players converge in Cairo in the&lt;i&gt; New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestseller, &lt;i&gt;The Cairo Affair&lt;/i&gt;, Olen Steinhauer&#39;s masterful manipulations slowly unveil a portrait of a marriage, a jigsaw puzzle of loyalty and betrayal, against a dangerous world of political games where allegiances are never clear and outcomes are never guaranteed.&lt;/p&gt;" />
