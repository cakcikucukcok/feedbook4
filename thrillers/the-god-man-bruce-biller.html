  <title>The God-Man - Bruce Biller</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Christians worldwide agree there is coming a moment when the true church, comprised of faithful followers of Christ, will be suddenly caught up, snatched away, raptured--to be forever with their Lord.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But what will you do, how will you react, if this disappearance does not occur before Antichrists Great Tribulation begins? Are we prepared and equipped to take a stand in a culture, a new world order, that will be passionately opposed to our beliefs?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The god-man: seed of Satan&lt;/em&gt; is the first in a two-part, pre-wrath rapture thriller that tells the riveting story of the rise of the treacherous Antichrist, the god-man who will come to prominence during the seventieth week of Daniel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Romiti and his false prophet, Laroque, implement their ambitious plot to rule a global empire, their plans are obstructed by a series of worldwide disasters--war, famine and disease. Much to the surprise of some, the church finds itself a reluctant witness to apocalyptic events that were to be studied--not experienced!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sticks, an evangelical pastor in Mississippi, and Uri, the pastor of a messianic congregation in Jerusalem, have carefully prepared their congregations for a rapture that occurs within the seventieth week of Daniel. Led by these activist pastors and a host of others like them, their congregations boldly engage a hostile global community as the God-fearers courageously live out the gospel in ways that are reminiscent of the early church.&lt;/p&gt;" />
