A car driven by FBI agents tailing a suspicious vehicle is mysteriously rendered immobile in San Francisco. The body of a Chinese agent is found floating miles from the Golden Gate Bridge after being fed to sharks.

As enemy operatives plan a two pronged attack that will disarm the American military and release a deadly toxin killing hundreds of thousands of civilians, Hatfield and Dover race to locate this new Ground Zero and save an unsuspecting county.&lt;/p&gt;" />
