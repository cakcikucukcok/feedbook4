  <title>Powerless - Richard L. Smith</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Life is business as usual for two families in very different parts of the United States. Peter Dexter and his wife, Judy, raise a family and run a successful farm in North Dakota, while Dan and Nora Justin do their best to keep their kids in line in California. The families have been friends for years and face different challenges when a Corona Mass Ejection from the sun cuts off all electrical power across the nation.&lt;/p&gt;
The loss of power in America generates chaos throughout the country. Electricity? Gone. Mass transit? Out of service. Emergency services? Unavailable. The United States is cast into a new Dark Age, and the Dexter and Justin families struggle to survive despite danger and difficulty. Meanwhile in a distant land, enemy forces plot revenge. Radical Islamic terrorists see the power outage as a divine gift. Now, they have their chance to destroy America and replace it with an Islamic government.&lt;/p&gt;
Threatening the use of atom bombs, the terrorists try to gain control of the weakened American government. They strive to establish a caliphate on American soil, while civilians are busy avoiding violence and food shortages. Is there any hope for our powerless country? As the two families struggle to survive, a teenager will courageously fight to save the lives of thousands and become the object of a jihad." />
