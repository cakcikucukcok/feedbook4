  <title>In Harm&#39;s Way (Mills &amp; Boon Vintage Intrigue) - Lyn Stone</title>
      <meta name="description" content="
        &lt;p&gt;HE DIDN&#39;T LOOK MUCH LIKE A DETECTIVE….&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Maybe it was the whole Southern comfort thing–the sinfully rich accent, that lazy smile, his heated touch, kindness that nearly disarmed her. But Robin Andrews knew better than to trust a man…especially this one. Did Detective Mitch Winton really have her best interest in mind? Or was he just toying with his prime suspect?&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;The cosmopolitan beauty hadn&#39;t killed anyone. Mitch would stake his badge on it–and, in fact, he did. Because he was going above and beyond the call of duty to figure out who had killed Robin&#39;s estranged husband and why the killer was suddenly after her. But it wasn&#39;t his badge he was worried about losing…it was his heart.&lt;/p&gt;
