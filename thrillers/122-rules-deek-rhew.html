  <title>122 Rules - Deek Rhew</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Law student Monica Sable is in trouble; &amp;ldquo;In the wrong place, at the wrong time, overhearing the wrong conversation&amp;rdquo;, her entire world is about to turn upside down.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Using his mastery of the 122 Rules of Psychology, government assassin Sam Bradford hunts down everyone The Agency sends him to find and eliminate them. Just as he has his rifle scope focused on his latest victim, Monica Sable, a SoCal girl somehow entangled with the mob, his long-dormant conscience reappears for a final performance--one last-ditch effort to save the sinking ship of Sam&amp;#39;s soul. He&amp;#39;s killed innocents before but stalls on pulling the trigger this time.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;When Monica escapes his crosshairs and fumbles her way across the country in a fast paced, desperate attempt to elude capture, Sam gives chase. But he&amp;#39;s not the only one after her. Ruthless mob hitmen,&amp;nbsp; froth like bloodhounds and nip at Monica&amp;#39;s heels.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In his black-and-white world, Sam Bradford--former Marine turned government tool--finally sees a speck of gray. He has always followed orders without question, but his latest assignment threatens to disrupt the precision of his universe and may either sever or redeem his last remaining sliver of humanity.&amp;nbsp; Now Sam is faced with a choice: turn his back on the rules and jeopardize his way of life by helping her, or join the pack and rip her to shreds.&lt;/p&gt;" />
