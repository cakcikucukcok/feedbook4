  <title>Paradigm Shift - Harry S. Franklin</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Thirty-five-year-old Hank Foster, a former Special Forces soldier still reeling over the loss of his leg in combat, is recruited into a clandestine organization dedicated to attacking religious institutions. Impatient with the movement&#39;s slow progress, Hank subverts the powerful organization and uses their vast network to perpetrate a hoax he feels will rock the world and push the Iconoclast organization&#39;s agenda into the spotlight. &lt;p&gt;The hoax succeeds beyond his wildest dreams and sets into motion a chain of events that bring a real extraterrestrial presence into the open. Earth is rocked by global catastrophe on a level never before imagined, and humanity is confronted by the prospect of alien invasion. Hank discovers a conspiracy as old as time itself. He learns he is responsible for the calamity facing humanity, and what&#39;s more, he learns he is the one man capable of exposing the truth that may lead to mankind&#39;s salvation.&lt;p&gt;On its exterior, &lt;i&gt;Paradigm Shift&lt;/i&gt; engages the reader with a visual, action-packed, Hollywood-styled blockbuster, but on a deeper, psychological level, the reader is taken along the hero&#39;s mythic journey to ultimately confront the true nature of humanity." />
