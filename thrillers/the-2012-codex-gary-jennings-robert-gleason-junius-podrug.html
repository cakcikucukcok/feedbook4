  <title>The 2012 Codex - Gary Jennings, Robert Gleason, Junius Podrug</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;In the arid canyonlands of Mexico the race is on for the ultimate end-of-the-world codex--the final 1000-year-old prophesy of the god-king, Quetzalcoatl, who ruled Mexico 1000 years ago. Rita Critchlow and Cooper Jones hunt for that sacred codex in those scorching desert canyons, while 500 years ago, Pacal, a young slave-scholar, sets out on the same deadly quest.  He too must find those apocalyptic writings, knowing that his era--the Age of the Aztecs--may well come to an end if he does not find them.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For Pacal, the End-Time is at hand.  Montezuma has built a vast empire based in what will one day be Mexico City.  Now however he faces war, disastrous drought, death-cult priests, who rip the hearts out of thousands of people atop their pyramids . . . and the arrival of red-bearded horse-borne conquistador, bearing preternaturally powerful weapons and catastrophic plagues, sowing pandemic death wherever he goes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;America&#39;s leaders are also staring into an apocalyptic abyss.  Their own time mirrors that of Quetzacoatl&#39;s and the Aztec&#39;s in shocking detail. Convinced that Quetzalcoatl&#39;s codex holds the key to humanity&#39;s survival--that he is warning them of a global, planet-killing threat--the two women battle broiling desert canyons and drug-cartel warlords to track it down and decipher it.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Moreover, earlier glimpses of his prophesy foreshadow uncanny similarities to those of John&#39;s Book of Revelation.  Are Quetzalcoatl&#39;s and &lt;i&gt;Revelation&lt;/i&gt;&#39;s prophesies one and the same?  Can they crack the 2012 code and save their world from their deadly fate?  The countdown is on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the Publisher&#39;s request, this title is being sold without Digital Rights Management Software (DRM) applied.&lt;/p&gt;" />
