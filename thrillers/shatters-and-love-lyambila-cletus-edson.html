  <title>Shatters and Love - Lyambila Cletus Edson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Micker is in love with Julienne, a beautiful girl who could win a beauty contest if she ever tried but is never interested in exploiting her own beauty. 
Most men want girls to fool around with but when it comes to Julienne, they want a lifelong partner. She comes from a wealthy family but that has never diluted her decency. 
Her falling in love with a man from a middle class family is a bitter pill to swallow for admirers in her social class.With the reigning impunity, some of the admirers do all they can to kill the affair and end up doing something very painful. 
He loses too much and the culprits have to pay in spite of the risk of immense uncertainty in life for his dependant, part of the price to pay. He has to take risks with the hope of protecting himself and concealing everything from everyone especially the law enforcers he had never trusted but what about his inner circle? He later discovers the existence of a new dependant which further complicates matters." />
