  <title>Independence Day - Ben Coes</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Dewey Andreas is back...and the clock is ticking!&lt;/i&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cloud, a high-level Russian hacker, perhaps the best in the world, has acquired a nuclear weapon. It&#39;s an older bomb from the USSR&#39;s Cold War arsenal with the power to devastate a major city. Fueled by a dark and personal vendetta, Cloud has put it onto an anonymous trawler, piloted by jihadists, headed straight to America. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dewey Andreas, former Delta working as an agent for the C.I.A., is still drowning in grief after the tragic murder of his fiancée. Dewey has lost his focus, his edge, and the confidence of his superiors. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Learning of the missing loose nuke and picking up chatter about an impending terrorist attack on American shores, the best and most talented C.I.A. agents are now chasing both Cloud and the bomb. Acting on credible intel, two highly trained teams are sent into Russia in a two-pronged mission to grab Cloud. But it&#39;s a trap, and now America&#39;s last hope of stopping the bomb is an unofficial agent gone rogue-Dewey Andreas. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With only three days left, Dewey Andreas must find the elusive Cloud. To do so, Dewey will risk everything to find the most dangerous and skilled enemy he&#39;s yet faced. For if he fails, American will suffer its most deadly terrorist attack on the Fourth of July-&lt;i&gt;Independence Day&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;" />
