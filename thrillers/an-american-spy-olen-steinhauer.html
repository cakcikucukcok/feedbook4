  <title>An American Spy - Olen Steinhauer</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;In Olen Steinhauer&#39;s bestseller &lt;i&gt;The Tourist&lt;/i&gt;, reluctant CIA agent Milo Weaver uncovered a conspiracy linking the Chinese government to the highest reaches of the American intelligence community, including his own Department of Tourism---the most clandestine department in the Company. The shocking blowback arrived in the Hammett Award--winning &lt;i&gt;The Nearest Exit&lt;/i&gt; when the Department of Tourism was almost completely wiped out as the result of an even more insidious plot.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Following on the heels of these two spectacular novels comes &lt;i&gt;An American Spy&lt;/i&gt;, Olen Steinhauer&#39;s most stunning thriller yet. With only a handful of &quot;tourists&quot;--CIA-trained assassins--left, Weaver would like to move on and use this as an opportunity to regain a normal life, a life focused on his family. His former boss in the CIA, Alan Drummond, can&#39;t let it go. When Alan uses one of Milo&#39;s compromised aliases to travel to London and then disappears, calling all kinds of attention to his actions, Milo can&#39;t help but go in search of him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Worse still, it&#39;s beginning to look as if Tourism&#39;s enemies are gearing up for a final, fatal blow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With &lt;i&gt;An American Spy&lt;/i&gt;, Olen Steinhauer, by far the best espionage writer in a generation, delivers a searing international thriller that will settle once and for all who is pulling the strings and who is being played.&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;An American Spy&lt;/i&gt; is one of &lt;i&gt;The New York Times&lt;/i&gt; Notable Books of 2012.&lt;/p&gt;" />
