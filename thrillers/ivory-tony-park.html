&lt;b&gt;Ivory&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Alex Tremain is a pirate in trouble. The two women in his life &amp;ndash; one of them his financial adviser, the other his diesel mechanic &amp;ndash; have left him. He&amp;rsquo;s facing a mounting tide of debts and his crew of modern-day buccaneers, a multi-national band of ex-military cutthroats, are getting restless.&lt;br /&gt;
They don&amp;rsquo;t all share his dream of going legit, but what Alex really wants is to re-open the five-star resort hotel which once belonged to his Portuguese mother and English father on the Island of Dreams, off the coast of Mozambique.&lt;br /&gt;
A chance raid on a wildlife smugglers&amp;rsquo; ship sets the Chinese triads after him and, to add to his woes, corporate lawyer Jane Humphries lands, literally, in his lap.&lt;br /&gt;
Another woman&amp;rsquo;s the last thing Captain Tremain needs right now &amp;ndash; especially one whose lover is a ruthless shipping magnate backed up by a deadly bunch of contract killers.&lt;br /&gt;
What Alex really needs is one last, big heist &amp;ndash; something valuable enough to fulfil his dreams and set him and his men up for life.&lt;br /&gt;
When the South African government makes a controversial decision to reinstitute the culling of elephants in its national parks, Alex finds the answer to his prayers, but at what cost?" />
