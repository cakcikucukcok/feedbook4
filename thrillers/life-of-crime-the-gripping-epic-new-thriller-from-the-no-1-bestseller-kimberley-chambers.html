          &lt;em&gt;Sometimes crime does pay, but at what price?&lt;/em&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;h2&gt;**The No.1 &lt;em&gt;Sunday Times&lt;/em&gt; bestseller**&lt;/h2&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;Some people are made for a life of crime&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Dragged up on a council estate, Jason Rampling was determined to change his lot. Jason’s a chancer, shameless with his good looks and his gift for earning a few quid. Life is easy when the money rolls in.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;Some people are ruined by it&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Melissa thought she’d struck gold marrying Jason. Being on his arm meant she was finally a someone. But there’s no glamour in waiting for your husband to come home, or waiting for a knock on the door. Melissa made her bed the day she made her vows – will she lie in it without a fight?&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;Some would kill for it&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;After a stretch inside Jason wants to pull off just one last job, the biggest of all, it could solve all of their problems. But this is a game that could cost them everything . . .&lt;/p&gt;
