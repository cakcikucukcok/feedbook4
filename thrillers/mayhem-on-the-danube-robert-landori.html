Ali plans to weaponize the virus in bulk, disguised as surgical glue, at a Hungarian facility, but first needs a vaccine to protect the True Believers against this deadly virus.
He learns that the Canadian scientist, Jason Moscovitch, is feverishly working on such a vaccine. Ali recruits an Al Qaeda Snatch Team, composed of Iraqi, Bosnian and Jordanian elements, who kidnap the man. When the scientist refuses to work for the extremists the team kidnaps his mother as well.

To succeed, he must first penetrate the unbelievably complex web of Islamic Factionalists involved in the case and then overcome European indifference to the growing menace of international terrorism.
