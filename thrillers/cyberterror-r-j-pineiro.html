  <title>Cyberterror - R. J. Pineiro</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Computers increase the flow of natural gas to the San Antonio, Texas, distribution center increasing the pressure, triggering multiple leaks which result in massive explosions. The death toll is in the thousands, ten times the number of injured and homeless.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Tom Graham has spent twenty years as America&#39;s top counterterrorist operative. But this attack was something neither Graham nor America were prepared for. An attack via computer, and suddenly a new word enters the American mainstream, cyberterror. Enlisting the aid of the FBI&#39;s Karen Frost, a special agent who has never played by the rules, and Michael Patrick Ryan, Stanford computer whiz, Graham tracks one of the hackers to an address in Florida. The new government Agency, the Counter Cyberterrorism Team, kicks in the door, only to find the booby-trapped corpse of a computer science professor. The explosion takes out two CCT agents.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Meanwhile, a mysterious terrorist, Kulzak, is on to his next target in America. But the apparently random strikes are just a cover to divert attention from his true mission. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Suddenly, Graham, Frost, and Ryan find themselves at the center of a war for the survival of our nation. A war that will force them to draw on their combined experiences to fight and stop an enemy that is as formidable as he is ruthless, as deadly as he is brilliant-an enemy determined to unleash a wave of destruction on America.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;At the Publisher&#39;s request, this title is being sold without Digital Rights Management Software (DRM) applied.&lt;/p&gt;" />
