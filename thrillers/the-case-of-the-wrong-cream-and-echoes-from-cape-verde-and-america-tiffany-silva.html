  <title>The Case of the Wrong Cream and Echoes from Cape Verde and America - Tiffany Silva</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Born in the USA on July 4, 1945, from parents from the Cape Verde Island, it was hard for Tiffany to go unnoticed in life. Although of extraordinary beauty, she never placed importance on her physical appearance but rather on inner qualities, qualities she had to learn to refine and renew in order to survive on three continents. She learned the infinite and free gift that the Creator has given to each and every person: the ability to be born again an unending number of times, and that through pain and suffering, we can learn how to be better people, fellow humans who can make more gentle and livable the life on planet Earth. She hopes, through this book, and others that she will surely write, to reach out with love to every person on the face of the earth and help them to realize that all of us are unique, precious, and full of love that can only be visible if we try each and every day to love the Lord our God with all our heart, soul, body, and mind, and to love our neighbor (who is not just the man, woman, or child next door but a fellow human being who may be in need) as ourselves." />
