  <title>A Kiss In The Dark (Mills &amp; Boon Vintage Intrigue) - Jenna Mills</title>
      <meta name="description" content="
        &lt;p&gt;Found with blood on her hands, ice princess Bethany St. Croix became the prime suspect in her ex-husband&#39;s murder.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;But her chilly silence didn&#39;t fool one man. P.I. Dylan St. Croix had once been seared by the passion that blazed beneath Bethany&#39;s cool facade. And though they&#39;d parted bitterly before she&#39;d married his cousin, he couldn&#39;t desert her now.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Tragedy and silence had torn them apart. Yet after one dark, forbidden night of love, Bethany carried Dylan&#39;s baby. Nothing could douse the fire of possession that burned through Dylan, that made him want to lay claim to mother and child. But though he would risk his reputation to prove her innocence, would he risk his heart to win back her love?&lt;/p&gt;
