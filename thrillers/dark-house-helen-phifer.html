Lizzy pulled the covers over her head, then realised what was being dragged...&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For years, the Moore Asylum housed the forgotten children of Brooklyn Bay. But now, a man is found murdered in the derelict building, strapped to a steel trolley, launching a heart-racing investigation for &lt;b&gt;Detective Lucy Harwin&lt;/b&gt;. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lucy quickly discovers the victim was once a Moore Asylum doctor, and when a woman also linked to the home is killed on her doorstep, Lucy knows she must dig into its history. What dark secrets lie within the asylum&amp;#x2019;s walls &amp;#x2013; what was the scandal leading to its closure thirty years ago? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With her own demons to fight, Lucy starts to uncover the heartbreaking tale of the Moore Asylum children, and begins to wonder: who will be the next victim?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;A gripping serial killer thriller that will chill readers of MJ Arlidge, Angela Marsons and Rachel Abbott to the bone.&lt;/b&gt;&amp;#xa0;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Previously published as &lt;i&gt;The Lost Children&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;See what readers are saying about &lt;i&gt;Dark House&lt;/i&gt;:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#x2018;I really enjoyed this book, the writing is engaging, honest and believable&amp;#x2026;&lt;b&gt;I devoured it&lt;/b&gt; over 2 evenings and &lt;b&gt;I stayed up until WAY past my bedtime&lt;/b&gt; on the first night because &lt;b&gt;I didn&#39;t want to put it down!&amp;#x2019;&lt;/b&gt; &lt;i&gt;Urban Sapphire&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#x2018;&lt;b&gt;What a book!
