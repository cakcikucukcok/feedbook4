  <title>Due Diligence - Jonathan Rush</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;HE&#39;S GOT THE DEAL OF HIS LIFE ... NOW HE JUST HAS TO SURVIVE IT&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Louisiana-based CEO Mike Wilson needs to do a deal in a hurry, he turns to Wall Street investment bank Dyson Whitney. If they succeed in helping him buy transatlantic rival BritEnergy, there&#39;ll be a $70 million fee. If they fail, there&#39;s nothing.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rookie associate Rob Holding is thrown onto the team, doing due diligence at the investment bank. He quickly finds reason to suspect that there&#39;s more to the urgency of this deal than Mike Wilson has revealed. With their eyes on a huge fee, no one else at Dyson Whitney wants to know if there are problems.  But when a body turns up and Rob realizes it was meant to be him, he has no choice but to prove that he&#39;s right - or die in the attempt. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Due Diligence&lt;/i&gt; is set vividly in the post-credit-crunch world of international big business, the suspense never lets up as the action swings from war room to boardroom, from New York to London and back again in this action-packed and lightning-fast thriller.&lt;/p&gt;" />
