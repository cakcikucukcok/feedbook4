  <title>The Fireman - Joe Hill</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;From the award-winning, &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; bestselling author of &lt;em&gt;NOS4A2&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Heart-Shaped Box&lt;/em&gt; comes a chilling novel about a worldwide pandemic of spontaneous combustion that threatens to reduce civilization to ashes and a band of improbable heroes who battle to save it, led by one powerful and enigmatic man known as the Fireman.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The fireman is coming. Stay cool.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;No one knows exactly when it began or where it originated. A terrifying new plague is spreading like wildfire across the country, striking cities one by one: Boston, Detroit, Seattle. The doctors call it Draco Incendia Trychophyton. To everyone else it&amp;#8217;s Dragonscale, a highly contagious, deadly spore that marks its hosts with beautiful black and gold marks across their bodies&amp;#8212;before causing them to burst into flames. Millions are infected; blazes erupt everywhere. There is no antidote. No one is safe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Harper Grayson, a compassionate, dedicated nurse as pragmatic as Mary Poppins, treated hundreds of infected patients before her hospital burned to the ground. Now she&amp;#8217;s discovered the telltale gold-flecked marks on her skin. When the outbreak first began, she and her husband, Jakob, had made a pact: they would take matters into their own hands if they became infected. To Jakob&amp;#8217;s dismay, Harper wants to live&amp;#8212;at least until the fetus she is carrying comes to term. At the hospital, she witnessed infected mothers give birth to healthy babies and believes hers will be fine too. . . if she can live long enough to deliver the child.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Convinced that his do-gooding wife has made him sick, Jakob becomes unhinged, and eventually abandons her as their placid New England community collapses in terror. The chaos gives rise to ruthless Cremation Squads&amp;#8212;armed, self-appointed posses roaming the streets and woods to exterminate those who they believe carry the spore. But Harper isn&amp;#8217;t as alone as she fears: a mysterious and compelling stranger she briefly met at the hospital, a man in a dirty yellow fire fighter&amp;#8217;s jacket, carrying a hooked iron bar, straddles the abyss between insanity and death. Known as The Fireman, he strolls the ruins of New Hampshire, a madman afflicted with Dragonscale who has learned to control the fire within himself, using it as a shield to protect the hunted . . . and as a weapon to avenge the wronged.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the desperate season to come, as the world burns out of control, Harper must learn the Fireman&amp;#8217;s secrets before her life&amp;#8212;and that of her unborn child&amp;#8212;goes up in smoke.&lt;/p&gt;" />
