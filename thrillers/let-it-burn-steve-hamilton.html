  <title>Let It Burn - Steve Hamilton</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Alex McKnight swore to serve and protect Detroit as a police officer, but a trip to Motown these days is a trip to a past he&#39;d just as soon forget. The city will forever remind him of his partner&#39;s death and of the bullet still lodged in his own chest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then he gets a call from his old sergeant. A young man Alex helped put away--in the one big case that marked the high point of his career--will be getting out of prison. When the sergeant invites Alex downstate to have a drink for old times&#39; sake, it&#39;s an offer he would normally refuse. However, there&#39;s a certain female FBI agent he can&#39;t stop thinking about, so he gets in his truck and he goes back to Detroit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While there, he&#39;s reminded of something about that young man&#39;s case, a seemingly small piece of the puzzle that he never got to share. It&#39;s not something anyone wants to hear, but Alex can&#39;t let go of the feeling that they arrested the wrong man. And that the real killer not only got away, but went on to kill again.&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;Let it Burn&lt;/i&gt; continues the acclaimed Alex McKnight series by two-time Edgar award-winner and &lt;i&gt;New York Times &lt;/i&gt;bestselling author Steve Hamilton.&lt;/p&gt;" />
