Married to her college sweetheart, she owns a chain of upscale hair salons, and Derek runs his own company. They&#39;re admired in their community and are a loving family--until their world falls apart the day their son Sebastian is taken.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A year later, Marin is a shadow of herself. The FBI search has gone cold. The publicity has faded. She and her husband rarely speak. She hires a P.I. to pick up where the police left off, but instead of finding Sebastian, she learns that Derek is having an affair with a younger woman. This discovery sparks Marin back to life. She&#39;s lost her son; she&#39;s not about to lose her husband, too. Kenzie is an enemy with a &lt;i&gt;face&lt;/i&gt;, which means this is a problem Marin can &lt;i&gt;fix&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Permanently.&lt;/p&gt;" />
