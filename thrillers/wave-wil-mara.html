  <title>Wave - Wil Mara</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Winner of the New Jersey Notable Book Award!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s a beautiful day on the New Jersey shore.  The residents of Long Beach Island--a narrow strip of land connected to the mainland by a single bridge--are going about their daily routines, enjoying the lovely weather. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They have no idea that far out to sea, a plane carrying a nuclear device has crashed.  The resultant explosion triggers a massive underwater landslide . . . and a massive tsunami forms, heading straight for Long Beach Island.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By the time anyone realizes the water is coming, it&#39;s almost too late.  The National Guard is deployed--on the mainland, since the fast-approaching thirty-foot-high wall of water will flatten everything on the island.  Terrified residents stream toward the slender lifeline of the bridge, causing the island&#39;s first--and last--major traffic jam.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the frantic struggle to reach safety, strangers offer help to people they&#39;ve never seen before and neighbors turn against neighbors.  Some cannot decide which precious possessions must be saved, and so take nothing--or refuse to leave.  Others attempt to profit from the panic, looting abandoned homes and businesses.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Time is running out.  The first wave will hit in less than three hours.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the Publisher&#39;s request, this title is being sold without Digital Rights Management Software (DRM) applied.&lt;/p&gt;" />
