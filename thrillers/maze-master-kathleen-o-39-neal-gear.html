  <title>Maze Master - Kathleen O&#39;Neal Gear</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;New York Times &lt;/i&gt;bestselling author Kathleen Gear&#39;s new apocalyptic thriller &lt;i&gt;Maze Master&lt;/i&gt; shows the world ending not in fire nor in ice but in science.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kathleen Gear, who often co-writes with her husband W. Michael Gear, has authored 42 books which have been &lt;i&gt;New York Times, USA Today &lt;/i&gt;and international bestsellers. Translated into 29 languages, there are around 17 million copies of her books in print worldwide.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;LucentB is a retrovirus that&#39;s inevitable, unstoppable, and utterly catastrophic for humanity. The US government believes the only person who can find the cure is the geneticist who tried to warn them about it and then disappeared: James Hakari. They assign the task of finding him to his former student Anna Asher, who in turn recruits paleographer and religious studies scholar Dr. Martin Nadai.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The brilliant but insane geneticist is leaving clues for Anna and Martin to follow, showing he&#39;s truly earned his students&#39; nickname for him: the Maze Master. The search takes Anna and Martin around the world and into a warzone they never imagined.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Maze Master&lt;/i&gt;&#39;s LucentB is based off of the real retrovirus HERV-K, which has caused several plagues over the past 75,000 years, almost wiping out Neanderthals 50,000 years ago, and maybe 30,000 years ago. Modern geneticists consider HERV-K not to be extinct, but rather to be waiting for some trigger to come alive again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With its scientific and archaeological authenticity and suspenseful clues, &lt;i&gt;Maze Master &lt;/i&gt;will have readers rushing through its intricate maze to find out the fate of the world in this thrilling adventure.&lt;/p&gt;" />
