  <title>Luger Rounds - William Lynes</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Luger rounds; the expression implies ending the life of a patient whose illness requires an overwhelming effort to maintain, while being too sick to survive.&lt;p&gt; 
Is it an ominous coincidence when Dr. Phillip Thomas moves from the chief residency to being a patient in the ICU? Here he is left trapped, dying and alone in a tortuous world. Earlier he had confronted the possible assassin, but is soon deathly ill, comatose; a luger rounds candidate. Thomas realizes that he is the target of a hospital serial murder as he drifts into nightmarish dreams, while the silent assassin skulks in the darkness. &lt;/p&gt; 
An excerpt from Luger Rounds:&lt;br&gt; 
My mind returns to the cramped ICU room; aware of my condition, and continuous pain. The morphine has cleared, the dream state resolved, but my misery goes on. &lt;p&gt; 
I then sense an evil presence, and fear overwhelms every aching fiber of my dying body. An ominous air fills my darkened room. I am overwhelmed by dread. A tormentor sits; an assassin silent, starring, and waiting. I feel eyes on me; penetrating and bulging like a vultures, their proprietor seeing me as easy prey. I hear the assassins breathing, slow and ominous.&lt;/p&gt; 
In the menacing quiet evil eyes pierce me again. The tormentor is staring and willing me to crash; an assassin with a white coat covering a wicked heart.&lt;p&gt; 
The reader will be captivated by this tale of medical suspense. Told from the view point of the coma patient; medical intrigue and the reality of the critical care environment are captured in the life and death hospital setting." />
