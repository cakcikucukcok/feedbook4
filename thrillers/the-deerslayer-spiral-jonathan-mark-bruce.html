  <title>The Deerslayer Spiral - Jonathan Mark Bruce</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;B&gt;THE DEERSLAYER SPIRAL &lt;/B&gt;is a sexy legal thriller with a psychological twist.
&lt;P&gt;Ethan Compton is a handsome, ambitious law student with a beautiful, rich fiance, the daughter of the senior partner of a prestigious San Francisco law firm. He has left behind a tough early life to find himself with a promising legal career that could make all his dreams come true.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Things change, however, when a young woman is shot to death in the alley behind the trendy Inner Temple Caf. Ethan must help defend the murder suspect. Soon he becomes trapped in a murder case wherein he must enter the world of a mind-control expert who causes him to question his own sanity.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;A second murder rocks the city. Then, a third. As the killings escalate, Ethan suspects his work is being monitored and sabotaged. But by whom?&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Against his will, Ethan is led into a terrifying journey and must wrestle with memories from his brutal military career and his own mothers murder when he was a boy.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;With a shocking climax thats impossible to anticipate, The Deerslayer Spiral is a masterful exploration of high-stakes double-dealing with the legal establishment, the justice system and the government. You have never read anything like it.&lt;/P&gt;" />
