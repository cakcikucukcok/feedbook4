  <title>Sacrificial Lamb: a Legal Thriller - Nino Lama</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Sacrificial Lamba Legal Thriller is likely the most fast paced novel to be found anywhere. Two murders, two trials, conspiracies, twists and turns, a struggling defense lawyer and his lawyer son committed to saving their clients make this a fast page-turner, a novel you wont want to put down. 
	Vince DiMarco and his son defend two murders. One defendant is Vinces best friend and doctor, Billy Andrews, M.D. The second, Sterling Pierce, is the senior vice president of a local bank involved in international internet banking.
	The book begins with the trial of a young boy charged with statutory rape. Vince and Mike get him acquitted, much to the rage of the girls father, Sterling Pierce. The boy is murdered, and Pierce is charged. 
	The second murder takes place when Billy Andrews reveals to his wife hes having an affair. She takes an overdose of prescription drugs, and Andrews is charged with illegally providing her with narcotics leading to her deathmurder.
	Real trial proceedings, and a look behind the scenes of action packed criminal defense make this novel a must.
Aging trial lawyer Vince Di Marco would like to sit back and let his son run the firm, but his friends won&#39;t let him. They keep getting involved in things like divorce, bank fraud, and murder. How can Vince refuse someone he once was an altar boy with? So turn off your Law and Order reruns. Nino Lama&#39;s second book, Sacrificial Lambs is full of surprises, and will keep you entertained and guessing until the final pages.
Stephen Poleskie, author of The Balloonist -- The Story of T. S. C. Lowe, Inventor, Scientist, Magician, and Father of the U. S. Air Force
Nino Lama writes with a hard-boiled, ironic voice that you would expect from a fedora-wearing gat-packing hotshot of the 1930&#39;s -- only his hero Vince DiMarco isn&#39;t that at all:  lawyer, family man, lonely hearted lover man, Vince lives in the Finger Lakes region of New York and has a distinctly  21st Century sense of humor.   In this quick paced legal thriller, he&#39;s trying to do the right things for the right people and figure the angles on the bad guys, too -- and wow, how tricky that can be! 
Peter Fortunato, author of Letters to Tiohero. 
A rape and a divorce turn into a double murder, and his banker is suspected of fraud.  Lawyer Vince di Marco thinks he has it all under control - but when the bad guys looking to hit him mistakenly shoot his son and law partner, Mike, Vince loses it. Another fast-paced and engaging mystery from Nino Lama, featuring the funny and endearing father and son team of two lawyers fighting crime and corruption while trying to hold their own lives together.
