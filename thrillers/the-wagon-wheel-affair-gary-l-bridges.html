  <title>The Wagon Wheel Affair - Gary L Bridges</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Unknown by most, forgotten by many, a fifty-year-old secret buried beneath the Wagon Wheel Lodge in bucolic Cuchara, Colorado, threatens to erupt in a cloud of terror with unspeakable consequences for the United States. Ray Vernon, a WWII Medal of Honor recipient, literally holds the key to the secret. When Ray is murdered, his grandson, Stan, comes face-to-face with ISIS in an international race for the secret of the Wagon Wheel Lodge. Retired US federal agent Maggie Bell and her spouse, Steve Curry, a US Forest Service officer, are commissioned by the CIA and the DEA to investigate how a Mexican drug cartel and a large marijuana farm near the Purgatoire campground fit into the potentially deadly puzzle. Steve Curry goes undercover and is kidnapped by the Angel, a notorious Mexican drug lord. While being held at the Angels Mexican ranch, Steve and the Angel forge an unusual partnership to try to counter the terror that ISIS threatens to unleash on the United States. Meanwhile, Maggie deals with a young orphan girl who was abandoned in Cuchara, along with several other orphans when the cartel pulls up stakes. How does the community of Cuchara respond to a sudden influx of orphan children? Maggie has to make a heartrending decision that will affect her and Steves marriage for the rest of their lives." />
