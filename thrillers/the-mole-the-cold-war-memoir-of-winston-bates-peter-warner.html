  <title>The Mole: The Cold War Memoir of Winston Bates - Peter Warner</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The fictitious memoir of an unlikely foreign spy planted in Washington, D.C., in the years after World War II&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;Recruited by a foreign power in postwar Paris and sent to Washington, Winston Bates is without training or talent. He might be a walking definition of the anti-spy. Yet he makes his way onto the staff of the powerful Senator Richard Russell, head of the Armed Services Committee. From that perch, Bates has extensive and revealing contacts with the Dulles brothers, Richard Bissell, Richard Helms, Lyndon Johnson, Joe Alsop, Walter Lippman, Roy Cohn, and even Ollie North to name but a few of the historical players in the American experience Winston befriends--and haplessly betrays for a quarter century.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A comedy of manners set within the circles of power and information, Peter Warner&#39;s &lt;i&gt;The Mole&lt;/i&gt; is a witty social history of Washington in the latter half of the twentieth century that presents the question: How much damage can be done by the wrong person in the right place at the right time?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Written as Winston&#39;s memoir, &lt;i&gt;The Mole&lt;/i&gt; details the American Century from an angle definitely off center. From Suez, the U-2 Crash, the Bay of Pigs, Vietnam, and Watergate, the novel is richly and factually detailed, marvelously convincing, and offers the reader a slightly subversive character searching for identity and meaning (as well as his elusive handler) in a heady time during one of history&#39;s most defining eras.&lt;/p&gt;" />
