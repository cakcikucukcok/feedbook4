  <title>The Last Drop of Blood - J. Stephen Funk</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This book is the outgrowth of one of J. Stephen Funks major injury lawsuits, one in the 1970s, where the dishonesty and a conspiracy of silence by the medical profession supported a negligent doctors efforts to maintain his exalted and privileged place in society. In real life, he exposed the doctors duplicity for all to see, and provided an orphaned child just legal compensation for the loss of her young and innocent mother. In Last Drop of Blood, the heartless and amoral doctor, his wife and her father will stop at nothing to conceal the truth. The widowed husband and a courageous, young nurse provide the help a relentless attorney needs to expose the conspiracy. Through twists and turns, the unexpected ending reveals itself to be more just and satisfying than predictable." />
