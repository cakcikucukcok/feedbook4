  <title>Who Do You Trust? (Mills &amp; Boon Vintage Intrigue) - Melissa James</title>
      <meta name="description" content="
        &lt;p&gt;Two images kept Mitch McCluskey fighting for life on the secret mission he&#39;d sworn would be his last: reuniting with his sons…&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;and seeing sweet Melissa Carroll. Without hesitation, his childhood friend had made her home his boys&#39;, but Mitch sensed that some man had made Lissa doubt her desirability…just as someone was making her fear the &lt;em&gt;last&lt;/em&gt; person who would ever hurt her.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Him.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Lissa wanted to believe that Mitch was one of the good guys, just as she wanted to believe that the feral look in his eyes was for a passion fifteen years postponed. But despite his beloved familiarity, Mitch was a stranger she&#39;d been warned not to trust. Problem was, her heart wasn&#39;t responding to the warning.&lt;/p&gt;
