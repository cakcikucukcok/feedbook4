        &lt;p&gt;One night of passion was enough to convince Detective Marco Angelosi that Paige Burkett was a woman he&#39;d risk everything to protect.

        &lt;p&gt;Being kidnapped by her former lover wasn&#39;t exactly what Paige had in mind when she and her canine partner tracked down Marco. But now that she&#39;s back in his arms, she&#39;s got to convince her fugitive guardian that love isn&#39;t about making sacrifices…but holding on.&lt;/p&gt;
