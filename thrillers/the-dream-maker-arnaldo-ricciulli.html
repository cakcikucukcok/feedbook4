  <title>The Dream Maker - Arnaldo Ricciulli</title>
      <meta name="description" content="On the way home from visiting their eldest son at university, Dan and Malou Politano had stopped in Pahokee and had both decided to take up an offer from an old Seminole Indian to re-visit their past. During their journey, they went through an incredible adventure which drove them to relive many of Dans childhood memories and some fantastic ancestral events while completing twelve tasks. These tasks were all designed to reinforce or ignite desires for Dan to redress his family life after a horrible skiing accident, which had occurred thirteen years earlier, had left him questioning his destiny and ignoring his future  or the future that was staring him in the face. 
While returning to the present, Dan and Malou were separated. Malou was the only one who made it back to 2013. As for Dan, he had unfortunately returned further in time and had lost all memory of his travels into the past with Malou. He had been found in a forest clearing  unconscious  and had been transported to the nearest hospital in Key West, Florida. When he woke up and regained his senses, he soon realized that he didnt even know his name. Suffering from post-traumatic amnesia, the only name he remembered was the one of an old shepherd  Damianos. Not having anywhere to stay  he couldnt remember where he lived either  Dan was sent to a shelter where he was to share a room with another man named Gustavo." />
