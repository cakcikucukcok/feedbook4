  <title>Night Work - Steve Hamilton</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;With &lt;i&gt;Night Work&lt;/i&gt;, award-winning author of the acclaimed Alex McKnight series Steve Hamilton delivers an atmospheric standalone thriller.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Joe Trumbull is not a man who scares easily. But tonight he is scared to death.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It&#39;s been two years since Joe&#39;s fiancée, Laurel, was murdered. Two years of grief and loneliness. On this hot summer night, he&#39;s finally going on a blind date, his first since Laurel&#39;s death. He&#39;s not looking for love, just testing the waters to see if it&#39;s possible to live a normal life again. And after the first awkward minutes, Joe starts to think this date wasn&#39;t such a bad idea after all. In fact, maybe it will turn out to be one of the best things that ever happened to him.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;He couldn&#39;t be more wrong. Because somehow, for reasons Joe doesn&#39;t yet understand, this one evening will mark the beginning of a new nightmare. A nightmare that will lead him to realize that the past is never past. And the worst is yet to come.&lt;/p&gt;" />
