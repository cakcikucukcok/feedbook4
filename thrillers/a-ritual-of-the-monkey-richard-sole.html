  <title>A Ritual of the Monkey - Richard Sole</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;B&gt;A Professional Review&lt;/B&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&quot;In this kind of fractured reality, the clever idea is that we never know what is real.&quot;
Stella Westhoff, &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;A dream invasion adventure epic, Richard Sole swims into the swirly sea of the subconscious shifting logic with fractured reality of dreams. &quot;A Ritual of the Monkey&quot; is surely an ambitious psychological thriller, brilliantly conceived and superbly written. It tells the story of Ezra Cantrell adrift in time and experience, in reality within dreams; dreams without reality as he enters in a world where dreams and reality are indecipherable. What is real and what is not becomes a mind-bending, time-twisting odyssey. &lt;P/&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Ezra Cantrell is a Foreign Service employee who meets and marries Sacha, an Indonesian woman. The all-important establishment of the book&#39;s premise is made meticulously and at great length as Ezra travels on assignments. Ultimately, it is the experience of the book that toys with the reader&#39;s mind on a massive scale. As Sacha&#39;s emotional pain and the symptoms of her disease become apparent, she is betrayed with frightening delusions. She descends into madness and then regains the ability to function in her world or is it?&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Alternating between what is real and what is not, Richard Sole hypnotizes us with elegant dreamscapes within cityscapes and as a tour guide, takes the reader to distant lands and introduce them to its culture and mores. Like any traditional narrative, the book starts at point A and ends at point B. It just goes backward through the alphabet to get there.
A slippery, cerebral drama that slaloms from illusion to reality and back again leaving the reader bewitched and bothered. It is the story of good and evil, a narrative of America&#39;s imperial character versus radical Islamic Jihad, it is the tangle of relationships that goes against the grain and challenges eternal truths.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;A well crafted and enthralling brain teaser, &quot;A Ritual of the Monkey&quot; is either a great, mind-bending book or one big swindle. Let&#39;s go with the former.&lt;P/&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Stella Westhoff
Atlanta, Georgia &lt;/P&gt;
                                                              &lt;B&gt; About The Book&lt;/B&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Spurred by a desire to travel the world, Ezra Cantrell joined the Foreign Service and saw it all- Thousand islands of Indonesia, soaring minarets in Kyrgyzstan, Uzbekistans bulbous blue domes, and many pleasant tree-filled streets around the world. His journeys traversed the continents casting a spell on any travelers imagination. Along with Sacha his Indonesian spouse, their magical journey is a measure for adventure,... or misadventure. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Then the ragged wounds of life strike Sacha with an emotional disorder and strip her of a fulfilling life experience. Her obsessive ritual is matched only by the lecherous fetish of a French diplomat who falls in love with her nineteen-year-old daughter. The mishmash adds a disquieting twist to an already sick family dynamic. Lost in the shuffle, Sacha struggles as she trails her husband on international assignments. With each move she starts again in a different city. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Adrift in real time and dream time, Ezra finds solace from the family turmoil, as he escapes on assignments and soon experiments with his sexual curiosity. Tormented by his secret desires, he struggles to stave off the gremlins. Along comes a sociopath brimming with wicked desires who spews a disturbing shroud over an American university campus. A delusional love affair sprouts, a bruised ego ruptures and a sick obsession with a sadistic bent is unleashed with dreadful outcomes. What appears to be isolated slayings soon turn into the handiwork of a demented mind setting off an intercontinental jealous rage that chills the mind in this dream invasion epic. &lt;/P&gt;" />
