  <title>Nowhere To Hide (Mills &amp; Boon Vintage Intrigue) - RaeAnne Thayne</title>
      <meta name="description" content="
        &lt;p&gt;As an on-the-run single mother out to protect her little girls, Lisa Connors needed two things: money, and to keep her identity secret. But it was just her luck that the possibility of the former would threaten the latter–for as the caretaker of the hunk-next-door with two broken legs, her ability to keep her distance was already shaky.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;When she found out said hunk&#39;s profession–FBI agent–it was downright demolished….&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Gage McKinnon had spent most of his life trying to keep away from all things familial, so the last thing he needed was to have two adorable little girls take root next door. But it was their mother who posed his greatest threat. For in Lisa he felt that door in his heart–the one that had been slammed shut twenty-five years ago–start to open, just a crack.&lt;/p&gt;
