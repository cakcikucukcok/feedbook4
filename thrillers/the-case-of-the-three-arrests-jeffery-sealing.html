  <title>The Case of the Three Arrests - Jeffery Sealing</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Daniel decides to take on a controversial subject of law in the state of Colorado. His success and courtroom prowess have not gone unnoticed by various DAs, the judges he has had to face, nor the press. Daniel comes to work one morning to find three couples waiting for him. These married couples ask Daniel for his assistance on filing their appeals of their convictions in the Colorado appellate court system. Daniel, despite being harassed, intimidated and threatened by various legal agencies in Colorado, decides to stick with the appeals process. As Daniel digs deeper into the appealers cases, the worse things imaginable in the criminal justice system come alive. The couples were targeted and Daniel soon finds out how corrupt the criminal justice system really is. For Daniel, the appeals cases soon push beyond anything he has ever faced in or out of the courtroom. Will the appeals process stop at the appellate court? The Colorado State Supreme Court, Or, will the final resting place for the appeals be the highest court in the land: the U.S. Supreme Court? Are the appealers prepared for the possibility that their arrests, charges and convictions may be upheld? Find out if Daniel loses his license to practice law for these appeals." />
