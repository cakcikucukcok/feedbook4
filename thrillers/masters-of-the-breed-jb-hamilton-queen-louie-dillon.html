  <title>Masters of the Breed - Jb Hamilton Queen, Louie Dillon</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div class=&quot;product_description&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When a friends Triple Crown winner is found mutilated, her ovaries surgically removed, and a security guard shot to death, private investigator Jessica Langdon and FBI agent Hunter Rawls team up to find the guilty party. That same night, a veterinarian is reported missing, and uncannily, Jessie is hired by his wife to find him. His car is pulled from the Kentucky River, and now his wife and child have disappeared. Doctor Jonathan Richards, a distinguished geneticist, whom Jessie has known briefly is leaving disturbing messages on her answering machine. When she learns he is friends with Leo Lowenthal, the veterinarians employer and owner of Camelot, a well-known race horse farm, she becomes suspicious that he may know something about the murder of the Triple Crown winner, and the missing vet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Her search comes to an abrupt end when the death of a man she swore to bring to justice for her daughters murder turns up dead, and she is arrested, handcuff ed and driven away by the two arresting officers. A short time later, they are found full of bullet holes and Jessica is missing. Only one man knows who killed them and where they have taken Jessica.&lt;/p&gt;
