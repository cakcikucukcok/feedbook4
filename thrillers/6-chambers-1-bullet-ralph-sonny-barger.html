  <title>6 Chambers, 1 Bullet - Ralph &quot;Sonny&quot; Barger</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;In this second adventure from bestselling author Sonny Barger, hard&amp;#8211;living antihero Patch Kinkade must find a way to bust in to prison if he&amp;#39;s going to figure out who is responsible for killing three of his brothers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Patch Kinkade, the notorious leader of the infamous and feared Infidelz motorcycle club, has faced down a wide array of bad guys in his day. But when three of his fellow club members show up dead in a meat locker&amp;#8211;&amp;#8211;frozen stiff on their bikes, with counterfeit $100 bills stuffed in their mouths &amp;#8211; and the funny money leads back to the Russian mob, Patch is ready to add some ex&amp;#8211;Pinkos to his hit list.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After shaking down a couple of Russian hooker/con artists, Patch learns that there&amp;#39;s a new Russian crime family, the Shalinsky Cartel, trying to establish their turf, and the murdered Infidelz were unfortunate casualties in their ruthless campaign. The Russians&amp;#39; leader is awaiting trial in prison, and it seems that Patch won&amp;#39;t be able to get to the bottom of things without going to extreme measures. Soon he&amp;#39;s behind bars himself, after cooking up an ingenious scheme to get at the Russian godfather, where he hopes to send a clear message &amp;#8211; don&amp;#39;t mess with the brotherhood of the Infidelz &amp;#8211;with one well&amp;#8211;placed shank. Now Patch&amp;#39;s well&amp;#8211;honed skills, learned inside and outside of prison walls, must serve him well if he&amp;#39;s to avenge his compatriots&amp;#39; deaths, and regain dominance for the Infidelz once and for all.&lt;/p&gt;" />
