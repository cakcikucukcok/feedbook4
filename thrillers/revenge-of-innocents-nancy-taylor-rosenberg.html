  <title>Revenge Of Innocents - Nancy Taylor Rosenberg</title>
      <meta name="description" content="In her novels featuring California probation officer Carolyn Sullivan, &lt;i&gt;New York Times &lt;/i&gt;bestselling author Nancy Taylor Rosenberg brilliantly fuses gripping plotlines with a razor-sharp portrayal of a single woman in a world of shattered lives, hard-core criminals and flickering hopes. In her new novel, Carolyn confronts the brutal death of her best friend--and the dark mystery that surrounds it.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  Carolyn knew everything about Veronica Campbell. She knew about the case of murder and retribution that haunted her life and career. About her stormy relationship with her husband Drew. About the emotional darkness that was overwhelming Veronica&#39;s fragile seventeen-year-old daughter Jude. But seeing her friend laid out on a cold hard slab of steel in a morgue, and hearing the initial judgments of the investigators, Carolyn also knows this: there&#39;s no way Veronica would have ever taken her own life. And when Carolyn receives a note threatening her away from the case, she knows a killer is at large.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  Carolyn must separate lies from truths in a world of complex relationships and battered psyches. As a hidden side of Veronica&#39;s life emerges, including the stunning possibility that Veronica had taken a lover, Carolyn becomes increasingly involved with Veronica&#39;s daughter, who claims her father has been abusing her for years. Trusting a person she doesn&#39;t truly know, putting her own upcoming marriage with wealthy, charming Marcus Wright in jeopardy, Carolyn investigates the brutal murder of another young woman. With danger and deceit swirling all around her, Carolyn is determined to lure her prime suspect out of the shadows. But all the while a killer is coming straight after her.  .  .  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  Relentlessly paced with revealing insights into the criminal justice system, &lt;i&gt;Revenge Of Innocents&lt;/i&gt; showcases Nancy Taylor Rosenberg at the height of her riveting storytelling talent." />
