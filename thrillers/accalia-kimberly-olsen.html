  <title>Accalia - Kimberly Olsen</title>
      <meta name="description" content="In antiquity she was born, and on the modern streets she walks.  Who is she? What is she?  Half woman, half wolf, she represents everything we want to be  and would fear ever to be. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
She is a wanderer and has lived in many places, but now we encounter her in her current abode of Buenos Aires, Argentina. She uses the name Diana and works as a sous-chef, in order to assimilate herself into normal life. She has many talents, and is gifted with keen insight. In her human form, she has an odd way of being able to help people, but her curse still afflicts her.   She must kill to survive.  Brutal murders are being discovered around the city, and a man investigating them will cross paths with her in a chance meeting.  They encounter each other again, at a Tango dance hall, and neither would ever be the same after that.
&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;
She has to be wary about her relationships with humans, but will she let herself go this time?  Will she be able to explore human emotion on a deeper level, perhaps putting at risk the life of the very man who manages to open her heart?  Will he find out that the woman he has fallen for is the very monster he is trying to catch?
&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;
This is a chilling novel, but it also deals with the human psyche, duality, exploring other sides of ourselves, tapping into our senses, a womans power, vulnerability, love, detachment, mortality, societys hypocrisy, and of course- how appearances can be deceiving. Not only can appearances be deceiving, but often people dont even know themselves" />
