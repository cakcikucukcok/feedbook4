  <title>Waking the Dead - Heather Graham</title>
      <meta name="description" content="

          &lt;strong&gt;They say a painting can have a life of its own…&lt;/strong&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;In the case of &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ghosts in the Mind&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; by Henry Sebastian Hubert, that&#39;s more than just an expression. This painting is reputed to come to life–and to bring death. The artist was a friend of Lord Byron and Mary Shelley, joining them in Switzerland during 1816, &quot;the year without a summer.&quot; That was when they all explored themes of horror and depravity in their art….&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Now, almost two hundred years later, the painting appears in New Orleans. Wherever it goes, death seems to follow.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Danielle Cafferty and Michael Quinn, occasional partners in solving crime, are quickly drawn into the case. They begin to make connections between that summer in Switzerland and this spring in Louisiana. Danni, the owner of an eccentric antiques shop, and Quinn, a private detective, have discovered that they have separate but complementary talents when it comes to investigating &lt;em&gt;unusual&lt;/em&gt; situations.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Trying to blend their personal relationship with the professional lives they&#39;ve stumbled into, they learn how much they need each other. Especially as they confront this work of art–and evil. The people in the portrait might be dead, but &lt;em&gt;something&lt;/em&gt; seems to wake them and free them to commit bloody crimes. Cafferty and Quinn must discover what that is. And they have to destroy it–before it destroys them.&lt;/p&gt;
