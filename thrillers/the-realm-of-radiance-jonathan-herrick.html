  <title>The Realm of Radiance - jonathan Herrick</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;SYNOPSIS:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jonah and his beloved father live alone on a wild isolated Island off the North Atlantic coast. When his father dies in a car crash, the despairing seventeen-year old attempts to drown himself. As he is about to lose consciousness, the mysterious Voice of the Wind urges him to live and to discover the true purpose of his life. That purpose is ultimately to find the Realm of Radiance, which he once glimpsed as a child.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jonah&amp;rsquo;s journey leads him from the North Atlantic to the Great Western Mountains, through life-threatening disasters and dazzling triumphs. On the way, he encounters a series of unique mentors. The first is a young sorceress who blows his mind and captures his heart. She introduces him to a trickster Master Wizard who teaches him magic. To Jonah&amp;rsquo;s horror, the magic isn&amp;rsquo;t always what he expects. After he manages to recover from the Wizard&amp;rsquo;s nightmarish prank, almost everyone he meets turns out to be a teacher, including an unusual truck driver who takes him cross-country to the feet of the Wizard&amp;rsquo;s older brother. This rogue spiritual Master puts Jonah through unimaginable trials. Struggling with life, death and his own sanity, it is his last chance to discover the Realm of Radiance.&lt;/p&gt;" />
