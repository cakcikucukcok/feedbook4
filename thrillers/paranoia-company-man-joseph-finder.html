When he manipulates the system to do something nice for a friend, he finds himself charged with a crime. Corporate Security gives him a choice: prison - or become a spy in the headquarters of their chief competitor, Trion Systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They train him. They feed him inside information. Now, at Trion, he&#39;s a star, skyrocketing to the top. He finds he has talents he never knew he possessed. He&#39;s rich, drives a Porsche, lives in a fabulous apartment, and works directly for the CEO. He&#39;s dating the girl of his dreams. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His life is perfect. And all he has to do to keep it that way is betray everyone he cares about and everything he believes in.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But when he tries to break off from his controllers, he finds he&#39;s in way over his head, trapped in a world in which nothing is as it seems and no one can really be trusted. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And then the real nightmare begins...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From the writer whose novels have been called &quot;thrilling&quot; (&lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt;) and &quot;dazzling&quot; (&lt;i&gt;USA Today&lt;/i&gt;) comes an electrifying new novel, a roller-coaster ride of suspense that will hold the reader hostage until the final, astonishing twist.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;COMPANY MAN&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;A high octane thrill ride!&quot; - San Francisco Chronicle on Paranoia&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Joseph Finder&#39;s New York Times bestseller Paranoia was hailed by critics as &quot;jet-propelled,&quot; the &quot;Page Turner of the Year,&quot; and &quot;the archetype of the thriller in its contemporary form.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now Finder returns with Company Man - a heart-stopping thriller about ambition, betrayal, and the price of secrets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nick Conover is the CEO of a major corporation, a local boy made good, and once the most admired man in a company town. But that was before the layoffs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When a faceless stalker menaces his family, Nick, a single father of two since the recent death of his wife, finds that the gated community they live in is no protection at all. He decides to take action, a tragedy ensues - and immediately his life spirals out of control.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At work, Nick begins to uncover a conspiracy against him, involving some of his closest colleagues. He doesn&#39;t know who he can trust - including the brilliant, troubled new woman in his life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, his actions are being probed by a homicide detective named Audrey Rhimes, a relentless investigator with a strong sense of morality - and her own, very personal reason for pursuing Nick Conover. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With everything he cares about in the balance, Nick discovers strengths he never knew he had. His enemies don&#39;t realize how hard he&#39;ll fight to save his company. And nobody knows how far he&#39;ll go to protect his family.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mesmerizing and psychologically astute, Company Man is Joseph Finder&#39;s most compelling and original novel yet.&lt;/p&gt;" />
