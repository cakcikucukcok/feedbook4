  <title>Paris Spring - James Naughtie</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;DIV&gt;James Naughtie established himself a &quot;capable and elegant writer+? (Wall Street Journal) with his gripping and highly praised debut, The Madness of July. He sets his new, &quot;brilliant spy thriller+? (The Guardian) in the feverish atmosphere of Paris, in April of 1968. The cafes are alive with talk of revolution, but for Scottish-American Will Flemyng--a spy working in the British Embassy--the crisis is personal. A few words from a stranger on the metro change his life. His family is threatened with ruin and he now faces the spy&#39;s oldest fear: exposure.Freddy Craven is the hero and mentor Flemyng would trust with his life, but when he is tempted into a dark, Cold War labyrinth, he chooses the dangerous path and plays his game alone. And when glamorous, globe-trotting journalist Grace Quincy, in pursuit of a big story, is found dead in the Père Lachaise cemetery, the question is raised--what side was she on? Certainly she knew too much, and had become dangerous. But to whom? The bizarre murder reveals a web of secrets, and Fleming&#39;s loyalty to family and friends is tested as never before. As the streets of Paris become a smoke-filled battleground, Flemyng, like his friends and enemies, discovers that where secrets are at stake, lives are too. Once again James Naughtie spins an irresistible, intelligent, and page turning thriller.&lt;/DIV&gt;" />
