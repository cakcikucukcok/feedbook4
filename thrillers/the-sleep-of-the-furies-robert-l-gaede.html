  <title>The Sleep of the Furies - Robert L. Gaede</title>
      <meta name="description" content="One night, Patrick Lott makes two momentous choices that will forever change his life: he takes a fortune belonging to the crime-boss he works for, and he saves a little girl from her totally unfit mother, before he runs to Mexico. He thinks hes rescuing Morinda from a nightmare, but hes only delayed her ordeal.
Lott and Morinda live a peaceful existence in the quiet sea-side town of San Estaban, until his past returns to prey on him and his daughter. The Furies have slept for twelve long years, but now theyve awakened. Both Lott and Morinda will be forced to pay the price for the two decisions he made years before.
After her fathers shot down in cold blood, Morinda becomes the victim of a savage rape while she crosses the border. She continues north to L.A. alone, trying to find the mother she never knew. On the way, shes plunged into a world of violence and deceit, brutality and betrayal. Ultimately shes brought to a fateful encounter with the man who ordered her fathers death." />
