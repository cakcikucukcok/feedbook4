  <title>The Girl with the Lightning Brain - Cliff Ratza</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Electra is exceptional. She knows that. And she also knows her extraordinary abilities &amp;ndash; the paranormal aftermath of a near-death experience at birth &amp;ndash; are secrets that must never be revealed. Her life depends on it.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
So begins chapter one in book one of the ground-breaking &amp;ldquo;Lightning Brain&amp;rdquo; action-adventure series that extrapolates the latest science, political intrigue, and contemporary lifestyles while tracing the twists and turns in the life of Electra &amp;ldquo;Kit&amp;rdquo; Kittner. She grows up in a frightened, intolerant America threatened by &amp;ldquo;Techno-Plague&amp;rdquo; and Middle East Terrorism. The action builds relentlessly, from lighter childhood adventures to darker realities caused by America&amp;rsquo;s threats that are exacerbated by a harsh government that would treat her badly if it were to discover what she is. Electra is more than up to the challenge, choosing a career path on which she fights these existential problems.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Readers are invited to enjoy the series at whatever level they choose: from a gripping action-packed thriller all the way to an exploration of the timeless challenges &amp;ldquo;the human condition&amp;rdquo; presents each of us. And along the way, be prepared to meet a cast of endearing characters, each having strengths and weaknesses we can empathize with. We welcome you to join us.&lt;/p&gt;" />
