In a moonlit field, the villagers await an arms shipment they need to make a last-ditch fight against the advancing Serbs. The promised delivery never comes, and the village is overrun.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eighteen years later, a body is unearthed from a field, and with it the identity of the arms dealer who betrayed them. Now the villagers can plot their revenge.  &lt;br&gt;In leafy England, Harvey Gillot regards himself a man of his world. There is only one blemish on his record, and that was all a long time ago. But Gillot, his family, his friends and his enemies are about to be pitched into a sequence of events that will unfold across Europe with breath-taking drama and almost biblical power.&lt;br&gt;Harvey Gillott is about to find out what happens when the hand of the past reaches out to the present-and it&#39;s holding a gun.&lt;/p&gt;" />
