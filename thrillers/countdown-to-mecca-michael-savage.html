  <title>Countdown to Mecca - Michael Savage</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;From &lt;i&gt;The New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author of &lt;i&gt;Abuse of Power &lt;/i&gt;and &lt;i&gt;A Time for War&lt;/i&gt; and radio host of &lt;i&gt;The Savage Nation&lt;/i&gt; comes a powerful thriller, &lt;i&gt;Countdown to Mecca&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A plane bound for Amman, Jordan goes down in the Caspian Sea. The crash yields no survivors--save the Russian mercenary who hijacked the flight--and a cask containing an agent of unprecedented destructive potential is missing from the wreckage. A carefully plotted terrorist attack has been put into motion, and the resulting chaos might be enough to push America toward another costly war.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The one man who might be able to stop the attack is Jack Hatfield, a freelance reporter who has never shied away from controversy. After making a politically incorrect statement about Islamic extremists, he has been discredited as a journalist and left to pick up the pieces of his career. But when his half-brother Sammy calls him, saying that his neighbor Ana overheard something she shouldn&#39;t have and now both their lives are in danger, Jack realizes he&#39;s stumbled upon a conspiracy to destroy Mecca. Now he, and a group of likeminded friends on the fringes of the law, must uncover who is behind the plot and stop them--or else witness the collapse of the world into a war of mutually assured global destruction.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Michael Savage&#39;s &lt;i&gt;Countdown to Mecca&lt;/i&gt; is a gripping page-turner that takes readers on a journey where even the seemingly innocent aren&#39;t always innocent, the loyal aren&#39;t always loyal, and that even those counted on to serve their country, cannot always be counted on to protect it. With the threat of a third world war looming, Jack Hatfield must stop the destruction... before somebody can stop him.&lt;/p&gt;" />
