  <title>The Good Marine&#39;s Murder - David   C. Corbett</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Colonel Jack Adams crashes an AV-8B, Harrier in the middle of a North Carolina Bean field. The task of sorting out the cause of his friend&amp;rsquo;s accident falls to Colonel Dan Breakheart, the Second Marine Air Wing&amp;rsquo;s Safety Officer. Within days of the start of his investigation, Breakheart realizes that, not only sabotage was indeed a factor, regarding his friend&amp;rsquo;s death, but that it may be murder as well. Using information Jack&amp;rsquo;s wife provides, Breakheart begins delving into the last few days of Colonel Adam&amp;rsquo;s life. With the help of a young and lovely NADEP engineer and his best buddy, Major &amp;ldquo;Snake&amp;rdquo; Burns, he must solve the mystery quickly, but to do so, places himself in harm&amp;rsquo;s way, while smoking the malefactor into a confession.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Praise for David C. Corbett&amp;rsquo;s, &amp;ldquo;A Good Marine&amp;rsquo;s Murder&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;Great story-grabber, right from the prologue. You don&amp;rsquo;t need me to tell you that your descriptions of Marine Corps life and flying were right on the money! I felt like I was there the whole way.&amp;rdquo; -Major General Richard A. Gustafson, USCMC (Ret.) &amp;ldquo;...I read this book in two days...11 chapters the first day, and then finished it off early in the morning of the second day. I had a hard time putting it down, as I was so hooked into the story and my familiarity with everything in the book from Cherry Point, Harriers, fighter pilots, O&amp;rsquo; Club, Memorials for fellow pilots, Hancock Yacht Club and its regatta, the Wing HQ, the Commanding General and Assistant Wing Commander, Chief of Staff and G-3, NIS, NADEP, and Marine officer wives. I was held captive, but it was exactly what I like reading about and kept me wanting more.&amp;rdquo; -Major General Michael Sullivan, USMC (Ret.)&lt;/p&gt;" />
