  <title>Moneybags - Tulley Holland</title>
      <meta name="description" content="In the early 1980&#39;s, a violent kidnapping leaves several people dead on the C&amp;O Canal Towpath near Georgetown, Washington, D.C.  Several days later, a parachutist is found dead, hanging upside down from a tree in the Virginia countryside.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
	The two events seem unrelated, especially to Will MacKenzie, the man who discovers the dead parachutist while walking his dog.  MacKenzie, a Viet Nam veteran, is familiar with parachutes, but is puzzled by the color of the parachute as well as the color of the parachutists clothing:  all colors are black and the face of the dead man is covered in black camouflage.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
	Additional black parachutes are found by his dog nearby, but these are attached to heavy, black duffle bags.  A wrapped packet of hundred dollar bills is partially exposed, next to a small rip in one of the bags.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
	This discovery could change his life, as he is struggling to recover from alcoholism and depression, problems that have caused him to lose his job, his family, and his friends.  Faced with a choice of reporting his gruesome find to the authorities, or keeping the bags that may hold a great deal of money, MacKenzie takes the duffle bags to his mountain cabin to examine their contents without being disturbed.  He is unaware that his lucky find is part of a large ransom payment.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
	MacKenzies decision to keep the moneybags triggers a trail of violence, as killers from the Mafia, a D.C. drug gang, and a Colombian Drug Cartel, form an unholy alliance to search for the missing ransom.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
	The cast of characters includes the veteran who is trying to rebuild his life, and a woman of wealth, privilege, and power, who find each other as they attempt to escape the tentacles of a billion dollar Drug Empire.  A corrupt deputy sheriff and a philanthropist with a secret stand in their way." />
