  <title>Many Deaths In The Multiverse - Christopher A Zammit</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Our modern society is broken. After centuries of war, terrorism and rampant nationalism, the human race has divided itself into a myriad of exclusionist groups that look upon each other with fear and distrust. Yet they have one thing in common, an oppressive Corporatocracy which has covertly ensnared the global population in virtual slavery for their own financial gain.&lt;br /&gt;
High above the Earth, an Australian research group named ANZAR have discovered a way in which they can free the world from the system that enslaves it, unify the human race, and (hopefully) reunite their founders with the wives that were cruelly taken from them fourteen year earlier. Using experimental technology, two Professors make a dangerous journey that will alter the lives of everyone on the planet.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
It doesn&amp;#39;t go to plan.&lt;br /&gt;
After having gone missing for ten days, the Professors&amp;#39; empty machine reappears in orbit around the Earth. Before it can be retrieved it is surrounded by thousands of glowing spheres which appear through a doorway in space and encircle the globe. Millions die in the global disaster which would become known as The Blackout. With ANZAR&amp;rsquo;s research blamed for the attack, and the military on their way to shut down their labs, the Professors&amp;rsquo; sons flee into the maze of alternate realities in which their fathers had vanished.&lt;br /&gt;
Determined to arrest the scientists as ordered, Captain Kyle Ferine commandeers a second ANZAR machine and leads his team of hardened soldiers in pursuit of the fleeing ANZAR scientists. As the two groups come into contact and are forced to rely on each other for survival, Ferine has to decide whether he will place the ANZAR scientists under arrest or act as their protectors as they struggle to find the missing professors, search for a way to save the Earth, and survive the horrors that await them on each layer of the Multiverse.&lt;/p&gt;" />
