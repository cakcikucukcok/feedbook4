  <title>Joshua&#39;s Atlas - Gerald T Dale</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Joshua had no intentions of becoming a super hero when he first invented Bernie his flying sports car but when there is a serious need that only he can ease, he is quick to volunteer his services and his creation.
     Joshuas style and vulnerability quickly becomes evident when he finds that his activities must remain completely shrouded in secrecy while he mingles within the society that he ventures to protect.
     JOSHUSS ATLAS offers creative unauthenticated thinking that encourages inquisitive minds to think for themselves at the same time it provides a fathomable story that is guaranteed to remain with you throughout the ages.  It also illustrates the charisma, maturity and dignity that is brought about in our youth today.  An attractive must read addition to any high school library.  Although analogous in many ways to the mildly hokey Superman legend, it offers many degrees of realism that is not present in that memorable saga.
     Get ready to feel the turbulence of flight and the rumble of the tires upon the rolling landings as Joshua explores Bernies veiled limitations.  Only a true sports car aficionado can know the feeling that goes along with the testing of these limits." />
