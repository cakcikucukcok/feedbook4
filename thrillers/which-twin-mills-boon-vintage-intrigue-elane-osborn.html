  <title>Which Twin? (Mills &amp; Boon Vintage Intrigue) - Elane Osborn</title>
      <meta name="description" content="
        &lt;p&gt;One minute she was &quot; Secondhand&quot; Rose Delancey, no one special, a woman driven by her dreams to a faraway home…&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;to meet the man of her imaginings. The next, everyone was calling her Anna, as in Anna &lt;em&gt;Benedict&lt;/em&gt;, troubled daughter of the political powerhouse Benedicts. A woman who was her spitting image. A woman who had a special relationship with her dream lover….&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Logan Maguire&#39; s job was to troubleshoot for the Benedicts. But Rose was one fire he didn&#39; t want to extinguish. Though she bore an uncanny resemblance to his missing surrogate sister, Logan&#39; s feelings for Rose were far from brotherly. And now this mystery lady was his only link to finding Anna…and, perhaps, to finding ever-elusive love….&lt;/p&gt;
