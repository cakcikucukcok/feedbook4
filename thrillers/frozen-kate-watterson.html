  <title>Frozen - Kate Watterson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;In Kate Watterson&#39;s thrilling suspense novel &lt;i&gt;Frozen&lt;/i&gt;, a small town detective races to catch a serial killer before another  woman is taken, and shockingly finds herself trying to prove the main  suspect&#39;s innocence.  &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bryce Grantham wants a quiet vacation at his family&#39;s cabin. On his first night in town, he meets a lovely girl at a bar and gives her a ride home. The next day, he finds her cell phone in his car. When he tries to return it, Bryce discovers that the young woman has vanished, leaving behind only a bloody shoe.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Suddenly Bryce Grantham is the primary suspect in a murder investigation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Detective Ellie MacIntosch has a serial killer on her hands, but without a body, she has few leads and the stalled investigation has her on edge. Bryce Grantham seems to be the perfect suspect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eighteen months have gone by without a clue, and yet Grantham starts reporting stumbling across the bodies of the missing women with unbelievable frequency. The evidence against him is almost irrefutable...but Ellie&#39;s gut tells her the case is not so cut and dry. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before Ellie compromises the investigation, her career, and possibly her life in order to prove Bryce&#39;s innocence, she must determine whether he is a manipulative, cold-blooded killer...or the victim of a madman playing a sickening game.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the Publisher&#39;s request, this title is being sold without Digital Rights Management Software (DRM) applied.&lt;/p&gt;" />
