  <title>Ghost Brother - Harry Guyer Jr.</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Two brothers share adventures and a bond that not even death can break in Ghost Brother, a collection of outdoor tales of the supernatural by award-winning writer Harry Guyer Jr. Youll meet the old man, his ghostly brother Roy, and Roys little ghost dog Queenie as they ramble through the woods and along the streams of southcentral Pennsylvania. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Youll also encounter an old man plodding along what may be his final trail, a bowhunter who channels spirits of archers of the past, another who performs an act of kindness for a departed soul, a young girl who races for her life in colonial times, and other unforgettable characters. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Along the way youll learn such outdoor skills as catching suckers, carving walking sticks, finding mushrooms, calling squirrels, building turkey calls, cleaning snapping turtles, and other useful lore. Youll also get a taste of rural Pennsylvania of over a half century ago and even discover the best way to deal with a bully. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of the stories are based on actual events with a supernatural twist added. Suspend your  disbelief for a few hours to enjoy Ghost Brother. &lt;/p&gt;" />
