  <title>Ever Present Danger - C S Peters</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&quot;Ever Present Danger&quot; is the second part of the Graham family saga. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is now early 1942 and finds James Graham coming to terms with his new individual role in the Second World War. A role, like his first as a Fighter Pilot, with its immense inherent risks and dangers. This time, though, the risks and danger come from his work as an SOE operative behind enemy lines in occupied Europe, where there are constant, fatal risks both to himself and others either working for the French Resistance or Evasion and Escape Lines in their desperate attempts to thwart the terrible endeavours of the occupying German forces and Gestapo. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jame&#39;s brother Colin is now also embroiled in the horrors of the War as captain of the Lancaster bomber, just one of many aircrew, who night after night, take off on missions to bring the War to a close. In so doing, he sees mass destruction and tragedy not only to those comrades around him in Bomber Command but, also, thousands of feet below in occupied territory. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Events arise which see both brother&#39;s lives once more threatened and unknowingly entwined and with their fates and those of their family forever sealed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Ever Present Danger&quot; is full of suspense, shock and thrills and leads to outcomes that no one in the Graham family could ever predict.&lt;/p&gt;" />
