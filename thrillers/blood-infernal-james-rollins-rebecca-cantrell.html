  <title>Blood Infernal - James Rollins, Rebecca Cantrell</title>

It will take the light of all three to forge the Chalice anew and banish him again to his eternal darkness.&lt;/em&gt; With the Apocalypse looming, Erin must again join forces with Army Sergeant Jordan Stone and Father Rhun Korza to search for a treasure lost for millennia.

All the while, they are hunted, besieged by creatures of uncanny skill and talent. As clues are dug free from ancient underground chapels and found frozen in icy mountain caverns, one that will destroy not only her, but all she loves.

And now, in this epic conclusion to the Sanguines trilogy, &lt;em&gt;Blood Infernal&lt;/em&gt;, they take us to the very pit of Hell itself, making us peer into the abyss and face our greatest fears, to answer the ultimate question: &lt;em&gt;What price will we pay for true salvation?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />
