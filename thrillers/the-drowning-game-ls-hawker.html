She can disarm, dismember, and kill&amp;#8212;and now, for the first time ever, she is free.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Her paranoid father is dead, his extreme dominance and rules a thing of the past, but his influence remains as strong as ever. When his final will reveals a future more terrible than her captive past, Petty knows she must escape&amp;#8212;by whatever means necessary.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But when Petty learns the truth behind her father&amp;#39;s madness&amp;#8212;and her own family&amp;#8212;the reality is worse than anything she could have imagined. On the road and in over her head, Petty&amp;#39;s fight for her life has just begun.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fans of female-powered thrillers will love debut author LS Hawker and her suspenseful tale of a young woman on the run for her future&amp;#8230;and from the nightmares of her past.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />
