  <title>All the Beautiful Lies - Peter Swanson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;From the acclaimed author of &lt;em&gt;Her Every Fear&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;The Kind Worth Killing&lt;/em&gt; comes a diabolically clever tale of obsession, revenge, and cold-blooded murder&amp;#8212;a sly and brilliant guessing game of a novel in the vein of Ruth Ware, Paula Hawkins, and Patricia Highsmith.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;p&gt;Harry Ackerson has always considered his stepmother Alice to be sexy and beautiful, in an &quot;otherworldly&quot; way. She has always been kind and attentive, if a little aloof in the last few years. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Days before his college graduation, Alice calls with shocking news. His father is dead and the police think it&amp;#8217;s suicide. Devastated, Harry returns to his father&amp;#8217;s home in Maine. There, he and Alice will help each other pick up of the pieces of their lives and uncover what happened to his father.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shortly after he arrives, Harry meets a mysterious young woman named Grace McGowan. Though she claims to be new to the area, Harry begins to suspect that Grace may not be a complete stranger to his family. But she isn&amp;#8217;t the only attractive woman taking an interest in Harry. The sensual Alice is also growing closer, coming on to him in an enticing, clearly sexual way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mesmerized by these two women, Harry finds himself falling deeper under their spell. Yet the closer he gets to them, the more isolated he feels, disoriented by a growing fear that both women are hiding dangerous&amp;#8212;even deadly&amp;#8212;secrets . . . and that neither one is telling the truth. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#12288;&lt;/p&gt;" />
