  <title>The Mosquito War - V. A. MacAlister</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;They were so close to a cure. And no one cared. Why should they?  Americans would not care about malaria until their own children woke screaming with the fever, until they started burying small caskets in their own country. Su Thom picked up the flask. It was only a tiny sample, but it wouldn&#39;t be hard to culture. The idea was so simple. So horrible. So perfect. Americans did not care about anything until it was a threat to their own people. Well then . . . that could be arranged.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Mosquito War &lt;/i&gt;is a fast-paced thriller with crooked pharmaceutical companies, a CIA plot gone horribly awry, and a terrorist weapon that comes in a very small package. When combined, these elements produce a deadly force that one grief-stricken scientist is determined to unleash on the American people to make them pay for their indifference to the plight of Third World suffering. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Who will try to stop him? Conor Gale, a world-weary young man who has more pride than sense, and Zee Aspen, a beautiful scientist working on aquatic medical research that might hold the key to the whole puzzle. Thrown together, mistrustful, but believing that the devil you know somewhat is better than the hordes of unknown bad guys who are definitely out to get you, they will have to work fast or an epidemic, unparalleled in our history, will spread this nation . . . and millions will die.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;At the Publisher&#39;s request, this title is being sold without Digital Rights Management Software (DRM) applied.&lt;/p&gt;" />
