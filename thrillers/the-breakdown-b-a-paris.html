It was on the winding rural road, in the middle of a downpour, and a woman was sitting inside--the woman who was killed. She&#39;s been trying to put the crime out of her mind; what could she have done, really? It&#39;s a dangerous road to be on in the middle of a storm, and she probably would have been hurt herself if she&#39;d stopped. Not only that, her husband would be furious if he knew she&#39;d broken her promise not to take that shortcut home.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But since then, she&#39;s been forgetting every little thing. Where she left the car; if she took her pills; even the alarm code.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The only thing she can&#39;t forget is that woman, the woman she might have saved, and the terrible nagging guilt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And the silent calls she&#39;s receiving, or the feeling that someone&#39;s watching her...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You won&#39;t be able to put down B. A. Paris&#39;s The Breakdown, the next chilling, propulsive novel from the New York Times and USA Today bestselling author of Behind Closed Doors.&lt;/p&gt;" />
