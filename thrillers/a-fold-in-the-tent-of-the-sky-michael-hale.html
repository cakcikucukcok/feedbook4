  <title>A Fold in the Tent of the Sky - Michael Hale</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Struggling actor Peter Abbott is about to land the biggest role of his life. His audition for Calliope Associates&amp;#8212;a clandestine private investigation firm made up of men and women with highly developed psychic abilities&amp;#8212;requires only proof of Peter&#39;s psychic skills, no dramatic monologue. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Business is booming until members of the group begin disappearing at the hands of fellow psychic Simon Haywood. His genius is matched only by Peter&#39;s, but Simon alone discovers a unique way to use his extrasensory skills to travel back in time, committing crimes without any trace. Simon&#39;s mind grows warped and paranoid as the universe strains against his tinkering. Terrified that his extracurricular voyages will be curtailed, he plans to &quot;erase&quot; his colleagues. But Simon&#39;s methods are not exactly cold-blooded; instead he goes back to the moment of his victims&#39; conception and prevents them from being created. Because no one in the present day recalls he or she ever existed, he&#39;s not caught . . . until Peter realizes what&#39;s happening. Now time is running out as Simon&#39;s sociopathic travels are disrupting the universe, folding and twisting the constraints of matter to a near-breaking point and threatening to spin the entire cosmos out of control. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A Fold in the Tent of the Sky&lt;/em&gt; takes murder into a new dimension as it races toward its electrifying, time-twisting climax.&lt;/p&gt;" />
