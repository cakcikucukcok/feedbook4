  <title>The Advocate&#39;s Daughter - Anthony Franze</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;A  Washington, D.C. lawyer and a frequent major media commentator on the  Supreme Court, Anthony Franze delivers a high-stakes story of family,  power, loss and revenge set within the insular world of the highest  court of our country.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among Washington D.C. power players,  everyone has secrets they desperately want to keep hidden, including  Sean Serrat, a Supreme Court lawyer. Sean transformed his misspent youth  into a model adulthood, and now has one of the most respected legal  careers in the country.  But just as he learns he&#39;s on the short list to  be nominated to the U.S. Supreme Court, his daughter, Abby, a talented  and dedicated law student, goes missing.  Abby&#39;s lifeless body is soon  found in the library of the Supreme Court, and her boyfriend, Malik  Montgomery, a law clerk at the high court, is immediately arrested.  The  ensuing media frenzy leads to allegations that Malik&#39;s arrest was  racially motivated, sparking a national controversy. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the  Serrat family works through their grief, Sean begins to suspect the  authorities arrested the wrong person.  Delving into the mysteries of  his daughter&#39;s last days, Sean stumbles over secrets within his own  family as well as the lies of some of the most powerful people in the  country. People who will stop at nothing to ensure that Sean never  exposes the truth.&lt;/p&gt;" />
