  <title>Gun Metal Heart - Dana Haynes</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;In &lt;i&gt;Gun Metal Heart &lt;/i&gt;by Dana Haynes, Daria Gibron, a freelance operative with a long and deadly history, has been slowly recovering from the injuries sustained from her last case. Hiding out in a town in rural Italy, she has been staying as far off the map as she can--until she&#39;s tracked down by an old colleague. Diego had been a bodyguard in Florence, protecting an engineer and her invention, when they were attacked by a highly trained paramilitary group. Diego alone escaped and the White Scorpions, a Serbian mercenary group known for their indiscriminate violence, are now after him. Well, after him and Daria, now that he&#39;s dragged her into the picture. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the same time, a small group of disgraced CIA agents have been waiting for their chance to exact revenge on the person they blame for their discharge--Daria Gibron. When they learn she&#39;s in contact with Diego, they get the okay from their former bosses to take her out. With several highly trained teams out to get her, a partner withholding critical information, and a missing invention around which everything turns, Daria is in the worst danger of her life. And she couldn&#39;t be having more fun.&lt;/p&gt;" />
