  <title>Eyes of the Insane - Eric Vik</title>
      <meta name="description" content="8 Friends get together to go on an expedition in the mountains of Norway to learn more about the habits of the scandinavian wolves. One of them comes across a map with some frightening notes writen on it. The notes indicate that there are Trolls in that mountain area and they are far from how they are described in Norwegian fairytales. The notes discribe them as blood thirsty predetors. The friends start disapearing one after the other and they soon find out that they are being hunted.
The soul survivor of the Expedition is locked away in a psychiatric ward because the authorities think he is the murderer but they dont have any evidence to get him convicted and put in jail. He tells his tale and soon reviels that he has done much more that the police would be interested in. He is Europes most wanted criminal but no one knows who he is until his confession was published by a student that he convinces to help him. The reason for his confession turns out to be his broken heart. Broken because one of his victims was his girlfriend that he killed unintentionally.
After confessing to many unsolved murders and murders that the police didn&#39;t even know occured he goes back and tells the true story of what happen to the 8 friends on their expedition." />
