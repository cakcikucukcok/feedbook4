  <title>The Darwin Strain - Bill Schutt, J. R. Finch</title>

Invaluable in defeating the Nazis, accidental crypto-zoologist R. J. MacCready and Yanni Thorne, an indigenous Brazilian and expert in animal behavior, are working for the Pentagon once again. Sent to a mysterious Greek island in a remote corner of the Mediterranean, they are investigating rumors about a volcanic spring with &amp;#8220;miraculous&amp;#8221; healing properties that the locals say is guarded by sea monsters from ancient legends.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The islanders believe that, like Fatima, the spring is a gift from God.

Mutating at an astonishing pace, the Kraken have evolved into a chillingly high alien intelligence. As the race to possess the &amp;#8220;miracle&amp;#8221; microbe heats up, tensions between geopolitics, religion, and ordinary scientists confronted with the unknown escalate into chaos. Mac and Yanni know all too well that one wrong choice can easily set in motion a biological chain reaction that will reach across the decades to enhance&amp;#8212;or destroy&amp;#8212;everything that lives.&lt;/p&gt;" />
