  <title>The Reincarnationist (Mills &amp; Boon M&amp;B) - M. J. Rose</title>
      <meta name="description" content="
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;A bomb in Rome, a flash of bluish-white light, and photojournalist Josh Ryder&#39;s world exploded. From that instant nothing would ever be the same.&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;As Josh recovers, his mind is increasingly invaded with thoughts that have the emotion, the intensity, the intimacy of memories. But they are not his memories. They are ancient– and violent. A battery of medical and psychological tests can&#39;t explain Josh&#39;s baffling symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;And the memories have an urgency he can&#39;t ignore– pulling him to save a woman named Sabina– and the treasures she is protecting. But who is Sabina? Desperate for answers, Josh turns to the world-renowned Phoenix Foundation– a research facility that scientifically documents cases of past life experiences.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;His findings there lead him to an archaeological dig and to Professor Gabriella Chase, who has discovered an ancient tomb– a tomb with a powerful secret that threatens to merge the past with the present. Here, the dead call out to the living, and murders of the past become murders of the present.&lt;/p&gt;
