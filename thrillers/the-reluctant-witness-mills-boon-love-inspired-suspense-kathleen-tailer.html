        &lt;p&gt;When his partner turns on him and tries to kill him, FBI agent Jack Mitchell is framed for murder and abandoned…&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;until a blue-eyed beauty saves his life. Even in his wounded haze Jack sees Casey Johnson is hiding a secret. As the only witness to his innocence, Jack needs her. But Casey doesn&#39;t know who&#39;s more dangerous–the man who wants Jack dead or the handsome agent himself. For if Jack knew the reason she escaped to the wilderness with her niece, he’d have to arrest her. But on the run with Jack, Casey realizes more than her secret is at stake now. So is her heart….&lt;/p&gt;
