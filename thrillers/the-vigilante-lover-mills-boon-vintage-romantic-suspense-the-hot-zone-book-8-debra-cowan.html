  <title>The Vigilante Lover (Mills &amp; Boon Vintage Romantic Suspense) (The Hot Zone, Book 8) - Debra Cowan</title>
      <meta name="description" content="
        &lt;p&gt;Firefighter Walker McClain was, hands-down, the sexiest, most affecting suspect that undercover investigator Jen Lawson had ever been assigned. But she hadn&#39;t come to Station Three to fall into bed with McClain. She was there to find out if he was a dangerous vigilante–the Payback Killer.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Walker knew better than to get involved with his new SWAT partner. But she awakened feelings he thought had long since turned to ash after his wife&#39;s brutal murder. And as their attraction heated up, so did the killer&#39;s deadly plan. The question was, just how deep did Walker&#39;s obsession with justice go?&lt;/p&gt;
