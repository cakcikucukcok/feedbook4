  <title>Caught in the Ack - Tom Lonergan</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&quot;Not exactly what I had in mind for the twilight of my mediocre career.&quot; This is Mike Quinns thinking when the hardboiled Nantucket police chief finds himself enmeshed in a mid-summer crime spree that quickly escalates from the disappearance of a vacationing child to a full blown terrorist threat against the President of the United States.
Wrestling with old demons, Quinn detectives his way forward from the retrieval of the lost child to the discovery of hidden island bunkers, caches of jet fuel and heat-treated rocket parts. Despite his best efforts at maintaining mid-summer normalcy, however, the Chief soon sees his island overrun by an army of vigilantes, federal agents and quirky island rats.
While Special Agent Cynthia Quinn, the Chiefs ex-wife, arrives from Washington to open as many old wounds as possible and young Agent Chloe Chigas appears to inspire and help, Quinn is ensnared in new love with bad-girl-turned-good ex-con Andie King. And displaying the deep pockets and bitter resolve to avenge his lost daughter, international businessman Joe Black adds to the chaos by bringing to the island every gun-slinging Rambo his credit card will buy." />
