It is the first in a series on the dark and clandestine underside of globalization and announces a compelling new voice in contemporary crime writing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The worlds of business, politics and crime collide when two men with the same name, from the same family, die on the same night--one death is a gangland murder, the other, apparently, a road accident.

But when a family member, Gina Rafferty, starts asking questions, this notion quickly unravels. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Devastated by her loss, Gina&#39;s grief is tempered, and increasingly fuelled, by anger--because the more she&#39;s told that it was all a coincidence, that gangland violence is commonplace, that people die on our roads every day of the week, the less she&#39;s prepared to accept it. Told repeatedly that she should stop asking questions, Gina becomes more determined than ever to find out the truth, to establish a connection between the two deaths--but in doing so she embarks on a path that will push certain powerful people to their limits...&lt;/p&gt;" />
