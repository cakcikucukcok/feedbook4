  <title>On Borrowed Time - David Rosenfelt</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;What if it were possible that your most cherished memories were lies... and that finding out the truth could cost you your life?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Richard Kilmer is head over heels in love with Jennifer Ryan, who takes him home to meet her parents, where she accepts his marriage proposal. While visiting, they set out on a nostalgic drive up to Kendrick Falls. On their way there, a freak storm rolls in, Richard loses control of his car, and it rolls. When the storm clears in a matter of seconds, Jen is gone. Richard can&#39;t find her, and neither can the police who respond to the scene. More horrifying is that no one in Richard&#39;s life will even confirm Jen&#39;s existence, and all traces of her have disappeared.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Where could she be? Has Richard lost his mind, or has something far worse happened?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;David Rosenfelt&#39;s &lt;i&gt;On Borrowed Time &lt;/i&gt;is a stunning new thriller about an ordinary man who is trapped in a nightmare where he can&#39;t be certain of anything--not even his own memories.&lt;/p&gt;" />
