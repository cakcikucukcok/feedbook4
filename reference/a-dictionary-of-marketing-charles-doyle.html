  <title>A Dictionary of Marketing - Charles Doyle</title>
      <meta name="description" content="A Dictionary of Marketing is an accessible and wide-ranging A-Z, providing over 2,500 entries on topics spanning terms for traditional marketing techniques (from strategy, positioning, segmentation, and branding, to all aspects of marketing planning, research, and analysis), as well as leading marketing theories and concepts. Both classic and modern marketing techniques are covered. Entries reflect modern changes in marketing practice, including the use of
digital and multi media, the impact of the World Wide Web on advertising, and the increased influence of social media and search engines on advertising and the rise of global brand management.
Also included is a time line of the development of marketing as a discipline and the key events that impacted the development, as well as over 100 relevant web links, accessed and updated via a companion website. In addition, the main appendix provides greater depth on the subject, including advertising and brand case studies with a strong international focus. These are arranged thematically, e.g. automobile industry, food and drink, luxury goods, and focus on iconic brands, marketing
campaigns, and slogans of the 20th century that have permeated our collective consciousness, exploring how the ideas defined in the main text of the book have been utilised successfully in practice across the globe. This dictionary is an indispensable resource for students of marketing and related
disciplines, as well as a practical guide for professional practitioners and people with a general interest in marketing." />
