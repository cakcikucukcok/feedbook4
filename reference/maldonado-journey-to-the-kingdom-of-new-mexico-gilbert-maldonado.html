  <title>Maldonado Journey to the Kingdom of New Mexico - Gilbert Maldonado</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Volume XI is a continuation of the journey of the Maldonado family to the Kingdom of New Mexico. It documents the Maldonado descendants of Pedro Gonzles de Carvajal and his wife Isabel Delgadillo. They are connected to New Mexico through the marriage of their second great-grandson, Juan de Vitoria Carvajal, to Isabel Holgun, daughter of Juan Lpez Holgun and Catalina de Villanueva, founders of the Kingdom of New Mexico. From the marriages of Juan and Isabels children, Magdalena, Juana, Agustn, Ana Mara, Gernimo, and Felis, don Pedro and doa Isabel became the ancestors of leading New Mexicans in later generations. Brothers Agustn and Gernimo de Carvajal married sisters Mara and Margarita Mrquez, daughters of Diego Mrquez and Bernardina Vsquez, a pioneering New Mexico couple. This volume contains not only their direct line of descent but also cousins, uncles, aunts, and in-laws. The Maldonado database has more than 5,800 names, with many of them represented here. The time period is generally from 1598 through the nineteenth century for most names, though the direct line continues to the present. Juan de VitoriaCarvajal is the ancestor of many people living in New Mexico today. In this volume his other descendants can trace their connections to cousins from this extended Maldonado family. Pedro Gonzles de Carvajal and Isabel Delgadillo are my thirteenth great-grandparents." />
