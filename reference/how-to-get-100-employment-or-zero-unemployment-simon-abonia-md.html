This book stresses the value of education in resolving the issue of unemployment and many other world problems. A good education, Job or FEM will add no extra cost to the individual, family, or government (Departments of Housing, Education, and Health) in United States, Mexico, Colombia. . . A good education for all children is the fundamental part, which is to triplicate the number of educators and duplicate the salary of all teachers and professors, forcing the department education budget to grow bigger every year, including the voluntarily savings in the Department of Education by all citizens, the book states.
With the help of everyone we will be able have Long Term Savings For All Through The Department of Education: it will allow more than 300 million Citizens to save Voluntarily and as much as possible at the Department of Education in order to help finance a Good Education for All, adding no extra cost to the government nor to the Individual or Family, therefore raising (Duplicating) the Salary of All Teachers and Professors, and at the same time Triplicate the number of Educators; forcing the Department Education Budget to grow bigger every year.
THESE   Long Term SAVINGS IN THE  Department of Education ARE FOR PAYMENT OF Educators SALARY ONLY.
There is no Poverty but Unemployment, A Good Education or jobs
stars before the child is born, all of them need F.E.M., which is A Good
Education or Jobs.
A Good Education, Jobs or F.E.M. is The Social Security
of ALL Children and the Youth (The Social Security
of All Workers), that guarantees A Good Education or Jobs for
ALL; Work or Housing (FAMILY-MORTGAGE or
SECURE-FAMILY-MORTGAGE) and Individual Health
Insurance (Medical and Dental) Paid at the Local Banks by All and for
a Lifetime, and without Extra cost to the Government, Family
or Individual; making our Present Social Security economically
safe and sound." />
