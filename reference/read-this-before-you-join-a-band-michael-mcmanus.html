  <title>Read This Before You Join a Band! - Michael McManus</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Every person who dreams of &quot;making it&quot; doesn&#39;t take into account the cold, harsh reality of the music business. Neither do parents, spouses, friends, and other influences, who are undoubtedly instrumental in helping them achieve their goals. During his career, Michael has had many triumphs, but not without hard lessons learned. His successes with international bands, tours, and recordings also came with failed record deals, false promises, and empty hopes (and pockets.) These are just a few of the struggles with which anyone in the music industry is all too familiar. 
Read This Before You Join a Band! is a very real look at the everyday life of a working musician. It is a personal tale of Michael&#39;s career - the highs and the lows - as he tells you what to capitalize on as well as what to avoid. Whether you&#39;re entering the music industry, or if you&#39;ve been in it for awhile, this book is a valuable resource in helping you prepare for -- and succeed -- in your career." />
