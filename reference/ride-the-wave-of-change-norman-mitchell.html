  <title>Ride the Wave of Change - Norman Mitchell</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Whether or not you like to surf, theres a lot you can learn about navigating change in your own life by applying lessons from those who ride the waves of the great blue sea.
Ocean surfers blend mental concentration with physical dexterity to become one with the wave. They combine incredible strength and balance with a laid-back attitude that lets them forget their wipeouts and look forward to riding the next wave. 
Norman Mitchell, an organizational psychologist with more than twenty-five years of experience as a management and performance consultant, delivers tips on using the same skills to embrace whatever waves come in your daily life. Learn how to:
	face unexpected changes and uncertainties with optimism and confidence;
	maintain a level head during times of transition and uncertainty;
	remain positive even when facing scary waves;
	overcome fears that come with formidable challenges.
Riding the waves of the oceanand lifecan be exciting, but if you arent flexible, responsive and courageous, the results can be disastrous. By learning from ocean surfers, youll be equipped to handle whatever changes and challenges come at you. I like this better as the keynote to grab someones attention. 
Ride the Wave of Change is a refreshing adventure that not only offers the reader sage advice but speaks directly to the core of ones desire for self-sufficiency.Margaret Mohr, management consultant" />
