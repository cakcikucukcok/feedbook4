  <title>The Fortney Encyclical Black History - Albert Fortney Jr.</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The Encyclical Black History has been created for the critical and lack of vital Afro-Centric
Multi-Curriculum text in urban school systems and is a necessity for African Americans. 
This book was created with careful and serious attention to biographical names that identifies 
history, culture as well as biblical characters.
     The reason why of this encyclical history can be explained with the facts and proof/evidence
of the following. The point that has socio-psychological implications at the unconscious as
well as the conscious level is the great little white racist lie, seen long enough, becomes the 
truth; like, portraying a white Jesus Christ who was a black man.
     Dr. Alvin Poussaint, a Black psychiatrist associated with Harvard University and others 
have observed and explained the most tragic part of all of this is that the African American 
has come to form his self image and self-concept on the basis of what white racists have
laid down as a guide or prescribed. Therefore, black men and women learn quickly to hate
themselves and each other more than their white oppressor. There is almost infinite evidence
that racism has left almost irreparable scars on the psyche of Afro-Americans that burden
with an unrelenting, painful anxiety that drives the psyche to reach out for a sense of 
identity and self-esteem.
     Poussaint and others say that black children, especially learn to hate themselves at  
very early ages. Studies reveal their preference for white dolls over black ones. One 
study reported that black children in their drawings tend to show blacks as small, 
incomplete people and whites as strong and powerful. To conclude, in western color
symbolism white is positive and black negative.
     Many people might ask why the contributions of Africa should be included in American
curriculum? Is because they bleach and still rob black history and culture with black pictured
as white that lie, leaves us mentally-dead, angry, and without purpose, of where we are going!
     Human culture is the product of all humanity, not the possession of a single racial or ethnic 
group. Afro-centric Multicultural educations major aim is to close the gap between Western 
ideals of equality, justice and practices that contradict these ideas. Stereotype people of color 
and people who are poor have just about no opportunities to become free of perspectives 
that are monoculture, that devalue African culture victimize them mostly having an inability 
to fully, function effectively in society. Many of these problems could be miraculously 
remedied with astonishing results if explained of black scientific achievements, which occurred 
in black Africa. There are also white African Americans living in the U.S.A. besides black 
African Americans, should make the distinction. 
     Carl Sandburg (1979) related a dialogue between a white American and an American Indian
which illustrates the need for multicultural education: The white man drew a small circle in the
sand and told the red man, This is what the Indian knows, and drawing a big circle around the
small one, this is what is what the white man knows. The Indian then took the stick and swept an
immensely big ring around both circles and said, this is where the white man and the red man 
knows nothing." />
