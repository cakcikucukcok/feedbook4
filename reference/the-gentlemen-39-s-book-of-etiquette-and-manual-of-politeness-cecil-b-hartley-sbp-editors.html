  <title>The Gentlemen&#39;s Book of Etiquette and Manual of Politeness - Cecil B. Hartley, Sbp Editors</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;This book provides rules for the etiquette to be observed in the street, at table, in the ball room, evening party, and morning call; with full directions for polite or respondence, dress, conversation, manly exercises, and accomplishments. Man was not intended to live like a bear or a hermit, apart from others of his own nature, and, philosophy and reason will each agree with me, that man was born for sociability and finds his true delight in society. Society is a word capable of many meanings, and used here in each and all of them. Society, par excellence; the world at large; the little clique to which he is bound by early ties; the companionship of friends or relatives; even society tete a tete with one dear sympathizing soul, are pleasant states for a man to be in. All in all this is a great book on etiquette. A great place to learn the rules of etiquette.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ABOUT THE AUTHOR:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Cecil B. Hartley&lt;/strong&gt; was a 19th-century biographer and etiquette expert. He is the author of The Gentleman&amp;#39;s Book of Etiquette, The Life and Times of Colonel Daniel Boone, and The Three Mrs. Judsons.&lt;/p&gt;" />
