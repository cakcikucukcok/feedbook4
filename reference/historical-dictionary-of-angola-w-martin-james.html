  <title>Historical Dictionary of Angola - W. Martin James</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Angola, slowly recovering from a twenty-seven year civil war, is becoming a regional super-power in southern Africa. This rise can be attributed to oil, diamonds, a battle-tested armed forces and a political system that is dominated by one party &amp;ndash; the Movimento Popular de Liberta&amp;ccedil;&amp;atilde;o de Angola (the Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola &amp;ndash; MPLA). Problems remain to be solved. The vast wealth is in the control of the elite while the vast majority of the people live on less than two dollars per day. Corruption is rife, the health and education system in shambles, landmines remain a festering problem and the opposition is intimidated and split into various factions. President Eduardo dos Santos, who has ruled Angola for almost thirty-eight years, has opted not to run for re-election in the August 2017 elections. Instead his hand-picked successor Jo&amp;atilde;o Louren&amp;ccedil;o was elected president. Interestingly, dos Santos has not surrendered his presidency of the party.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This third edition of &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-style:italic;&quot;&gt;Historical Dictionary of Angola&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; contains a chronology, an introduction, appendixes, and an extensive bibliography. The dictionary section has over 700 cross-referenced entries on important personalities, politics, economy, foreign relations, religion, and culture. This book is an excellent resource for students, researchers, and anyone wanting to know more about Angola.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;" />
