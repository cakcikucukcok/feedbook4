  <title>Talking Donkeys and Smashing Babies - Dr. Mara Hollis</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Are there two people more diametrically opposite than a conservative, evangelical minister and his progressive thinking, liberal daughter?   Dr. Hollis explains how she escaped the cult culture of the Free Will Baptist Doctrine and battled the martinets that were her father and mother.  Despite the well-intended beatings designed to beat the hell out she shares humorous family moments and the love of laughter that contributed to her survival.
During this de-programming journey, Dr. Hollis describes what she has learned about the dyke culture and explains why belief in the literal interpretation of the Bible - where donkeys talk to their masters, babies are smashed against rocks, and approval is given for slaves to be beaten within one inch of their lives - is so dangerous. 
Join Dr. Hollis as she takes you on a journey to find out why dykes hate weddings  and why Christians everywhere seem to be disobeying the teachings of Jesus." />
