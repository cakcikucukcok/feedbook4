  <title>The Quotable Chesterton - Kevin Belmonte</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;G. K. Chesterton was a literary giant of his age. With an exceptional intellect, he wrote about history, politics, economics, philosophy, social and literary criticism, and theology. He published essays, novels, biographies, short stories, and poetry, and the Christian classics &lt;i&gt;Heretics&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Orthodoxy&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;The Everlasting Man&lt;/i&gt;, which C. S. Lewis credits as instrumental in his conversion to Christianity.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;With much of his finest material out of print or hard to find, modern readers have long needed a standard collection of his best thoughts. Kevin Belmonte’s &lt;i&gt;The Quotable Chesterton&lt;/i&gt; brings them to you arranged alphabetically by topic, with complete original source documentation.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;There are entries from Adventure to Cheese, Politics to Émile Zola, interspersed with essays about Chesterton’s life and times. Hundreds of passages drawn from Chesterton’s fiction, poetry, essays, and other books showcase a man the &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; hailed as a “brilliant English essayist” and George Bernard Shaw called a “colossal genius.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Endorsements:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“There isn’t a writer who gets me pacing and smiling and thinking like G.K. Chesterton. His every paradigm shift is an adjustment to my mental compass, and so a gift.” —DONALD MILLER, author of the &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestsellers &lt;i&gt;A Million Miles in a Thousand Years&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Blue Like Jazz&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Over the years, I have delivered thousands of lectures, speeches, talks, and sermons; I have written hundreds of articles, essays, books, and reviews; it is an exceedingly rare occasion when any of them should fail to contain the words ‘Chesterton once said.’ Kevin Belmonte here reveals that fountain of wit, wisdom, and wonder, G.K. Chesterton, in all his irresistibly, irrepressibly, quotable splendor.”—GEORGE GRANT, Pastor, Parish Presbyterian Church, and Chancellor, New College Franklin&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />
