  <title>Captaincy for Advancing Bridge Players - Denis Klein</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Every Bridge player has heard the cliche that &#39;Bridge is a
partnership game&#39;. What does that actually mean? What is
expected of you? Or put more strongly, what are your
responsibilities from the very simple to the more difficult,
across a myriad of common Bidding and Defensive positions?
Captaincy for Advancing Bridge Players seeks to put
the under-organized and under-discussed area of Captaincy
squarely under the &#39;X&#39; that marks the spot on your favorite
pirate&#39;s map. There is plenty of bounty to be had for the
players that find the timely ways of how to provide or seek
information, and know just when it is time to make a critical
decision for the partnership. General Concepts are laid out
and related theory is discussed, that provide the foundation
for Advancing players to learn &#39;how to fish&#39; across many
different looking but related Bridge circumstances.
Innumerable example hands then progressively allow
you to quiz yourself. These hands are then analyzed in detail
so that as you experience the repeated application of these
fundamental Captaincy Concepts, your Bridge skills are
gradually both broadened and deepened. Having quiz hands
is a challenging and fun way to help you learn this very
challenging and fun game from your favorite armchair! So, do you do your fair share?
