  <title>The Gifted Boss: How to Find, Create and Keep Great Employees - Dale Dauten</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Want freedom from management, mediocrity and morons? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ever wonder what the best bosses know that you don&#39;t? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Do you want to have great employees, people who don&#39;t need to be managed and who make everyone around them work harder and raise the department to a higher standard? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Gifted Boss&lt;/em&gt; is management guru Dale Dauten&#39;s classic&amp;#8212;yet revolutionary&amp;#8212;guidebook on teaching managers how to spot and court talent and how to give great employees what they want and need. This is a comprehensive system full of valuable insight and lessons aimed at creating the best work environment for the best people. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Throughout &lt;em&gt;The Gifted Boss&lt;/em&gt;, Dale Dauten defines his different breed of leader as one who is able to shape a business environment and culture that is a magnet for self-motivated employees. Dauten&#39;s starting point is a powerful fact about hiring great employees: the best ones are almost never in the job market. His system also includes a discussion of &quot;ideal turnover&quot; and how the great managers employ &quot;the secret skill&quot; of &quot;de-hiring&quot; to gracefully move mediocre employees up or out. Throughout his discussions, Dauten incorporates priceless knowledge gained from an exhaustive search for America&#39;s best bosses. The wisdom he acquired was startling, and it pertained to every type of organization: &quot;Different isn&#39;t always better, but better is always different.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Gifted Boss&lt;/em&gt; has already earned itself a cult following. Now, based on conversations with hundreds of readers, Dauten has revised his work by adding a quick-start guide to help his audience get fast results and a discussion guide to help executives share the book with their teams. Though new technology continues to bring new changes to communication in the workplace, &lt;em&gt;The Gifted Boss&lt;/em&gt; still remains the essential guide to maneuvering the tricky world of managing the modern employee. It belongs on every businessperson&#39;s desk. &lt;/p&gt;" />
