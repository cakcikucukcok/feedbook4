  <title>Classic Wisdom for the Good Life - Bryan Curtis</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;The good&amp;nbsp; life. In its simplest form, it is what you wish for those you love and care about, as well as for yourself. But what is it? What&#39;s the prescription?&lt;/P&gt; &lt;P&gt;The truth of the matter is that no doctor can prescribe a pill that will make every heart content. But through the words of extraordinary men and women who have achieved a level of greatness, we can glean insights into passion, dedication, and wisdom.&lt;/P&gt; &lt;P&gt;So, for today&#39;s astute students of the good life, you hold in your hands an admit-one ticket?a timeless collection of inspiration and wisdom. What you go on to do with it is up to you.&lt;/P&gt; &lt;P&gt;&quot;A man who views the world the same at fifty as he did at twenty has wasted thirty years of his life.&quot; ?&lt;B&gt;Muhammad Ali&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/P&gt; &lt;P&gt;&quot;It&#39;s easy to make a buck. It&#39;s a lot tougher to make a difference.&quot; ?&lt;B&gt;Tom Brokaw&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/P&gt; &lt;P&gt;&quot;Look, I don&#39;t want to wax philosophic, but I will say that if you&#39;re alive you&#39;ve got to flap your arms and legs, you&#39;ve got to jump around a lot, for life is the very opposite of death, and therefore you must at very least think noisy and colorfully, or you&#39;re not alive.&quot; ?&lt;B&gt;Mel Brooks&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/P&gt; &lt;P&gt;&quot;Anytime you see a turtle up on top of a fence post, you know he had some help.&quot; ?&lt;B&gt;Alex Haley&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/P&gt; &lt;P&gt;&quot;College is something you complete. Life is something you experience. So don&#39;t worry about your grade, or the results or success. Success is defined in myriad ways, and you will find it, and people will no longr be grading you, but it will come from your own internal sense of decency.&quot; ?&lt;B&gt;Jon Stewart&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/P&gt; &lt;P&gt;&quot;When the heart is right, the mind and the body will follow. ?&lt;B&gt;Coretta Scott King&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/P&gt; &lt;P&gt;&quot;My heroes are the ones who survived doing it wrong, who made mistakes, but recovered from them. ?&lt;B&gt;Bono&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/P&gt;" />
