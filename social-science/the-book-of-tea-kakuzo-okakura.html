  <title>The Book of Tea - Kakuzo Okakura</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This book is written by Kakuzo Okakura about the concept of teaism and how tea has affected nearly every aspect of Japanese culture, thought, and life.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The writer himself has learnt English language since the young age and is proficient at it. So he took the chance to share his thoughts to the Western Mind.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
In this book, he also touch base on topics as Zen and Taoism, but also the secular aspects of Tea and Japanese life.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The book emphasises how Teaism taught the Japanese many things; most importantly, simplicity.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Kakuzo argues that this tea-induced simplicity affected art and architecture, and he was a long-time student of the visual arts.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
He ends the book with a chapter on Tea Masters, and spends some time talking about Sen no Rikyu and his contribution to the Japanese Tea Ceremony." />

It was authored by Okakura Kakuzo, a Japanese philosopher, art expert, and curator.<br /><b><i>The Book of Tea: Beauty, Simplicity and the Zen Aesthetic ...</i></b> | It is rare for writing as exquisite as Okakura's to be illustrated just as exquisitely and this Benjamin Press Edition of The Book of Tea is in its own right a landmark in the art of bookmaking. We look through Mr. Richarson's educated eye at period photos and portraits from the time Okakura at 24 sailed from Yohohama to San Francisco in 1886.<br /><p><h3 align="left">Download Ebook|PDF|Epub of <a href=>The Book of Tea - Kakuzo Okakura</a> </h3></p><hr/>
