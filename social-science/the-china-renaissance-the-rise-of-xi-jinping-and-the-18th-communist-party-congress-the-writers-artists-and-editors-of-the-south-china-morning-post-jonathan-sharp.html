  <title>The China Renaissance: The Rise of Xi Jinping and the 18th Communist Party Congress - the writers, artists and editors of the South China Morning Post, Jonathan Sharp</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Rising superpower China duly anointed a new generation of leaders led by Xi Jinping at the Communist Party&amp;#x0027;s 18th National Congress held in November 2012. While the conclave itself passed off with smoothly choreographed efficiency, the months leading up to this once-a-decade transition were anything but orderly. Intense factional wrangling behind the scenes was accompanied by scandals very much in public view. In the most spectacular furore the political aspirations of Communist aristocrat Bo Xilai were dashed, at one time threatening to derail the meticulous stage managing of the congress itself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the start of what turned out to be a tumultuous year, the &lt;i&gt;South China Morning Post&lt;/i&gt; set out on an ambitious project to chronicle the transfer of power to the so-called fifth generation of Chinese leaders, delving behind the cloak of secrecy that routinely masks Beijing&amp;#x0027;s corridors of power. The result was unparalleled coverage and a series of exclusives that kept the newspaper well ahead of its peers on this remarkable story.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the past decade saw China&amp;#x0027;s supercharged economy accelerate past Japan to become the world&amp;#x0027;s second-largest, the coming decade is expected to see China led by Xi and his team move towards catching up the United States as the world&amp;#x0027;s top economic force. Who are the people that will guide China through its challenges at home and on the global stage? By profiling dozens of rising stars as well as current movers and shakers, the SCMP has provided the most complete portrait to date of the leaders who will control the world&amp;#x0027;s most populous country over the next decade.
