  <title>A Yankee&#39;s Guide to Surviving Life in the South and a Southerner’S Guide to Surviving Life with Those Damn Yankees - Kate Dyer</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Kate Dyer is a Yankee, Boston-born and bred. Shes a lawyer by trade, on the wrong side of fifty, blunt, irreverent, and opinionated. Shes what Southerners might colorfully call contrary. Through an uninteresting twist of events, shes built a new life south of the Mason-Dixon Lineand shes having the time of her life doing it! As any successful lawyer must be, shes also a keen and astute observer of the human species. That makes her a bit of an amateur anthropologist who is eager to share her tongue-in-cheek observations. Here, to help fellow Yankees who share her newfound love of the South, she shares her best tips for fitting in with the locals. And for all those Southerners who just cant figure out those Yankees who have moved in, shes got a few tips as well. 
She offers some tongue-in-cheek guidance in how to decode regional vocabulary from both sides. And as an ingenious Yankee, she has a lot to say about good old-fashioned Yankee ingenuity. Youll also enjoy a culinary passport to the flavors of her childhood in Boston as well as her adopted Tennessee home, with dozens of recipes that showcaseand celebratethe flavors of each region. 
A Taste of the North (or, A Little Yankee Home Cooking)
