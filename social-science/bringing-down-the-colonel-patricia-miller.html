  <title>Bringing Down the Colonel - Patricia Miller</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&quot;I&#39;ll take my share of the blame. I only ask that he take his.&quot;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In &lt;i&gt;Bringing Down the Colonel&lt;/i&gt;, the journalist Patricia Miller tells the story of Madeline Pollard, an unlikely nineteenth-century women&#39;s rights crusader. After an affair with a prominent politician left her &quot;ruined,&quot; Pollard brought the man--and the hypocrisy of America&#39;s control of women&#39;s sexuality--to trial. And, surprisingly, she won.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pollard and the married Colonel Breckinridge began their decade-long affair when she was just a teenager. After the death of his wife, Breckinridge asked for Pollard&#39;s hand--and then broke off the engagement to marry &lt;i&gt;another&lt;/i&gt; woman. But Pollard struck back, suing Breckinridge for breach of promise in a shockingly public trial. With premarital sex considered irredeemably ruinous for a woman, Pollard was asserting the unthinkable: that the sexual morality of men and women should be judged equally.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Nearly 125 years after the Breckinridge-Pollard scandal, America is still obsessed with women&#39;s sexual morality. And in the age of Donald Trump and Harvey Weinstein, we&#39;ve witnessed fraught public reckonings with a type of sexual exploitation unnervingly similar to that experienced by Pollard. Using newspaper articles, personal journals, previously unpublished autobiographies, and letters, &lt;i&gt;Bringing Down the Colonel &lt;/i&gt;tells the story of one of the earliest women to publicly fight back.&lt;/p&gt;" />
