  <title>Chevy Nova 1968-1974: How to Build and Modify - Wayne Scraba</title>
      <meta name="description" content="There was a time when the Chevrolet Nova was considered a budget option, a model engineered primarily for the price-conscious customer. Certainly performance models were already in Chevrolet&#39;s fold. With the Camaro, the Corvette, and the Chevelle leading the way, why would Chevy need another performance model? Well, savvy Chevy customers knew that you could get a really tricked-out Nova right from the factory with SS packages and big-block 396 engines along with performance transmissions and gearing for a fair amount less than an equally equipped Camaro. As a bonus, Novas were lighter weight too. It was the performance bargain of the Chevy lineup.&lt;p&gt;Fast forward to today. The first-generation Camaros cost a small fortune, and while Novas have held their value quite well, they are still a performance bargain compared to the other Chevy performance models of the era. Not only are they more affordable than Camaros, but you can do a whole lot to make them really fast. In &lt;i&gt;Chevy Nova 1968-1974: How to Build and Modify&lt;/i&gt;, veteran author and Chevy expert Wayne Scraba shows you all you need to know to build a killer street or strip Nova. Included is detailed information on driveline upgrades, rear-suspension options for the ultimate hook, front-end suspension and chassis components for good handling and weight transfer, excellent brake upgrades, engine swap options, cooling system upgrades, and more.&lt;p&gt;Focusing on quarter-mile performance, Scraba expertly covers all of your options for a strong-running street Nova, a street-strip combo package, or all-out drag racing options. If you want to build your Nova into a quarter-mile warrior, this book is an essential tool for success." />
