  <title>Whiteshift - Eric Kaufmann</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;B&gt;Whiteshift: the turbulent journey from a world of racially homogeneous white majorities to one of racially hybrid majorities&lt;/B&gt;&lt;BR /&gt; &amp;nbsp;&lt;BR /&gt; This is the century of whiteshift. As Western societies are becoming increasingly mixed-race, demographic change is transforming politics. Over half of American babies are non-white, and by the end of the century, minorities and those of mixed race are projected to form the majority in the UK and other countries. The early stages of this transformation have led to a populist disruption, tearing a path through the usual politics of left and right. Ethnic transformation will continue, but conservative whites are unlikely to exit quietly; their feelings of alienation are already redrawing political lines and convulsing societies across the West. One of the most crucial challenges of our time is to enable conservatives as well as cosmopolitans to view whiteshift as a positive development.&lt;BR /&gt; &amp;nbsp;&lt;BR /&gt; In this groundbreaking book, political scientist Eric Kaufmann examines the evidence to explore ethnic change in North American and Western Europe. Tracing four ways of dealing with this transformation&amp;mdash;fight, repress, flight, and join&amp;mdash;he charts different scenarios and calls for us to move beyond empty talk about national identity. If we want to avoid more radical political divisions, he argues, we have to open up debate about the future of white majorities.&lt;BR /&gt; &amp;nbsp;&lt;BR /&gt; Deeply thought provoking, enriched with illustrative stories, and drawing on detailed and extraordinary survey, demographic, and electoral data, &lt;I&gt;Whiteshift&lt;/I&gt; will redefine the way we discuss race in the twenty-first century.&lt;BR /&gt; &amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;" />
