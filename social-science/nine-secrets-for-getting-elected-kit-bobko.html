  <title>Nine Secrets for Getting Elected - Kit Bobko</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;You&amp;rsquo;re thinking about running for election, but you aren&amp;rsquo;t sure how to begin. You want to get involved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Maybe the thing that finally pushed you into politics was small, such as another $65 parking ticket or a city ordinance that bans selling ice cream cones at your new business. Or maybe it&amp;rsquo;s something big, like the daily turmoil currently churning Washington, D.C. The national leadership is driving you crazy; or maybe you believe it&amp;rsquo;s not being nearly aggressive enough.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whatever it is, you&amp;rsquo;ve decided it&amp;rsquo;s time to run for office. But are you ready?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
	&lt;ul&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;ul&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;Are you ready to raise the money you need to win?&lt;/li&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;Are you prepared to deal with the special interests, political factions, and gadflies that exist in every political arena?&lt;/li&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;Do you have a compelling message? Have you figured out why exactly you want to run and are you able to explain why constituents should give you their vote?&lt;/li&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;Do the voters in your district know you? If not, how do you gain the name recognition you need to win your race?&lt;/li&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;Do you know how many votes you need to win? Do you know who those voters are?&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;What&amp;rsquo;s your game plan to deliver your message to your district&amp;rsquo;s voters?&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;/ul&gt;
		&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;/ul&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nine Secrets for Getting Elected&lt;/em&gt; shares the truth about politics with you. It&amp;rsquo;s about the things you need to know to run - &lt;em&gt;and win!&lt;/em&gt; - public office. It puts two-term Mayor and City Councilman Kit Bobko&amp;rsquo;s 20-years of political experience in your campaign&amp;rsquo;s corner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nine Secrets for Getting Elected&lt;/em&gt; is an unfiltered view of local politics from the campaign trail to serving on the city council and beyond. Kit walks you through planning, building the support you need to run, fundraising, and winning endorsements. He&amp;rsquo;ll guide you around the pitfalls of accepting the wrong kind of help. You&amp;rsquo;ll learn about the unseen&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nine Secrets for Getting Elected &lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;isn&amp;rsquo;t an Eighth grade Civics textbook. It&amp;rsquo;s where &lt;em&gt;House of Cards&lt;/em&gt; intersects with &lt;em&gt;Parks and Recreation&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s fun, it&amp;rsquo;s enlightening, and it will help you win your election.&lt;/p&gt;
