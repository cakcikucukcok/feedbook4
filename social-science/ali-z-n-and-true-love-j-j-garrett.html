  <title>Ali Zán and True Love - J J Garrett</title>
      <meta name="description" content="A scruffy Arabian colt of the mountainous Latin American outback is purchased
by North American Tracer Montrose the morning his wife, Constance, angrily
packs to leave him. The horse being a gift that Constance cannot check for
her flight home, she delays her departure. She names him Ali Zn?and soon
encounters a herd of his kin fleeing a highland inferno. Tracer unites equestrian
club riders and dirt-roughened cowboys to save the animals. The mismatched
bunch form a trail riding club. Meanwhile, the purchase of Napoleon and
True Love causes a cramp in Ali Zns stable space. These older horses are
bright and abrasive, strong and fearless, and champion the outback equine
during nerve-wracking jumps, turns, and races. Tracer and Constance, rider
novices, persist upon the backs of their steeds within the club arena and along
the outback abyss, as well. But their horses poorly manage long-pent demands
to achieve maddened equine goals. Their competitive spirits turn upon them.
They find that neither rider nor trail obstruct them; that their devils must be
accosted elsewhere. The youthful Ali Zn interprets this heart-rending tale by
which horse and human are ridden, driven, and, sometimes, bound." />
