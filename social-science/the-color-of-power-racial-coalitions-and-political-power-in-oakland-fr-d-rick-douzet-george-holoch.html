  <title>The Color of Power: Racial Coalitions and Political Power in Oakland - Frédérick Douzet, George Holoch</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;i&gt;The Color of Power &lt;/i&gt;is a fascinating examination of     the changing politics of race in Oakland, California. Oakland has been at the forefront of     California&#39;s multicultural changes for decades. Since the 1960s, the city has been a     shining example of a fruitful liberal black-and-white political partnership and the successful     incorporation of black politicians into the political landscape. But over the past forty years,     the balance of power has changed as a consequence of dramatic demographic trends and economic     circumstances. The city&#39;s formerly dominant biracial political machine has been challenged     by the demands of new multiracial interests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The city, once     governed by a succession of black mayors and majority black city councils, must now accommodate     rapidly growing Asian and Latino communities. While the black-led coalition still relies on     white progressive support, this alliance has weakened due to a shift in the progressives&#39;     agenda and the voting habits of the black community, the rise of a Hispanic-Asian coalition, and     a strong demographic decline of the African American population. With similar demographic     changes taking place across the nation, Oakland&#39;s experience provides insight in to the     multiracial future of other American cities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;i&gt;The     Color of Power&lt;/i&gt; investigates Oakland&#39;s contemporary racial politics with a     detailed study of conflicts over issues like education, elections and political representation,     and crime. Trained as a journalist, a political scientist, and a geographer, the author provides     a unique perspective supported by numerous maps and extensive     interviews.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Winner of awards from the French Society of Geography and     the French National Academy of Sciences&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />
