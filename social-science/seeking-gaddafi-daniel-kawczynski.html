  <title>Seeking Gaddafi - Daniel Kawczynski</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;On 18th March 2011 the United Nations passed Resolution 1973 allowing the establishment of a No Fly Zone above the towns and cities of Libya to defend civilians from the oppressive regime of Colonel Muammar Gaddafi. With NATO planes now patrolling the skies over Libya&#39;s main cities, the country faces an uncertain future: Revolution? Civil War? Partition? Only one man holds the answer, and he is not going to give up power easily.&amp;amp;#160; Seeking Gaddafi is a fascinating portrait of one of the most controversial figures in modern history. Gaddafi has, for four decades, been absolute ruler of Libya, a country where basic civil iberties are virtually nonexistent, and opposition not tolerated. For much of his reign he has been implicated in subversion and terrorist activities throughout the world and regarded as a patron of international terrorism. Of late, he had been seeking a more open relationship with the West, a courtship that ended abruptly with the events of spring 2011. As the UK is drawn into yet another overseas conflict, Daniel Kawczynski, advisor on Libyan affairs to William Hague&#39;s Foreign Office team, examines the persona and career of one of the world&#39;s most enigmatic and bizarre leaders and looks at what it would take to unseat him, and what happens next.&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;" />
