      <meta name="description" content="When he arrived Jan prepared her table, put on some relaxing music and lit some scented candles making a very relaxing atmosphere. She gave the guy a towel and told him to strip as she didn&#39;t want any of the oils getting onto his clothes. He was slightly overweight and had a big hairy beer belly and a very hairy back, Jan didn&#39;t like this but it was her job now so she has to deal with many different body types so she just got on with it. She told the guy to climb onto the table and lay on his stomach then she stood beside the table and started rubbing the oil into his neck and worked her way down his back, she could feel the tension in his back and worked on that area making the guy wince;    &quot;Arrrgh, that&#39;s the spot right there&quot; he said gritting his teeth.    Jan continued to gently massage him and as she did she could feel the tension easing in his back and he was now sighing rather than wincing as the massage became more pleasurable;" />
