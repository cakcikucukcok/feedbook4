  <title>Reassembling the Strange - Thomas Anderson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;This book examines how Westerners understood and processed Madagascar and its environment during the nineteenth century. Madagascar&amp;rsquo;s unique ecosystem crafted its reputation as a strange place full of unusual species. Westerners, however, often minimized Madagascar&amp;rsquo;s peculiar features to stress the commonality of its fauna and flora with the world. The attempt to understand the island through science led to a domestication of its environment that created the image of a tame and known world capable of being controlled and used by Western powers. At the heart of the exploration of Madagascar and its transformation in Western eyes from a strange world to a cash crop colony were missionaries and naturalists who relied upon global experiences to master the island by normalizing the peculiar qualities of Madagascar&amp;rsquo;s environment. This book reveals how the environment played a dominant role in understanding the island and its people, and how current environmental debates have evolved from earlier policies and discussions about the environment. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />
