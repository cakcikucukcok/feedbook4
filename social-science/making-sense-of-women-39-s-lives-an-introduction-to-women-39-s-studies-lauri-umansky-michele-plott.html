      <meta name="description" content="&lt;i&gt;Making Sense of Women&#39;s Lives&lt;/i&gt; presents a wide range of writings about women&#39;s lives in the United States. Michele Plott and Lauri Umansky have drawn on their experiences as both students and professors to assemble the collection. Seeking to provide as full a sampling from a diverse and intellectually vibrant field as one volume permits, the editors have also chosen writing that makes an enjoyable read. A few of the selections here represent the undisputed &#39;classics&#39; of the field. More of them constitute simply the works, drawn from academic and nonacademic sources alike, that could make a difference in understanding what it means to be female in America." />
