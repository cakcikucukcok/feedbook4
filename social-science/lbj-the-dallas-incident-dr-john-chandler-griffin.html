  <title>Lbj the Dallas Incident - Dr. John Chandler Griffin</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The Kennedy Incident
November 22, 2013  will mark the 50th anniversary of the greatest crime ever committed in this great nation, the assassination of John F. Kennedy, the president of the United States. Then, two days later the man accused of having committed that crime, Lee Harvey Oswald, was also murdered, shot down in the Dallas Police Headquarters by mob thug Jack Ruby.
The nation was aghast. How could such things happen in 20th century America?
Ah, but not to worry. President Lyndon Baines Johnson immediately announced the appointment of a blue-ribbon committee, chaired by none other than the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court, Earl Warren, to discover just how such murders could have happened in Dallas, Texas in I963. Known as the Warren Commission, it was a committee whose judgment could not be questioned. But then a year later the WC issued its report (known as the Warren Commission Report) and almost immediately citizens from one end of the country to the other were yelling questions-chard questions that insulted both the WC&#39;s judgment and its objectivity. As though that were not bad enough, A few months later a New York attorney, Mark Lane, hired by Oswald&#39;s mother to vindicate her son, published his myth-shattering book, Rush To Judgment. The Warren Commission was blown out of the water.
But still no satisfactory answers were forthcoming. Lyndon Baines Johnson and his political sycophants were very happy to blame Oswald for the entire tragedy. Anyone but themselves.
Then in New Orleans rose a new challenge. District Attorney Jim Garrison began his investigation into the murders. But again the Federal Government reared its ugly head. State governors across the nation were advised to ignore subpoenas to testify in Garrison&#39;s trial. And in almost every instance those governors obeyed their orders. Other essential witnesses simply &quot;committed suicide.&quot;
Garrison himself was pilloried and held up to ridicule by the
national news media. Still he persisted.
In the end, with no witnesses [0 testify, Garrison&#39;s trial ended in not guilty verdicts. Still. after 50 years he remains the only person ever to bring anyone to trial for the murders that occurred in Dallas some fifty years ago.
In this book, based on the evidence and testimony associated with the murders of Kennedy and Oswald, I have tried to present events as they actually occurred and show who was truly behind them. And I do so with no apologies to anyone.
I will say that my heart goes out to Marina Oswald and her two daughters June Lee and Rachel. May God be with them." />
