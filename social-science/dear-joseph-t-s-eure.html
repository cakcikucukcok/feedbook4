yourself and others. At a very young age Joseph is separated from his family
and endures hatred and cruelty in an orphanage in the 1930s. His only
connection to them is through a collection of letters he receives throughout
his life, in which he learns of their adversities and struggles to survive. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=MsoNormal style=&#39;text-align:justify&#39;&gt;Later he receives a personal

life.&lt;/p&gt;
