  <title>Age of Anger - Pankaj Mishra</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;A &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; Notable Book of 2017 o Named a Best Book of the Year by &lt;i&gt;Slate &lt;/i&gt;and NPR&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt; o Longlisted for the Orwell Prize&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;One of our most important public intellectuals reveals the hidden history of our current global crisis&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;How can we explain the origins of the great wave of paranoid hatreds that seem inescapable in our close-knit world--from American shooters and ISIS to Donald Trump, from a rise in vengeful nationalism across the world to racism and misogyny on social media? In &lt;i&gt;Age of Anger&lt;/i&gt;, Pankaj Mishra answers our bewilderment by casting his gaze back to the eighteenth century before leading us to the present.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He shows that as the world became modern, those who were unable to enjoy its promises--of freedom, stability, and prosperity--were increasingly susceptible to demagogues. The many who came late to this new world--or were left, or pushed, behind--reacted in horrifyingly similar ways: with intense hatred of invented enemies, attempts to re-create an imaginary golden age, and self-empowerment through spectacular violence. It was from among the ranks of the disaffected that the militants of the nineteenth century arose--angry young men who became cultural nationalists in Germany, messianic revolutionaries in Russia, bellicose chauvinists in Italy, and anarchist terrorists internationally.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today, just as then, the wide embrace of mass politics and technology and the pursuit of wealth and individualism have cast many more billions adrift in a demoralized world, uprooted from tradition but still far from modernity--with the same terrible results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Making startling connections and comparisons, &lt;i&gt;Age of Anger &lt;/i&gt;is a book of immense urgency and profound argument. It is a history of our present predicament unlike any other.&lt;/p&gt;" />
