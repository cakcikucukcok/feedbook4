  <title>The World Is Flat 3.0 - Thomas L. Friedman</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;This Independence Day edition of &lt;i&gt;The World is Flat 3.0&lt;/i&gt; includes an an &lt;b&gt;exclusive preview&lt;/b&gt; of &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;That Used to Be Us: &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;i&gt;How America Fell Behind in the World It Invented and How We Can Come Back&lt;/i&gt;, by Thomas L. Friedman and Michael Mandelbaum, on sale September 5th, 2011.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;A New Edition of the Phenomenal #1 Bestseller&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;One mark of a great book is that it makes you see things in a new way, and Mr. Friedman certainly succeeds in that goal,&quot; the Nobel laureate Joseph E. Stiglitz wrote in &lt;i&gt;The New York Times &lt;/i&gt;reviewing &lt;i&gt;The World Is Flat &lt;/i&gt;in 2005. In this new edition, Thomas L. Friedman includes fresh stories and insights to help us understand the flattening of the world. Weaving new information into his overall thesis, and answering the questions he has been most frequently asked by parents across the country, this third edition also includes two new chapters--on how to be a political activist and social entrepreneur in a flat world; and on the more troubling question of how to manage our reputations and privacy in a world where we are all becoming publishers and public figures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;The World Is Flat 3.0&lt;/i&gt; is an essential update on globalization, its opportunities for individual empowerment, its achievements at lifting millions out of poverty, and its drawbacks--environmental, social, and political, powerfully illuminated by the Pulitzer Prize--winning author of &lt;i&gt;The Lexus and the Olive Tree.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />
