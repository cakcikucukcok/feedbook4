  <title>Frank Talk - Peter Bollen</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;Barney Frank stands out as an unapologetic liberal: outspoken, accessible, acerbic and substantially intelligent.  A Democrat who is unafraid to stand up to bullies and hypocrites. His one-liners are legendary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During his years in Congress, Barney Frank (D-MA) has built a reputation as a respected leader on many fronts: as an expert debater, a master parliamentarian, and a point man for his party on legislation. The first openly gay congressman, Frank is unafraid to take on difficult issues such as gay rights or the legalization of marijuana for medical purposes. He pulls no punches in his cutting remarks about the many personalities and colleagues he cites and is a favorite guest on the talk show circuit.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Edited and compiled by Peter Bollen, &lt;I&gt;Frank Talk&lt;/I&gt; is an informal collection of quotations from this witty and brilliant congressman who is constantly quoted by news reporters, columnists, and pundits. After a quarter century as an elected official, Frank&#39;s humor and acerbic remarks have been collected in this volume, which includes congressional testimony, selections from his humorous fund-raising letters, and off the cuff comments as reported in the media.&lt;/P&gt;" />
