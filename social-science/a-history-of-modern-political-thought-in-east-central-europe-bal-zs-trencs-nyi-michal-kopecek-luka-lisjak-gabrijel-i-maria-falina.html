  <title>A History of Modern Political Thought in East Central Europe - Balázs Trencsényi, Michal Kopecek, Luka Lisjak Gabrijelčič, Maria Falina...</title>
      <meta name="description" content="A History of Modern Political Thought in East Central Europe is a synthetic work, authored by an international team of researchers, covering twenty national cultures and 250 years. It goes beyond the conventional nation-centered narratives and presents a novel vision especially sensitive to the cross-cultural entanglement of political ideas and discourses. Its principal aim is to make these cultures available for the global &#39;market of ideas&#39; and revisit some
of the basic assumptions about the history of modern political thought, and modernity as such.
The present volume is the final part of the project, following  Volume I: Negotiating Modernity in the &#39;Long Nineteenth Century&#39;, and  Volume II, Part I: Negotiating Modernity in the &#39;Short Twentieth Century&#39; (1918-1968)  (OUP, 2018). Its starting point is the defeat of the vision of &#39;socialism with a human face&#39; in 1968 and the political discourses produced by the various &#39;consolidation&#39; or &#39;normalization&#39; regimes. It continues with mapping the exile communities&#39; and domestic
dissidents&#39; critical engagement with the local democratic and anti-democratic traditions as well as with global trends. Rather than achieving the coveted &#39;end of history&#39;, however, the liberal democratic order created in East Central Europe after 1989 became increasingly contested from left and right alike. Thus,
instead of a comfortable conclusion pointing to the European integration of most of these countries, the book closes with a reflection on the fragility of democracy in this part of the world and beyond." />
