  <title>SONGS AND VERSES OF THE SUFFRAGETTES - music and hymns from the Suffrage Movement - Charlotte Perkins Gilman</title>
      <meta name="description" content="A MUST READ FOR EVERY TEENAGE GIRL AND WOMEN OF ALL AGES! This book will impart the passion and feeling behind the women of the Suffrage movement whithout whom women of today would not have the right to vote and other civil liberties.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Herein are 25 songs and poems compiled from various sources by Charlotte Perkins Gilman (July 3, 1860 &amp;ndash; August 17, 1935), who was active in Californian Suffrage Movement. These are the songs that the Suffragettes sang and the poems which inspired them to take action. She was so well thought of that she was elected to represent California at the National American Woman Suffrage Association convention in Washington, D.C. in 1896, and later the International Socialist and Labor Congress in London.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Gilman&amp;#39;s first book was Art Gems for the Home and Fireside (1888); however, it was her first volume of poetry, In This Our World (1893), a collection of satirical poems, that first brought her recognition. During the next two decades she gained much of her fame with lectures on women&amp;#39;s issues, ethics, labor, human rights, and social reform. She often referred to these themes in her fiction. Gilman&amp;#39;s most famous piece is her short story &amp;quot;The Yellow Wallpaper&amp;quot;, which became a best-seller of the Feminist Press. She wrote it on June 6 and 7, 1890.&lt;br /&gt;
During her life, Gilman published 3 volumes of poetry, 9 novels and novellas as well as 186 short stories in magazines and newspapers.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

It is hard to believe in modern times that the issue of women&amp;#39;s suffrage once wracked the nations of the western world. Riots, demonstrations, and indignant editorials highlight the history of this long battle. The Pitcairn Islands put the world to shame by enfranchising women in 1838, New Zealand and the Cook Islands in 1893, Australia in 1902 and Finland in 1906. The USA finally enfranchised women in 1920 with the 19th Amendment. In the UK it finally succeeded through the passing of two laws in 1918 and 1928. A list of the countries and the years they granted women&amp;rsquo;s suffrage at a national level can be found on Wikipedia.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
25% of the profit from the sale of this book will be donated to charities supporting young women.&lt;br /&gt;
