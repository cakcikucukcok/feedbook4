While the troubled and pejorative history of racial amalgamation throughout U.S. history is a familiar story,&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;The United States of the United Races&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;reconsiders an understudied optimist tradition, one which has praised mixture as a means to create a new people, bring equality to all, and fulfill an American destiny.
