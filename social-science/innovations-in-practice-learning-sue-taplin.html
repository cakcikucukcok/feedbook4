  <title>Innovations in Practice Learning - Sue Taplin</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;As a social work practice educator and trainer, it is useful to seek advice from more experienced colleagues who could help you find ways to overcome difficulties you may encounter in supporting individual students. This book is a handy companion for those times when a colleague is not readily available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The editor, Sue Taplin, chose these contributors for their practice wisdom and because she knew that, from their own experience, they had developed innovative practice that you can adapt to find your own solutions to the problems that you face. The contributors can be said to be experts by experience in their chosen field, some are practitioners, some are academics, but all have faced difficulties in the real world of practice learning and have been generous enough to offer to contribute a chapter to this edited textbook.&lt;/p&gt;" />
