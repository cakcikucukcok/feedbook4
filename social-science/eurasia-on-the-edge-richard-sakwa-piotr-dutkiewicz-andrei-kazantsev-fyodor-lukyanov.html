  <title>Eurasia on the Edge - Richard Sakwa, Piotr Dutkiewicz, Andrei Kazantsev, Fyodor Lukyanov...</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Eurasia, wherever one draws the boundaries, is very much at the centre of discussions about today&amp;rsquo;s world. Security across Eurasia is a global concern and has been subject to a range of discussions and debate. However, the current tensions over security and world order, with the growing challenges from Eurasia and Asia, require more intense scrutiny. The goals of the book are to explore the challenges facing the region and to assess how to achieve economic, social and political stability in the Eurasian core. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The book&amp;rsquo;s chapters are written by prominent experts in the field, and together contribute to the continuing debate by providing policy advice for managing crises in the region. Conflicts inevitably arise in the Eurasian space as global powers, regional powers and individual states jockey for positions and influence. These conflicts need not reach a crisis state provided the foundations of conflict, and the surrounding frameworks, can be better understood. To do this, it is necessary to examine the issue of security in Eurasia from a multi-dimensional perspective that challenges any and all assumptions about Eurasia and global order. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;This volume has two overarching goals. The first is to come to a better understanding of key security threats in the Eurasian region from a multi-dimensional &amp;ndash; social, political, economic and institutional - perspective. The second is to discuss policies directed to increase mutual security in and around the Eurasian core. Although the crisis of security affects the whole continent, the area covered by the former Soviet Union and its neighborhood is at the epicenter of the current crisis. On the one side, the Atlantic community is consolidating and extending. On the other, various &amp;lsquo;greater Asia&amp;rsquo; ideas are in the making. All of Eurasia is in danger of becoming an extended shatter zone, a vast new, shaky &amp;lsquo;borderland&amp;rsquo; trapped between two great systems of power and world order.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />
