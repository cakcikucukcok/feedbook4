  <title>The Resistance Handbook - Markos Moulitsas, Huttner Michael</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The Resistance Handbook: 45 Ways to Fight Trump&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s time to fight back.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
In November 2016, Donald Trump lost the national popular vote&amp;mdash;by a lot!&amp;mdash;yet managed to stumble into the White House. Trump&amp;rsquo;s presidency is not just an indictment of our political system&amp;mdash;it&amp;rsquo;s an affront to our core values as a nation. How could such an ignorant autocratic buffoon claim to represent such a diverse, open, and free society?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
A majority of Americans have been shocked, dismayed, and disgusted&amp;mdash;for good reason&amp;mdash;by Trump&amp;rsquo;s actions since he took office. But we aren&amp;rsquo;t taking it lying down. Across the United States, the Resistance is growing, as many thousands of patriotic Americans lead the charge against the corrupt and traitorous Trump regime&amp;mdash;and the Republican Party that is enabling him.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This book is for all Americans who consider themselves part of the Resistance&amp;mdash;people like us who wake up every day and think, &amp;ldquo;What more can I do to stop Trump?&amp;rdquo; The book offers 45 ways to stop the 45th president of the United States in his tracks, including ways to:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;&amp;bull;Protect our culture&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;from the degrading effects of Trump&amp;rsquo;s presidency, which rewarded bullying, sexism, racism, and xenophobia.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;&amp;bull;Protect our communities&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;from Trump&amp;rsquo;s personal attacks, which he and his Republican friends target at women, people of color, youth, immigrants, Jewish people, Muslims, and others.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;&amp;bull;Fight for our values and the issues that define us&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;mdash;in the face of a four-year assault on racial justice, income equality, the environment, women&amp;rsquo;s rights, education, and worker&amp;rsquo;s rights.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;&amp;bull;Build the infrastructure this movement needs&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;(and sorely lacks), including the capacity to register and get out the vote for the 97 million Americans who didn&amp;rsquo;t cast a ballot in 2016; to find, train and promote tomorrow&amp;rsquo;s leaders; and to develop the media organizations that will report the facts and promote our values and candidates.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Markos Moulitsas, founder of Daily Kos, and Michael Huttner, founder of ProgressNow, have built two of the nation&amp;rsquo;s largest advocacy organizations. Now, in The Resistance Handbook: 45 Ways to Fight Trump, they offer a much-needed guide to fighting Trump and building a better, more just, and more equitable America.&lt;/p&gt;" />
