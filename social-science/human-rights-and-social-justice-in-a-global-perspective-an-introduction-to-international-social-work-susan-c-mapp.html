  <title>Human Rights and Social Justice in a Global Perspective: An Introduction to International Social Work - Susan C. Mapp</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Recognizing the growing importance of awareness of international social issues for social workers, this thoroughly revised edition provides an updated introduction to a variety of these issues in the Global South, including AIDS, forced labor and war and conflict. A new issue in this edition is examining how the changing physical environment impacts social work practice around the world. The Universal Declaration of Human Rights, as well as other UN human rights documents, is used as a framework to examine examples of social injustice and human rights violations. The issues are examined in their cultural contexts to help the reader understand how they developed and why they persist. Each chapter for a particular issue ends in a Culture Box which offers an in-depth look at the issue in a particular country, enabling the reader to gain a deeper understanding of how culture impacts the development of social issues. Suggestions for effecting change, both in ones personal or professional life are listed for each chapter and an Appendix offers a variety of resources for engaging in international social work." />
