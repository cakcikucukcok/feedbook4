  <title>The Betrayal of Work: How Low-wage Jobs Fail 30 Million Americans And Their Families - Beth Shulman</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;Following its publication in hardcover, the critically acclaimed &lt;I&gt;Betrayal of Work&lt;/I&gt; became one of the most influential policy books about economic life in America; it was discussed in the pages of &lt;I&gt;Newsweek&lt;/I&gt;, &lt;I&gt;Business Week&lt;/I&gt;, &lt;I&gt;Fortune&lt;/I&gt;, the &lt;I&gt;Washington Post&lt;/I&gt;, &lt;I&gt;Newsday&lt;/I&gt;, and &lt;I&gt;USA Today&lt;/I&gt;, as well as in public policy journals and in broadcast interviews, including a one-on-one with Bill Moyers on PBS&amp;#8217;s &lt;I&gt;NOW&lt;/I&gt;. The &lt;I&gt;American Prospect&lt;/I&gt;&amp;#8217;s James K. Galbraith&amp;#8217;s praise was typical: &amp;#147;Shulman&amp;#8217;s slim and graceful book is a model combination of compelling portraiture, common sense, and understated conviction.&amp;#8221;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Beth Shulman&amp;#8217;s powerfully argued book offers a full program to address the injustice faced by the 30 million Americans who work full time but do not make a living wage. As the influential Harvard Business School newsletter put it, Shulman &amp;#147;specifically outlines how structural changes in the economy may be achieved, thus expanding opportunities for all Americans.&amp;#8221; This edition includes a new afterword that intervenes in the post-election debate by arguing that low-wage work is an urgent moral issue of our time.&lt;/div&gt;" />
