  <title>Remnants of a Shattered Past - Sharon Brunner</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Remnants of a Shattered Past&lt;/i&gt; presents a revolutionary view of the causes behind the challenges many Native Americans face today as a result of historical trauma. The story of the Native American people is told in two ways in this creative non-fiction literary work.  Brunners retelling of the Native American history by her protagonists, Eagle and Coyote, reads as a well-written oral transcript.  They travel through time to bring to life what it was like for the Native American people throughout history.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the non-fiction portion of the book the author presents an understanding of the traditional period for the Ojibwe people, the ramifications of power and control through patriarchal domination and the Church, the realization of Manifest Destiny, the outcomes of historical trauma, and proactive ways in which Native Americans and others can make positive changes to enhance their overall well-being. &lt;/p&gt;" />
