  <title>“Now I Can Call Myself a  Biker” - David Royle</title>
      <meta name="description" content="David has always had a passion for classic cars, right from an early age, but had always wanted to ride a motorcycle. He left this until the age of 47,when his brother in law passed his test and bought himself a Triumph Thunderbird. That did it. As soon as David sat on Nigel&#39;s bike, he decided he would pass his test and buy his own Triumph. This is exactly what he did, but there was one small problem. 
David picked up his new bike on his 50th birthday, but had missed out on all that valuable experience he should have picked up in his younger years. He&#39;d left it too late. So David decided he needed to get some miles under his belt an took a Harley across America and has never looked back.
This is the story of of David&#39;s exploits and adventures to gain that experience he so desperately  wanted and it has shown that even at his age, in his mid-life crisis, it wasn&#39;t too late to learn how to ride a motorbike.
This book will appeal to the many motorcycle enthusiasts out there, as well as the more mature person thinking about taking up biking." />
