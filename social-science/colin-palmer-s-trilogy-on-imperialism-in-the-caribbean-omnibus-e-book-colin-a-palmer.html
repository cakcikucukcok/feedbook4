  <title>Colin Palmer’s Trilogy on Imperialism in the Caribbean, Omnibus E-Book - Colin A. Palmer</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This Omnibus E-Book brings together all three of Colin A. Palmer&#39;s books on the making of the modern Caribbean.  Included are:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Freedom&#39;s Children: The 1938 Labor Rebellion and the Birth of Modern Jamaica&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is the first comprehensive history of Jamaica&#39;s watershed 1938 labor rebellion and its aftermath. The rebellion produced two rival leaders who dominated the political life of the colony through the achievement of independence in 1962. Alexander Bustamante, a moneylender, founded the Bustamante Industrial Trade Union and its progeny, the Jamaica Labour Party. Norman Manley, an eminent barrister, led the struggle for self-government and with others established the People&#39;s National Party.  Palmer sheds new light on the nature of Bustamante&#39;s collaboration with the imperial regime, the rise of the trade-union movement, the struggle for constitutional change, and the emergence of party politics in a modernizing Jamaica.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cheddi Jagan and the Politics of Power:  British Guiana&#39;s Struggle for Independence&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Palmer here tells the story of British Guiana&#39;s struggle for independence. The work details the rise and fall of Cheddi Jagan--from his initial electoral victory in the spring of 1953 to the aftermath of the British-orchestrated coup d&#39;etat that led to the suspension of the constitution and the removal of Jagan&#39;s independence-minded administration. Bringing the larger story of Caribbean colonialism into view, this work shows how violence, police corruption, political chicanery, racial politics, and poor leadership delayed Guyana&#39;s independence until 1966, scarring the body politic in the process.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Eric Williams and the Making of the Modern Caribbean&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this first scholarly assessment of Williams (1911-1981), founder of the Republic of Trinidad and Tobago&#39;s first modern political party and the nation&#39;s first prime minister, Palmer explores his life as a scholar and politician and his tremendous influence on the historiography and politics of the Caribbean. Palmer focuses especially on a 14-year period of independence struggles in the Anglophone Caribbean, when Williams helped resolve regional disputes and promoted the creation of a pan-Caribbean federation.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;" />
