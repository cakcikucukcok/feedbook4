      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;The #1 New York Times bestseller&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The phenomenal true story of the black female mathematicians at NASA whose calculations helped fuel some of America&amp;#8217;s greatest achievements in space. Soon to be a major motion picture starring &lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Taraji P. Henson, Octavia Spencer, Janelle Monae, Kirsten Dunst, and Kevin Costner. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before John Glenn orbited the earth, or Neil Armstrong walked on the moon, a group of dedicated female mathematicians known as &amp;#8220;human computers&amp;#8221; used pencils, slide rules and adding machines to calculate the numbers that would launch rockets, and astronauts, into space. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among these problem-solvers were a group of exceptionally talented African American women, some of the brightest minds of their generation. Originally relegated to teaching math in the South&amp;#8217;s segregated public schools, they were called into service during the labor shortages of World War II, when America&amp;#8217;s aeronautics industry was in dire need of anyone who had the right stuff. Suddenly, these overlooked math whizzes had a shot at jobs worthy of their skills, and they answered Uncle Sam&amp;#8217;s call, moving to Hampton, Virginia and the fascinating, high-energy world of the Langley Memorial Aeronautical Laboratory. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even as Virginia&amp;#8217;s Jim Crow laws required them to be segregated from their white counterparts, the women of Langley&amp;#8217;s all-black &amp;#8220;West Computing&amp;#8221; group helped America achieve one of the things it desired most: a decisive victory over the Soviet Union in the Cold War, and complete domination of the heavens. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Starting in World War II and moving through to the Cold War, the Civil Rights Movement and the Space Race, &lt;em&gt;Hidden Figures&lt;/em&gt; follows the interwoven accounts of Dorothy Vaughan, Mary Jackson, Katherine Johnson and Christine Darden, four African American women who participated in some of NASA&amp;#8217;s greatest successes. It chronicles their careers over nearly three decades they faced challenges, forged alliances and used their intellect to change their own lives, and their country&amp;#8217;s future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#160;&lt;/p&gt;" />
