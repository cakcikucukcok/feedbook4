  <title>Generation B - Suru Manek</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Are You Tired of Being Victimized by Racism?
Generation B gives real solutions to bring success to Black America
Black America suffers.
Poverty. Babies with no fathers. Illiteracy. Crime rates through the roof.
There are many cry &quot;racism&quot; as the problem, but how many offer solutions that work? A homeless black man said it best, &quot;success is the best revenge.&quot; But how can a whole segment of America&#39;s population find success when it is so beaten down?
Generation B: Black America&#39;s Reset to Success offers a revolutionary solution to the problems Black America faces. Author Suru Manek learned to stand up to racism and discrimination in colonial Africa and found fantastic success in America. But he never liked the ever-widening chasm of racial inequality America exhibits. He wondered--what would happen if African Americans applied a cultural blueprint similar to his own? Generation B: Black America&#39;s Reset to Success is the result.
Discover the magic mix of cultural elements that can bring success to even the most oppressed. 
Racism exists in America, but you do not need to become a victim to it. Generation B offers a solution for Black America, one which African Americans everywhere are invited to participate. For real change will only happen when black communities across America decide to reset themselves as a culture and change from within." />
