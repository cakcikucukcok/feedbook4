  <title>Driven - Richard Foot</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Shortlisted, East Coast Literary Award and Evelyn Richardson Prize for Non-Fiction&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was over in seconds. In the early hours of January 12, 2008, seven members of a high school basketball team and their coach&amp;#39;s wife died instantly when their school van collided with a tractor trailer. Travelling in dirty weather, minutes from their Bathurst, New Brunswick, homes, the impact forever shattered the lives of eight families and their community. In the weeks that followed the horrific crash, two women who lost their sons in the accident forged a bond. Ana Acevedo and Isabelle Hains were transformed by their unimaginable grief into unlikely agents of courage and change. It was Isabelle and Ana who pushed the provincial government into holding an inquest into the accident. It was Isabelle and Ana who pushed the province into following the recommendations of that inquest. And it was Isabelle and Ana who made it safer for children to travel to extracurricular activities, in New Brunswick and across the country. A gripping story told in heartbreaking detail, Driven reveals the truth behind one of this country&amp;#39;s worst school tragedies, and the two women who fought for justice in the name of their sons.&lt;/p&gt;" />
