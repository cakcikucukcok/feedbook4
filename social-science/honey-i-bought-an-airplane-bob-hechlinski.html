  <title>Honey, I Bought an Airplane - Bob Hechlinski</title>
      <meta name="description" content="No one else ever took a trip like this.
Nearly 600 trips, actually. But who cares, I thought, when first approached to edit the manuscript for this book  about flying into every little airport in Indiana, then moving on to those in surrounding states? Pilots? Perhaps. Even so  
Im a writer, not a pilot. And Bob Hechlinski is a pilot  not a writer. Except  Bob has an insatiable curiosity about people, places, events, you name it. To him, an airport is more than a name or a spot on a map. Hes a great listener. He has ears and eyes for detail  nuggets that many people either overlook or dont connect with other nuggets like dots on a page, to create picture after picture after picture. 
And Bob has a gift for gab. Storytelling, if you will. So if you believe (as I do) that writing is talking when you cant be there, give this book a listen. 
Hear things you never knew about John Dillinger, Al Capone, a WWII pilot named OHare  back-road encounters on Mackinac Island and not flying under the bridge  out-maneuvering storm clouds  the Oshkosh air show  close-knit neighborhoods with hangar-garages  airports in Ohio  police in Gary, Indiana  the link between Northwestern University and a historic Lake Michigan passenger-ferry tragedy  how a teenagers Happy Birthday flight launched a career  and more. Much more. 
Some people read books from page 1; the opening line hooks them. Others check the ending first. (If I like how it ends, Ill like getting there.) With Honey, feel free to start in the middle; pick a page  any page. Chances are, you will quickly be drawn in and pulled onward from one mini-tale to the next. And at some point, youll say Geez, lets go back and read the rest! I did. 
Cmon along for the ride. Bob makes even the shortest hop a fun trip.
