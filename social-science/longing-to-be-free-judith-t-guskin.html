  <title>LONGING TO BE FREE - Judith T. Guskin</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;This novel is set in tumultuous times 1630-1677 in colonial New England and London. In the beginning there was peaceful co-existence between the English colonists and the Native American Nations. Comfort Bradford, the daughter of the Governor of Plymouth, is friends with her Wampanoag neighbors; she speaks their language and respects their culture. Decades later her friend Metacom leads his people and other tribes in a united effort against the colonies. It was a war that almost destroyed all New England towns and native villages. Why did this war happen? Was it a just war?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Inspired by true events, this richly-detailed novel brings to life the leaders - Native Americans, colonists and members of the London Parliament - whose beliefs and actions shaped history for generations. Comfort&amp;#39;s dreams, fears, passions and daring actions are woven throughout this historical novel of friendship, love, religious conflicts, politics and war.&lt;/p&gt;" />
