  <title>A Time of Our Choosing - Todd S. Purdum</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The authoritative account of America&#39;s most controversial war since Vietnam, a conflict in which &quot;shock and awe&quot; were not confined to the battlefield&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It was a war like no other the United States had ever fought. It began with the bombing of Saddam Hussein&#39;s bunker and ended with statues of the Iraqi dictator being toppled in downtown Baghdad, and it marked a turning point in America&#39;s relations with its enemies, its allies, and its sense of itself. Yet most Americans experienced the war as impressionistic and often confusing--the story of one battle here, one unit there, a report from one city, then another, without the larger context we so urgently needed. Each reporter had his &quot;slice&quot; of the war, it seemed, but no one had the whole story or the broad view.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;A Time of Our Choosing&lt;/i&gt; fills that gap brilliantly, drawing on the unparalleled resources and reportage of &lt;i&gt;The New York Times&lt;/i&gt;. Todd S. Purdum, one of the paper&#39;s most gifted storytellers, traces the war in Iraq from the first rumblings after 9/11, to the diplomatic recriminations at the United Nations, to the battles themselves and their aftermath. He deftly rolls out the whole canvas before our eyes, showing how the individual &quot;slices&quot; fit together into a single, gripping drama.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Purdum also explores the complex legacy of America&#39;s near-unilateral action. Since the 9/11 attacks, President George W. Bush has vowed that the United States would confront its enemies &quot;at a time of our choosing,&quot; and Purdum shows in vivid terms what this choice has meant for our now transformed world.&lt;/p&gt;" />
