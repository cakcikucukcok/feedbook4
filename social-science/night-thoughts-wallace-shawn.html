Those ideas and opinions are about the state of the world: physically, politically, and with regard to the idea of morality. There is little to truly argue against as far as his observations are concerned.<br /><b><i>Night Thoughts by Wallace Shawn - Goodreads</i></b> | Wallace Shawn shares his Night Thoughts in this charming 75 page essay which covers all the situations I too seem to have considered though my life experiences could not be more different from his. My favorite image is described on page 11 when he is standing in a square in what then was East Berlin reading Brecht's poem carved in stone.<br /><b><i>Night Thoughts: Shawn, Wallace: 9781608468126: Amazon.com ...</i></b> | "Shawn has a way of pulling the reader into conversation, making the experience of Night Thoughts feel like more than moving through an extended essay by an important American playwright and actor. Somewhere, as one reads it, the feeling of friendship appears, as if Shawn has known you for years, and now, late in his life, he's decided to tell you what it's all about."<br /><p><h3 align="left">Download Ebook|PDF|Epub of <a href=>Night Thoughts - Wallace Shawn</a> </h3></p><hr/>
