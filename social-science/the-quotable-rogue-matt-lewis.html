And it&#39;s not because she&#39;s controversial -- it&#39;s because she&#39;s usually just right.&lt;/P&gt; &lt;P&gt;?S.E. Cupp, political columnist and culture critic, author of &lt;I&gt;Losing Our Religion: The Liberal Media’s Attack on Christianity&lt;/I&gt;&lt;/P&gt; &lt;P&gt;As you&#39;ll see in Matt&#39;s book, the reason for Sarah Palin&#39;s popularity is that she speaks in a blunt fashion and exposes truths that the politically correct job-protecting elites are fearful of. &amp;nbsp;She is a far wiser woman than Katie Couric.&lt;/P&gt; &lt;P&gt;?Andrew Breitbart, Breitbart.com, author of &lt;I&gt;Righteous Indignation&lt;/I&gt;&lt;B&gt;&lt;B&gt;&lt;B&gt;&lt;B&gt;&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/B&gt; &lt;/P&gt; &lt;P&gt;&lt;/P&gt; &lt;P&gt;Sarah Palin drives the left crazy and makes many of the Republicans who collaborated with Democrats to destroy our fiscal wellbeing duck and cover. &amp;nbsp;Matt Lewis captures, through Sarah Palin&#39;s own words, her wit, wisdom, and basic sense that America remains the last best hope for mankind.&lt;/P&gt; &lt;P&gt;&lt;/P&gt; &lt;P&gt;?Erick Erickson, Editor-in-Chief of RedState.com&lt;/P&gt; &lt;P&gt;Steadfast in her beliefs and fearless in her demeanor, Sarah Palin has become a leading voice in today’s conservative movement and has inspired a new generation of activists.
