  <title>The China-Pakistan Axis - Andrew Small</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The Beijing-Islamabad axis plays a central role in Asia&#39;s geopolitics, from India&#39;s rise to the prospects for a post-American Afghanistan, from the threat of nuclear terrorism to the continent&#39;s new map of mines, ports and pipelines. China is Pakistan&#39;s great economic hope and its most trusted military partner; Pakistan is the battleground for China&#39;s encounters with Islamic militancy and the heart of its efforts to counter-balance the emerging US-India partnership. For decades, each country has been the other&#39;s only &#39;all-weather&#39; friend. Yet the relationship is still little understood. The wildest claims about it are widely believed, while many of its most dramatic developments are hid- den from the public eye. This book sets out the recent history of Sino-Pakistani ties and their ramifications for the West, for India, for Afghanistan, and for Asia as a whole. It tells the stories behind some of its most sensitive aspects, including Beijing&#39;s support for Pakistan&#39;s nuclear program, China&#39;s dealings with the Taliban, and the Chinese military&#39;s planning for crises in Pakistan. It describes a relationship increasingly shaped by Pakistan&#39;s internal strife, and the dilemmas China faces between the need for regional stability and the imperative for strategic competition with India and the USA." />
