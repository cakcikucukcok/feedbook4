  <title>Vietnam War - Vinh Truong</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The author discusses the three Axioms in the dominant interpretation of the U.S.-Vietnam War that were established by the invisible permanent government right after the National Security Council meeting on September 21, 1960. They are: 
- There was never a legitimate non-communist government in Saigon (dissolution GVN) 
- The U.S. had no legitimate reason to be involved in Vietnamese affairs (Tonkin-Gulf-Incident) 
- The U.S. could not have won the war under any circumstances (U.S. troops honorable withdrawal) 
There are many reasons why the author decided to write this book, The New Legion. He felt compelled to write it for the longest time; after spending thirteen years in the Communists so-called reeducation camp. He escaped from a canal in the Mekong Delta and drifted in a rickety old boat similar to a childs toy from South Vietnam for fourteen days until he reached the nearest Pacific island, Palawan Islands, Philippines. He knew the pain that all the people who were involved suffered yet he thought that perhaps it might be best to let it become a not-so-distant memory. Now, he has finally decided to write the truth at last. It is the story of loyalty, duty, honor, and love." />
