  <title>Canadian Warbird &amp; War Prize Survivors - Harold A. Skaarup</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The purpose of this handbook is to provide aviation enthusiasts with a handbook on where to find the surviving retired military aircraft preserved in Canada. The majority of the &lt;I&gt;Canadian Warbird and War Prize Survivors&lt;/I&gt; are on display within a significant number of aviation museums. Many others are displayed as &quot;gate guards&quot; on or near a number of Canadian and Allied Armed Forces Bases and installations. There are also a few in the hands of private owners and collectors that have been restored to flying status. These include a number of foreign warbird survivors that were brought back to Canada as War Prizes. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;The museum staffs and volunteer organizations such as the Canadian Aviation Preservation Association (CAPA) have done tremendous work in preserving military and civilian aircraft that have been a major part of Canada&#39;s aviation heritage. A few of these aircraft are illustrated in this book, along with a short description of the aircraft flown by Canadian servicemen and women. The aircraft are listed alphabetically, along with a city or museum location, the manufacturer, aircraft serial number and call sign where known. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Canadian Warbird and War Prize Survivors&lt;/i&gt; is part of a series on aircraft used by the Canadian Forces throughout its history. &lt;/P&gt;" />
