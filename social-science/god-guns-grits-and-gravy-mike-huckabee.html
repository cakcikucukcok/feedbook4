  <title>God, Guns, Grits, and Gravy - Mike Huckabee</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;USA Today&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Wall Street Journal&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;Publishers Weekly&lt;/i&gt; bestseller from a presidential candidate for the 2016 election!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;In &lt;i&gt;God, Guns, Grits and Gravy&lt;/i&gt;, Mike Huckabee asks, &quot;Have I been taken to a different planet than the one on which I grew up?&quot;  The &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt;  bestselling author explores today&#39;s fractious American culture, where  divisions of class, race, politics, religion, gender, age, and other  fault lines make polite conversation dicey, if not downright dangerous.  As Huckabee notes, the differences of opinion between the &quot;Bubble-villes&quot; of the big power centers and the &quot;Bubba-villes&quot; where most people live are profound, provocative, and sometimes pretty funny.  Where else but in Washington, D.C. could two presidential golf outings cost the American taxpayers $2.9 million in travel expenses? Government bailouts, politician pig-outs, and popular culture provocations from Jay-Z and Beyoncé to Honey Boo-Boo to the Duck Dynasty&#39;s Robertson family. Gun rights, gay marriage, the decline of patriotism, and the mainstream media&#39;s contempt for those who cherish a faith-based life.  The trouble with Democrats, the even bigger trouble with Republicans, our national security complex, and how our Constitution is eroding under our noses. Reflections on our way of life as it once was, as it is, and as it might become...these subjects and many more are covered with Mike Huckabee&#39;s  signature wit, insight, and honesty.&lt;/p&gt;" />
