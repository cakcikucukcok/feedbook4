  <title>Leyland Comet - Graham Edge</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This book is about one of Leyland Motors&#39; famous models, the Leyland Comet. It covers the period from the introduction of the lorry in 1947 to its withdrawal from the British market in the mid-1970s. This illustrious name continued to be used in the Leyland-DAF era, such is the high regard and respect earned by one of Leyland&#39;s finest vehicles not only here, but also overseas. Leyland Comet presents the initial development of the model and the various types which evolved in subsequent years. When it was first introduced, the Leyland Comet was an immediate success and soon became the market leader in the high-quality, medium weight, lorry sector. In the 30 years of production history described in these pages, the Comet was only seriously challenged by its great rival, the AEC Mercury. In its heyday, the Leyland Motors name was synonymous with top quality. Their Comet range maintained and enhanced the company&#39;s reputation. Many small haulage firms building a business in the post-war years aspired to a Leyland lorry and felt a great sense of achievement when able to acquire one. This book has been out of print for many years, and has been brought back in 2016 to make this fascinating story available again to Leyland enthusiasts and those with an interest in general transport history. Graham Edge is a trucking journalist and author." />
