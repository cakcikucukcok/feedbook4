      <meta name="description" content="The fifth installment in the continuing series of Warrior Poet Wisdom.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Gone are the days of swords and shields, knights and paladins. But warriors still walk among us. Their strength and grace is as effective in dealing with today&amp;#39;s challenges as it was in olden times. Their intensity and resolve can be applied to every task in our day to day lives, from work to working out. Their patience and focus are essential to living a stress-free life. Their courage and fortitude allow us to seek success and happiness, not simply wait for it as so many others do. Their selflessness and love reveals to us the greatest purpose in life: service to others. Their balance and peace ensures that nothing will ever shake any of our other virtues. All of these elements combine to form the greatest inspirational tool of all: wisdom.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Peace + strength + grace + intensity + resolve + patience + fortitude + selflessness + focus + balance + courage + love = wisdom" />
