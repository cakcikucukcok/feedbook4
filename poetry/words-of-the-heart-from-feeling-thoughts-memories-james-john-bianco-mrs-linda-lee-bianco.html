  <title>Words of the Heart from Feeling, Thoughts &amp; Memories - James John Bianco, Mrs. Linda Lee Bianco</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;On December 27, 1990, I was given half a page in New Jersey The Star Ledger devoted to my work of poetry and short stories written for children, which included opinions about my writing from those who had seen, heard and read my work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In March of 1990 I received the Award Of Merit Award for one of my Poems titled, In Searching by The World Of Poetry, and on June 12, 1990, I was awarded The Golden Poet Award, and a title I held for five years or more, also presented by The World Of Poetry. ON January 31st, 1991 I was contacted by The New Jersey Arts Council asking me to be part of its Art Task Force on February 12, 1991, at which time we would sit down and focus on ways that The Arts Council could be supportive to the needs of other individual artists such as me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the year of 1991 my work titled Because Of You and In Searching was presented in The World Of Poetry Anthology and in 1998 I was asked by The National Library Of Poetry to allow my work to be published in their 1998 Book of Anthology titled, An Eternal Flame and again in 1998 with t heir book titled The Glistening Stars for my work titled, Moments Spent With You. Also in 1998 once again I was asked to allow my work to be published in their third book of Anthology titled Surrounded By Dreams which included another of my works titled, Searching and in 1998 The National Library Of Poetry presented me with their Editors Choice Award for outstanding achievement in writing.&lt;/p&gt;" />
