  <title>Beneath the River - Lisy Kuriakose</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Poet Lisy has taken topics, matters, concept and ideas from life and nature, common to each one but woven a magic around them with words, verse, rhymes and feelings. If anything pleases our mind due to its perfect blend in design, colour combination, lighting, structure and that perfection is poetry.
Lisy has succeeded in providing to all age group as a sculptor silently carving his fully developed sculpture mentioned in the title poem  Beneath the River. The present Hi Tech. swipe generation and internet whiz kids hardly know what poets and poetry do to our society and their contribution towards humanities. In fact words are magic which can heal, generate life and console all distressed minds. The contribution of Lisy is highly appreciable, as she exalted the status of Indian community in Kuwait, by writing this book in the dominant language of the world, hence accessible to all people and proved that language is not a barrier. 
The 51 poems in this book touch many instances in our daily life, or we see diversified lives, unnoticed by common people. The merit of a poet lies when he/she picks up subjects from life. The first poem The Inheritor is a best example of black comedy. Other poems Turtles Life, A Chef , Unseen sobbings will really melt the hearts of the readers. A Twilight, Four winds, First Flower of the Spring and Mother Nature show a poets passion in mingling with nature. She also expresses her concern over shortness of life and the struggles of soul after death. Going through the poems, we can see the transformation of the poet as Philosopher, Mother, Preacher, Spiritual Leader, Benevolent person and Guide. 
This book is really an asset with its content and matters." />
