  <title>The Mystical Rose - Adélia Prado</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;?Adélia Prado was &quot;discovered&quot; when she was nearly 40 by Brazil&#39;s foremost modern poet, Carlos Drummond de Andrade, who was astonished to read her &#39;phenomenal&#39; poems, launching her literary career with his announcement that St Francis was dictating verses to a housewife in the provincial backwater of Minas Gerais. Psychiatrists in droves made the pilgrimage to Divin&amp;amp;#243;polis to delve into the psyche of this devout Catholic who wrote startlingly pungent poems of and from the body; they were politely served coffee and sent back to the city. After publishing her first collection, Baggage, in 1976, she went on to become one of Brazil&#39;s best-loved poets, awarded the Griffin Lifetime Achievement Award in 2014. Adélia Prado&#39;s poetry combines passion and intelligence, wit and instinct. Her poems are about human concerns, especially those of women, about living in one&#39;s body and out of it, about the physical but also the spiritual and the imaginative life; about living in two worlds simultaneously: the spiritual and the material. She also writes about ordinary matters, insisting that the human experience is both mystical and carnal. For her these are not contradictory: &#39;It&#39;s the soul that&#39;s erotic,&#39; she writes. &#39;Sometimes other poets and critics analyse my writing, and they&#39;ve said how, even though the text is made of colloquial and everyday language, the work goes to transcendental issues. I don&#39;t know, I don&#39;t explain things; I simply do what I do. I only know how to write about concrete, immediate and commonplace things. But these commonplace things show me their metaphysical nature. I can only see the metaphysical, the divine, through the concrete and the human.&#39; &#39;Brazil has produced what might seem impossible: a really sexy, mystical, Catholic poet&#39; – Robert Hass.&lt;/div&gt;" />
