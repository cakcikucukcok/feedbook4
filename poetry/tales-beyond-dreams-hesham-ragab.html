  <title>Tales Beyond Dreams - Hesham Ragab</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;This is a collection of seven epics, lyrics of seven respective musical albums, which I also composed. During that period of my life I passed through various experiences, which profoundly influenced my life and eventually my compositions, whether musical or lyrical. Maybe they could be a true reflection!
&lt;P&gt;A teenager of the seventies, I was a fan of classical and rock music with a special interest in progressive and heavy rock, which quite influenced my musical style and stirring ideas driving my potential writing gear. The various readings of science fiction, eastern ethnical beliefs and philosophies, some significant motion pictures, and the surrounding world of changes; incarnating tyranny, deceit, war, inhumanity, injustice...all contributed and had tangible impact on forming my ideology.
&lt;P&gt;&lt;I&gt;The Martyr&lt;/I&gt;, the old-young man, who loved his human brotherhood and nature, whose enigma was to salvage them, who desparately searched for love but was absurdly treated, and winded up a martyr of his own principles! Could a simple person make a drastic decision to stop the wrong? Free the abused, whatever it took him? &lt;I&gt;The Raver&lt;/I&gt; was sort of decisive evolution to countervail the dark world presented in the &lt;i&gt;Demons&#39; Kingdom&lt;/I&gt;.
&lt;P&gt;&lt;I&gt;Land of a Thousand Dreams&lt;/I&gt;, blindness! What a mysterious world? Is it better or worse? A bless or a curse? An evolution, a paradigm shift from delirium to step on the threshold towards the route to promise land. Travelling in space and time, traversing life and death to reach reality, a contemplation of the mind was &lt;I&gt;The Journey&lt;/I&gt;!
&lt;P&gt;When you have acquired knowledge, then you should share it and help others, lead them to enlightenment! &lt;I&gt;Fly Free Gentle Dove&lt;/I&gt; is the aim. Have I really grasped the knowledge and gone beyond it to reach unity with the universe? The recapitulation is in the &lt;i&gt;Voyages on the Oceans of Mystery&lt;/I&gt;.
