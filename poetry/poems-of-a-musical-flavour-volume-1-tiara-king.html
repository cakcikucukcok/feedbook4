  <title>Poems Of A Musical Flavour: Volume 1 - Tiara King</title>
      <meta name="description" content="In 1989 I was 15 and started writing song lyrics. Why? Because I wanted to be the Australian version of Debbie Gibson, on whom I was also majorly crushing. I thought I was hot and wrote prolifically, although I started writing late in the year. I was also playing drums in my music class&amp;rsquo;s end-of-year musical.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
In 1990 I was 16 and out of school, listening to more, doing more, and reading more. So more artists were in my life and I was starting to analyse song lyrics, which I guess led me to analyse books&amp;hellip;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Little did I know over the seven and a bit years I wrote that it was setting me up for bigger and better scribblings, namely novels over 500 pages and 100,000 words, and now novellas and short stories.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This book features lyrics I wrote from 1989 to 1990 and contains some witty one liners and anecdotes about what was happening, who I wanted to be, or who I had a crush on.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
They are not perfect, nor meant to be, they&amp;rsquo;re just the musings of a young teenage girl with crushes and dreams.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Enjoy!" />
