  <title>The Game of the Dragon: An Extension to the Tao Te Ching - Simon C.H. Lai</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The Tao Te Ching, or Book of the Way, is an ancient Chinese text focused on the art of living and is broadly considered one of the wonders of the world. The Tao looks at the basic dilemma of being alive and gives advice that imparts both stability and perception. Now, modern poet Simon C. H. Lai builds on the foundation of this groundbreaking work through poetic verse. The Game of the Dragon is a selection of new poems written as an extension to the Tao. This collection looks at the Tao in a different light, perhaps a darker light. In this collection, poet Lai explores the Tao and its symbols and encourages readers to consider its use in daily life. He utilizes the Tao to soothe emotions and hone peaceful patterns of behavior. The author&#39;s inner peace and study of Lao Tzu&#39;s masterwork will inspire readers to seek and do the same, fostering a more fulfilled life and kinder interactions with others." />
