  <title>Traveling Moons - Mary Pauer</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;When Mary Pauer was seven, she became a cowgirl who sported a fringed skirt, matching vest, and a hat with a potato chip curl. Sixty years later, she lives on a small hobby ranch with a barn and horses. Although she has ridden in Africa, South America, Canada, Australia, and in the Rockies, Pauer is always soothed by the expanse of her fields and the rush of the wind through the grasses and trees. On the farm, she is more more herself than anywhere else. In a thoughtful collection of prose and poetry, Pauer candidly reflects on life in a rural setting as she crosses seasons, wanders the edges of fields, peers into nests and dens, admires the open skies, and explores the sharing and trust that permeates the community. Her writings passionately celebrate life on the farm while offering observations on nature accompanied by deep insights, witty commentary, and a lyrical appreciation of Earths bounty. Traveling Moons shares a delightfully honest view into one womans relationship with the natural world as she reflects on life on the farm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mary Pauer takes you by the hand and leads you into a literary world layered with heartache, sensuality, and the beauty found in the singular moment.&lt;/p&gt;
