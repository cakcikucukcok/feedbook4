  <title>Words from the Highways and Byways - Gary L. Hudgeons</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The following words are but a few simple things that I learned. Do not get me wrong I was there in Height Ashberry, SanFransisco Ca. on Preach Tree Street Atlanta Ga. and in Greenish village. New York I had a hell of time at Filmorewest, Seen some pretty amazing things in my life. But I have also lost many friends including my brother. And most were lost to drugs, alcohol and flat stupidity and there is nothing I can do to change it now. But now I hope some of the kids that are coming up now will realize that drugs are something that they should be afraid of. And that they should know, that no matter how good they make you feel. There is a cost, a cost in lives lost, in the years you may spend behind bars. I do not know why I was so lucky to still be alive, or not locked up for the rest of my life, or in a state mental hospital. I attribute it to pure dumb LUCK! Please read and learn from my mistakes and learn to live. Find hope in your life, find a love to hold on to and never ever give up. Go through life and do the best you can and dont hurt anyone, and do not worry about the rest,,, its all bullshit." />
