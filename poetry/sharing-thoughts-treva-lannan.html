      <meta name="description" content="I&#39;m a Grandma Moses of poetry as I started writing at age 80 in 2006, a year after my husband died.  I believe writing keeps life interesting and  one of the reasons for living.  This is my second book of poetry.   My first one Can you hear me? was published in 2012.
My life in a nutshell
So many of my friends
are no longer living.
Seven of my children live
in six different states,
the other five live here in town
all busy, still have time for Mom.
No longer the big family dinners
I miss but don&#39;t mind,
I have Finley my cat
in sight or my lap.
TV mostly garbage
our library the best
my life full of memories
each day a gift,
I can choose how to spend it,
a large part in writing
my friend, my love, my life.
