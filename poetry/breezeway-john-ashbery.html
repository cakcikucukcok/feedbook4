  <title>Breezeway - John Ashbery</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;A bold, striking new collection of poems from one of America&amp;#8217;s most influential and inventive poets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With more than twenty poetry collections to his name, John Ashbery is one of our most agile, philosophically complex, and visionary poets. In Breezeway, Ashbery&amp;#8217;s powers of observation are at their most astute; his insight at its most penetrating. Demonstrating his extraordinary command of language and his ability to move fluidly and elegantly between wide-ranging thoughts and ideas&amp;#8212;from the irreverent and slyly humorous to the tender, the sad, and the heartbreaking&amp;#8212;Ashbery shows that he is a virtuoso fluent in diverse styles and tones of language, from the chatty and whimsical to the lyrical and urbane. Filled with allusions to literature and art, as well as to the absurdities and delights of the everyday world around us, Ashbery&amp;#8217;s poems are haunting, surprising, hilarious, and knowing all at once, the work of a master craftsman with a keen understanding of the age in which he lives and writes, an age whose fears and fragmentation he conjures and critiques with humor, pathos, and a provocative wit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vital and imaginative, Ashbery&amp;#8217;s poems not only touch on the &amp;#8220;big questions&amp;#8221; and crises of life in the twenty-first century, but also delicately capture the small moments between and among people. Imaginative, linguistically dazzling, and artistically ambitious, &lt;em&gt;Breezeway&lt;/em&gt; is John Ashbery&amp;#8217;s sharpest and most arresting collection yet.&lt;/p&gt;" />
