  <title>Circling Round Everything:2015-2016 - Arlene Corwin</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Lifes not a cloud of hodgepodge, but a sparkle of connections and reconnections disparate in appearance.  Theres not a noun that fits.  Not one cloud&#39;, sparkle, not one verb, adjective or noun that covers it because this thread of being is always changing its appearance. 
     So we write.  Differing poems, differing themes.  But all one chain of links  of different sizes and shapes: variations on a theme. 
     One long metaphor for being-ness connected by causes subtle and apparent, immediate and easy to trace  or long back and untraceable.
     With not one single word to take it all in, to describe it, name it, it is an appearance, a going-on.  A perpetual ongoing.
     Also something to see through, to be comforted by when it looks like a cause for suffering, something to enjoy when it does not.
     It is lists of inadequate words and findings, of gradualness leading to suddenness, of the invisible to visible.
Its everything.  So we write about everything." />
