  <title>The Many Facets of Love - Shaolyn Rhee Jean</title>
      <meta name="description" content="When I started to write this book, I didnt know it was going to be a sad
inspirational kind of book. I started to write what I was feeling at that
moment and later on, what other people around me might be thinking and
feeling after a betrayal when I put myself in their shoes. This book is about
feeling betrayed, deceived, and abandonned by someone that said they
loved you. It is also about the joy of feeling alive when you have the love
and respect of that other person. In addition, it is about feeling rejected
by that same person who prophesized his or her love to you in the fi rst
place. When I was done writing, I realized that it was to be a sad book
about love ending and how many facets love could have and at the same
time, inspirational for others so they wont make the same mistake listed
in the book.
I hope you enjoy reading it as I enjoyed writing it for you.
Best Wishes" />
