  <title>No Cross No Crown - Angel Eyes</title>
      <meta name="description" content="No Cross, No Crown is a collection of
poems with spiritual connotations, mixed with a little lively humor and
true-to-life lessons. When faced with an adverse report from a doctor
or some other tragedy in life; Where did God go? and No Cross, No
Crown would offer a great source of comfort. On the lighter side of
things, when there are social functions or family gatherings, if theres
room for a joke or two, The Raid, Swim on By, All Ma Cloth,
and a few others would put a smile on the grumpiest face. These poems
were written mostly by inspiration, some by demand, and others were
adapted from stories told about life on the family islands, for example,
Sam Majors Wife, The Wake, and Belle, Island Gal.
I hope that this book would bring you joy, laughter and inspiration to
help you through trying times as well as remind you of some memorable
event(s) in your life.
So, sit under a coconut palm, relax, and grab a nice chilled glass of
lemonade as you browse through this book. Enjoy! Enjoy! Enjoy!" />
