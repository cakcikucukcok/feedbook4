      <meta name="description" content="Closing Letter From Leroy
You have now completed volume five which means you all have traveled with me through the entire series. I wish to thank you all for traveling with me through my written moments. If you are inspired to write about your own life don&#39;t wait for someone to tell you when to start. This is your life and you must get moving because time is not waiting for any of us. As I leave you with my series: TIMELIGHTENMENT and SOULSPLITTING you must know that your life matter even if you don&#39;t see it. You are here for some reason; you must live to walk towards your living purpose. People can point you, but you must walk into your dreams. You can even run if you like! It is your time to spiritually shine so please get out and share your dream light.
Mom, I don&#39;t know if you are watching over your family. I don&#39;t even know what&#39;s on the other side of this life, I promised you I will not give up on those things I told you I would do. I will not give up because I feel you are watching the moves I am making. These books are for you, GOD, your family, and the entire world. 
KNOW THAT YOUR LOVE FROM THE OTHER WORLD SUSTAINS ME! WITH LOVE
YOUR SON!!
I want to thank the readers&#39; for your support.
If I am blessed to write another series, I will gladly bring it to life for you.
Respectfully,
Leroy" />
