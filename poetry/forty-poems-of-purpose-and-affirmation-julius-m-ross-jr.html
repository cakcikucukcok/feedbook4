  <title>Forty Poems of Purpose and Affirmation - Julius M. Ross Jr.</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Affirming Your Relationship With God is an inspired first book of poetry by Julius M. Ross, Jr. It is a work that captivated the hearts of others before he ever thought of publishing it. As he states: Comments in response to reading my journal entry for Day 20: Restoring Relationships inspired me to begin typing this manuscript. As I read to a friend, she cried and said to me, That was beautiful. When I heard this, my faith in what God was doing through my journal entries of verse was increased and confirmed. Then, I knew these words had the power to make a difference, and have an affecting presence in the lives of others." />
