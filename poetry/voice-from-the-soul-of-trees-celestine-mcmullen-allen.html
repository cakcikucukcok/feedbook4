Voice from the Soul of Trees
Even before you read the first poem in this collection, I would like to set the stage for what the book is about.  The book provides a contrast of  nature and life, their parallel collage; their montage; and a voice that blends life together.  Life, as we all experience it, does not have a singular dimension.  Neither does this collection of poetry.  But what is does provide is a focus on our collective entities; you, I, us, and mankind; embracing, and living life as one; beyond boundaries.   First, we are one with self; and secondarily, we are one with the world in which we live together; especially our loved ones.
The resonant analogy is with nature, man, and living.  The dominate figure in this collection is the tree; nature; and how nature and life work together.  Trees have always intrigued me. They represent how life can comingle, and how they can create their own palette just as sisters and brothers, uncles and aunts, nieces and nephews, cousins, extended family members, friends, co-workers, acquaintances; people that challenge you; people that protect you, and people that love you; a universal tree.  
 My initial inspiration came from this strong pecan tree that was in the backyard of my homestead.  The tree was strong, stout, and sturdy; hovering limbs, knotty branches, and deep roots.  This tree represented life on so many levels.  It was more than a tree that provided spending money in her season of bounty or a tree that represented the toil of having to rack her abundant leaves.  This tree   represented wisdom; life; living; being grounded; strength of mankind, shelter, and unity.  
So with this frame of reference, I look to all trees to provide the same lessons.  I can ride along the countryside, and see a tree, and become inspired by its beauty.  I can feel the life that emits from her roots; her branches; her strength and her spirit.  I see trees comingling together; oftentimes a unique family relies on the natural order of life to dictate their unique place.    
Reminiscent of life, our distinctive styles of living, and our sometimes disjointed realities, I look to the soul of the tree.  It is from this perspective that I have penned this collection of poetry and prose.  The uniqueness of the tree; in varying seasons, bless us with their flowers or their fruit.   In varying seasons, the fruit is bountiful.  In varying seasons, they lie dormant; bearing the harshness of cold winters.  In varying seasons, we only see the stumps of their existence.  In the spring of their season, they give us new trees strong enough to bear strong branches, knotty limbs, and deep roots.
