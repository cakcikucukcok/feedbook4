  <title>Heartbreaks and Revelations - M. T. Haris, Shabila Arben</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This is for you who stayed. This is for you who smiled even if your world was falling apartfor you who tore down walls. This is for you who loved too much. This is for you who had faith and believed that maybe people could change  even when they didnt. This is for you who suffered the pain of heartbreak and yet survived. Your heart broke, but you still lived.
Heartbreaks and Revelations is a collection of poems for the broken hearted. Overflowing expresses the feeling of so much love for someone elsetoo much love, perhapswhile you forgot to love yourself. Cold expresses the chill of a closed-off heart. In the Crowd bemoans the emptiness of a crowded city when your beloved is no longer around.
True, there is pain in this poetry and prose. Yet, author M. T. Haris does not wish to simply wallow in the agony of lost love. No, she believes that it doesnt matter how many times you fall. It does not matter how many times you get hurt. What matters is that you never give up hope and realize that through every heartbreak there is meaning and inspiration." />
