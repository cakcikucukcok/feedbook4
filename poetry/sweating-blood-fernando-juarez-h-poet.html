  <title>Sweating Blood - Fernando Juarez H. Poet</title>
      <meta name="description" content="In Sweating Blood we experience the highs and lows driving the pen onward. As H-Poet unravels his art, his passion illuminates the harsh realities of life: societys apathy towards performance poetry, the restricting demands imposed on us by others at work, the threats daily life poses, and more. The poet shifts moods and shares his thoughts on how to have a momentary escape from it all by indulging in one of two types of beverages. One gives your day a jump-start and the other relaxes and distances you from reality whenever the need to get away arises. He suggests daily poetic expression as a necessary venting avenue to keep mind and body focused and content. The poems reveal the poets commitment and love for his family, his loyalty to his friends, and his willingness to communicate via e-mail, Facebook, or anyway of your choice to listen to your deepest or most burdensome thoughts. Through it all the poet candidly promotes remaining true to yourself and being proud of who you are, where you came from, and what you have become. He encourages you to fulfill your dreams and live life without regrets for doing what feels right to you. Only by doing so can life be customized to bring you the ultimate fulfillment you seek." />
