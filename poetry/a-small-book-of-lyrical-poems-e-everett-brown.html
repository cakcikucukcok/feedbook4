  <title>A Small Book of Lyrical  Poems - E. Everett Brown</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Come Home
I have been to many faraway places
I have seen many different faces
Now, I see a whole lot of good
In this, the old neighborhood
Where is this old neighborhood?
A place from which society expects no good
Where everyone is expected to fail
But despite it all they thrive and prevail
Its such a joy, makes you feel real good
To live here in the old neighborhood
For you hear boisterous and jovial laughter
Mixed with loud down-home banter
The playground is asphalt or concrete
And the parks have not one decent seat
But children play, and life is still good
Day after day right here in the hood
As a child of the hoods mean street
Growing up was tough, no easy feat
And no matter how far you may roam
Remember the hood is forever home
There are still no willows or shady trees
The summer is funky hot, no cool breeze
The guys and gals still dress in them fine clothes
Guys with earrings, gals with rings on their toes
Sorry that life troubles are keeping you down
And that happy smile is turning to a frown
God bless, dont hesitate, no need to phone
Th e hood will always welcome you; come home
