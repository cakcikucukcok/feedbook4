  <title>Homer’s Traditional Art - John Miles Foley</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;In recent decades, the evidence for an oral epic tradition in ancient Greece has grown enormously along with our ever-increasing awareness of worldwide oral traditions. John Foley here examines the artistic implications that oral tradition holds for the understanding of the &lt;em&gt;Iliad&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Odyssey&lt;/em&gt; in order to establish a context for their original performance and modern-day reception.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In &lt;em&gt;Homer&#39;s Traditional Art&lt;/em&gt;, Foley addresses three crucially interlocking areas that lead us to a fuller appreciation of the Homeric poems. He first explores the reality of Homer as their actual author, examining historical and comparative evidence to propose that &amp;quot;Homer&amp;quot; is a legendary and anthropomorphic figure rather than a real-life author. He next presents the poetic tradition as a specialized and highly resonant language bristling with idiomatic implication. Finally, he looks at Homer&#39;s overall artistic achievement, showing that it is best evaluated via a poetics aimed specifically at works that emerge from oral tradition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Along the way, Foley offers new perspectives on such topics as characterization and personal interaction in the epics, the nature of Penelope&#39;s heroism, the implications of feasting and lament, and the problematic ending of the &lt;em&gt;Odyssey&lt;/em&gt;. His comparative references to the South Slavic oral epic open up new vistas on Homer&#39;s language, narrative patterning, and identity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Homer&#39;s Traditional Art &lt;/em&gt;represents a disentangling of the interwoven strands of orality, textuality, and verbal art. It shows how we can learn to appreciate how Homer&#39;s art succeeds not in spite of the oral tradition in which it was composed but rather through its unique agency.&lt;/p&gt;" />
