      <meta name="description" content="Thou hast made me endless, such is thy pleasure. This frail vessel thou emptiest again and again, and fillest it ever with fresh life.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This little flute of a reed thou hast carried over hills and dales, and hast breathed through it melodies eternally new.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;At the immortal touch of thy hands my little heart loses its limits in joy and gives birth to utterance ineffable.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Thy infinite gifts come to me only on these very small hands of mine. Ages pass, and still thou pourest, and still there is room to fill.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When thou commandest me to sing it seems that my heart would break with pride; and I look to thy face, and tears come to my eyes.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;All that is harsh and dissonant in my life melts into one sweet harmony&amp;ndash;and my adoration spreads wings like a glad bird on its flight across the sea.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I know thou takest pleasure in my singing. I know that only as a singer I come before thy presence." />
