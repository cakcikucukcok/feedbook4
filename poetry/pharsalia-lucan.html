  <title>Pharsalia - Lucan</title>
      <meta name="description" content="De Bello Civili; On the Civil War, more commonly referred to as the Pharsalia, is a Roman epic poem by the poet Lucan, detailing the civil war between Julius Caesar and the forces of the Roman Senate led by Pompey the Great. The poem&amp;#39;s title is a reference to the Battle of Pharsalus, which occurred in 48 BC, near Pharsalus, Thessaly, in northern Greece. Caesar decisively defeated Pompey in this battle, which occupies all of the epic&amp;#39;s seventh book. In the early twentieth century, translator J. D. Duff, while arguing that &amp;quot;no reasonable judgment can rank Lucan among the world&amp;#39;s great epic poets&amp;quot;, notes that the work is notable for Lucan&amp;#39;s decision to eschew divine intervention and downplay supernatural occurrences in the events of the story. Scholarly estimation of Lucan&amp;#39;s poem and poetry has since changed, as explained by commentator Philip Hardie in 2013: &amp;quot;In recent decades, it has undergone a thorough critical re-evaluation, to re-emerge as a major expression of Neronian politics and aesthetics, a poem whose studied artifice enacts a complex relationship between poetic fantasy and historical reality.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The poem was begun around 61 AD and several books were in circulation before the Emperor Nero and Lucan had a bitter falling out. Lucan continued to work on the epic &amp;ndash; despite Nero&amp;#39;s prohibition against any publication of Lucan&amp;#39;s poetry &amp;ndash; and it was left unfinished when Lucan was compelled to suicide as part of the Pisonian conspiracy in 65 AD. A total of ten books were written and all survive; the tenth book breaks off abruptly with Caesar in Egypt.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Lucan is heavily influenced by Latin poetic tradition, most notably Ovid&amp;#39;s Metamorphoses and of course Virgil&amp;#39;s Aeneid, the work to which the Pharsalia is most naturally compared. Lucan frequently appropriates ideas from Virgil&amp;#39;s epic and &amp;quot;inverts&amp;quot; them to undermine their original, heroic purpose. Sextus&amp;#39; visit to the Thracian witch Erichtho provides an example; the scene and language clearly reference Aeneas&amp;#39; descent into the underworld (also in Book VI), but while Virgil&amp;#39;s description highlights optimism toward the future glories of Rome under Augustan rule, Lucan uses the scene to present a bitter and gory pessimism concerning the loss of liberty under the coming empire." />
