  <title>Poetry from the Heart - DenHagan</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This book contains over twenty-eight different types of poetry, with explanations and examples of each type. Many of my poems are romantic, such as My Beloved, Ode to Melissa, To Love a Woman, My Hearts Desire, Love, and My Love. While others are inspirational, like Forgiveness, Hope, The Seven Virtues, Empathy, and Kindness. Still others are philosophical in nature, such as my poems Living, True Freedom, Who Knows What Tomorrow Brings, and The State of the Economy. My kyrielle poem Life could be said to be both inspirational and philosophical. Some of my poems are educational, like The Benefits of Reading, which extols the virtues of reading, and To Be Young Again, which talks about nutrition and exercise.
Some are family-oriented poems, such as my poem Little Bit, which I wrote for my niece Kristin, or Camping with Younger Brother, which I wrote for my brother Craig, or Little Child, which I wrote for all the little ones in the world. Other poems are devoted to naturelike my Froggy, Turtle, Tornado, and Mother Nature poemsor to mankind in general, such as Earth on Which We Live and True Happiness. And others were written with some fun in mind, like the poem Nude I wrote in response to an online contest to rhyme the last word in each line with the word nude. (Birthday Lesson is another fun poem like this.) I also did a series of seven poems on each of the seven deadly sins, where I used archaic language to spoof each of these sins, which unfortunately often plague mankind. I truly hope you will enjoy reading the poems contained in this book." />
