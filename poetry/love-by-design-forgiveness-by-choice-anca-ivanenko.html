  <title>Love by Design, Forgiveness by Choice - Anca Ivanenko</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Why do we suffer, when we love? Does the other person cause us pain, or is it the disconnect between reality and the ideal we try to match it against? Could suffering be optional? Author Anca Ivanenko believes that every emotion and every thought is the result of a choice.  She shares her poetic musings on the turmoil of love, acceptance, forgiveness and empowerment, in &lt;i&gt;Love by Design, Forgiveness by Choice&lt;/i&gt;.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
In this moving poetry collection, Ivanenkos words flow in rhyme as emotions fill each poem. Readers will fall in love as &lt;i&gt;Two Worlds&lt;/i&gt; collide. They will discover why love is &lt;i&gt;A Blessing and a Curse&lt;/i&gt; and experience regret when The One comes &lt;i&gt;Too Late&lt;/i&gt;. They will learn &lt;i&gt;To Love&lt;/i&gt;, to &lt;i&gt;Stop&lt;/i&gt; suffering, to forgive &lt;i&gt;A Good Heart&lt;/i&gt; and honor its &lt;i&gt;Sweetest Memory&lt;/i&gt;. A touching piece, &lt;i&gt;Until We Meet Again&lt;/i&gt;, is dedicated to the authors father who passed away.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Complemented by an arresting collection of abstract images, &lt;i&gt;Love by Design, Forgiveness by Choice&lt;/i&gt; is a memorable anthology that will resonate with everyone who has ever fallen in love or dreams of finding The One." />
