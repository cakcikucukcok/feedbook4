  <title>Scraped Knees - Joanne L. Bond</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The poems in Scraped Knees tell of a journey from memories of childhood in the poem Step Into to thoughts about death in Frozen in Time, Missing, and Just Beyond.  Five poems speak to the feelings and thoughts one has when told that one has cancer.  These poems are Revelation, Reflections, Hope, and CA, and Statistics.  
Oyster Stew and Super Bowl were written to celebrate the time spent with my mother when she was on hospice.  We watched the New England Patriots win their first Super Bowl and even she cheered at the end.  That time will always be a most cherished memory.
Some of the poems in Scraped Knees speak of faith and of learning to quiet the mind during Friends meetings for worship.  Winter Darkness, Tears, and Human Touch look at the darker side of life while other poems, Solitude and Journey celebrate what life can be.
And then theres Journeying Companions and Heres To, poems that speak to the friendship and comfort one may find in the time spent with four legged friends.
My poems attempt to look at and picture in ones eye the many sides and moments in a lifetime of journeying.  They look at the joyful and peace-filled days and walk through the reality of the more difficult happenings that one may face." />
