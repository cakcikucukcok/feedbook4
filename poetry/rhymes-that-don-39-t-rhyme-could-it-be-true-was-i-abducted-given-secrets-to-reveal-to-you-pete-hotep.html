  <title>Rhymes That Don&#39;t Rhyme: Could It Be True? Was I Abducted, Given Secrets to Reveal to You? - Pete Hotep</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Rooted in African spirituality and history as well as black unity, Rhymes That Don&#39;t Rhyme is a collection of poems that once coursed through the poet&#39;s mind. Some of the poems are erotic, while others shine light on the dark conspiracies that imprison the African American community. The words of poet Pete Hotep are also a call to action. The status quo cannot change unless people change first: While in the room on Sirius, the Dog Star that shines so bright it can be seen from afar. I was given this message first: &quot;Tell them to &#39;collect their collective consciousness.&#39; Thing are getting worse. Spiritual vampires are sucking your energy, you see. Check it out if you don&#39;t believe me.&quot; Hotep&#39;s poems are like short stories that expose facts and unmask the lies of American history. Readers will be more than metaphorical dragon slayers; they will be able to enter the dragon&#39;s lair without fear and slay the mainstream agenda. It&#39;s time to stand up and fight as one-before it&#39;s too late" />
