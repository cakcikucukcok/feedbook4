  <title>A New Song - D. P. Myers</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The Psalms frequently issue a call to sing a new song unto the Lord. While this call is often thought to refer to singing the Psalms or even other songs written by those more gifted than ourselves, Myers suggests such is not the primary intention. For as we are all beings created in the image of God, we are all called to create new songs in response to the word and work of God. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
It is with this in mind that Myers encourages the Christ-follower to consider a new approach to time spent in Scripture. The reader is encouraged to meditate on the Psalms and then respond with a unique song of worship to God. By seeking to create a new worshipful response to the Psalms the reader may find that the inevitably dry devotional times that nearly all of us encounter have been invigorated. &lt;/p&gt;
A New Song is both a devotional and a guidebook. As a devotional, the reader is offered a glimpse into Myers multi-year journey through the Psalms resulting in the writing of over 170 poems. Each poem, when read alongside the accompanying Psalm, can help the prayerful reader to consider the ways in which God may be speaking through each Psalm. As a guidebook, A New Song briefly discusses our innate creative nature and then offers suggestions which, when illustrated by Myers examples, will encourage you to find your own creative voice with which to sing a new song unto the Lord." />
