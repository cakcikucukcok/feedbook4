  <title>Life Final Chapter and Other Poems - Gladys McDonald Smith</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;html&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The poems in this book is full of life hope and dreams past, present and future of what life is expected to be.
As we go through life many challenge we find ourselves face with things past, present and future. Life can throw any obstacles in our way, its up to us rather to step over them or just lie down and excepted life as it is. My own experience in life taught me that what ever we face in life theres always an answer for every thing, rather we receive to believe it or not is totally left up to us. As I traveled through life many challenge  I  found myself writing my most precious thought down thinking Ill come back and read them when I want to find comfort or peace within my soul. In the wee hours of the morning when the house is silent and darkness is still around my most interment thought are found dancing in my head waiting to be lead on paper and stored in a place  thinking that no one will read but myself. Life began to challenge me when I remember  back to certain event that drove me to write thinking, Ill store this treasure up under lock and key no one would find it but me ,so I thought.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
As I began to travel the distance of life set before me I found in the early part of my marriage I would write my husband these long letter of my thoughts, because I just wasnt the type who could hold a conversation well. As I wrote little did I know that it would lead to become such an adventure in my life. In this book of poetry you will find how a young women beat the odds of silent and open up to a hold new life of communication.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I would start my day each morning reading an inspirational poem to my friend at work from a book. So one day I decided to give it a try thinking to myself I can do this. On writing my first poem and letting my friends read it ,writing began for me then. They were honest enough to let me know how what they read touched their hearts. As people began to read my work they start asking me to write poems for them on special occasions, and I did without hesitations. As I wrote for other as well as myself little did I know that it would lead to this point in my life. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
In this book youre read how friend, love one and everyday people find ways of comfort just by reading words that touch their hearts and sent healing. Poetry is writing that releases the soul of man to write about whats hidden down inside of ones soul. Yes we all have hidden treasure just sitting pounding upon our minds just waiting to be release to peoples who could take it and heald from darkness that they thought light could no longer shine, I take the most interment thought of one person and transfer it so that there understanding could be seen more clearly. I know youre wondering how do some one do that. I find it easy just by conversation with them. Remember I said that it was not something I was good at doing, but now it a gift that I found.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Writing is the most profound reason people write today. I found it to be rewarding and  comforting where peace is found. Taking words and making them dance across the pages send chill up my spine. I find myself as I write hidden inside this world that no one knows but me. I began to pick ,choose and write words that dance across my page sending messages to the reader, letting them know even though we go through many things in life that will carry us to experience sadness, happiness. Laughter, and tears we can still go on and conquer in this world the one thing we all hope for and thats peace for all man kind.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
In this book of poetry youll find the color of the rainbow just as God intended it to be fill with many colors, youll find how He took each one and mold them as He saw fit. How the raindrops and clouds, trees and grass are all here for man to enjoy, not to destroy. In this book youll be taken to places far beyond the thought of mankind. How everyday mistakes can be recorded and correctly by the thought of man. I" />
