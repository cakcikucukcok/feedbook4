  <title>Mind of a Writer - Robert A. Grant Jr.</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The role of a poet is to grasp the emotions of humanity and leave an impression on the soul that reminds the world what it means to be alive. Through these collection of poems one will be able to empathize with my eras of pain, happiness, success, failure, uncertainty, love and lust, and how through all this I was able to learn that life is about cherishing blessings as they come. Poetry helps remind us that we are not alone as we go through this trial we call life and connect us with writers that understand what it means to be human. 
The focus of Mind of a Writer is to show that although instances may come and go in our lives, as long as words can capture the essence of the life we live, the lessons we learn will forever live on." />
