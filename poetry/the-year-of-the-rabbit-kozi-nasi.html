  <title>The Year of the Rabbit - Kozi Nasi</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;A woman in her prime, fully aware of her sensuality, not afraid to stare life in the eye and embrace it openheartedly, thrown in the arms of lust and love, pleasure and delirium, courage and devotion, sadness and heartbreak and through it all, remaining fragile and vulnerable, delicate and relatable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the woman that tells her stories through the verses and poems in &lt;i&gt;The Year of The Rabbit&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sentiment that one should always follow their heart and surrender themselves to life as it comes to them; the sentiment of pure unconditional love, exactly as it originates and derives naturally from all human instinct and how it evolves and transforms to survive and live on; is the invisible thread that runs through this collection of poems and the spiritual glue that holds them together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kozi Nasi holds on to her subject and brings you along in all the waves of the emotions that she goes through as well, thus giving you a front row seat into the tumultuous rollercoaster that is her love.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wittily, daringly and in a provocative way, Kozi undresses her feelings of all censure barriers, wraps them in a bow of passion and serves them to you on a luxurious plate full of her most intimate experiences and stories, thus seductively, inviting you to relive them alongside her, as your very own.&lt;/p&gt;" />
