  <title>Broken Silence - James R. Dixon</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Broken Silence&lt;/i&gt; presents a collection of very personal poems that get to the heart of who author James R. Dixon is and what he has to say. He believes that sometimes the quiet ones have the most to say, but getting others to hear them can be a problem. Being di?erent can mean that you may ?nd yourself explaining your actions to others. Dixon has written Broken Silence to explain his feelings and emotions on many subjects that are important to him, as well as to change everyones preconceived notions about him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After years of being persecuted by others who dont approve of him, &lt;i&gt;Broken Silence&lt;/i&gt; is also his break-through collection explaining his thoughts and feelings on relationships and other personal issues. Divided into four sections covering love, emotions, resilience, and good, these verse seek to o?er hope and inspiration to others who are struggling to ?nd themselves in the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;center&gt;Misery Loves Company&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Third time is said to be a charm, but turned out that it wasnt&lt;br&gt;
So what do I make of dating you as I felt my time was a waste&lt;br&gt;
Good times were minimal, but then it becomes clear&lt;br&gt;
You were brought here to teach me a lesson&lt;br&gt;
About karma as they say what goes around comes around&lt;br&gt;
Ive been around with you on more than one occasion&lt;/p&gt;" />
