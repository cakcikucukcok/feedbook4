  <title>Footsteps - Bill W. Stoner</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The classroom of life is always in session. Some folks just have a gift of observing, learning, and expressing the many lessons taught that seem to escape most of us. In these writings, the opportunity to capture many of our own previously overlooked blessings and would-be cherished memories will become evident to the reader, as Bills thoughtful insights of his life experience are shared. Faith, hope, and love are undeniably expressed in this collection of life lessons well learned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Danny Jones, President, Superior Livestock Auction&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this collection of poems spanning more than fifty years, poet Bill Stoner gets personal. He invites you to come along on a journey through his lifeto participate in both happy and sad times, to laugh and cry with him. He allows you to see inside his soul, which radiates a deep faith and trust in God no matter what comes his way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bill takes you to the farm, on a cruise ship, and to the basement of his parents home where all thirty-six of his family members share a bountiful meal and celebrate Christmas in the truest sense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His poems provide insight and wisdom to help you navigate through tough times. They encourage you to help others who may follow in your footsteps even though youre not aware of it at the time. And they help you understand how trials can be stepping stones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His love poems to his wife, Joy, will bring a smile to your face and admiration for a love that has endured for more than half a century.&lt;/p&gt;" />
