This is an excellent and entertaining collection.&amp;#8221;&amp;#151;TIMOTHY STEELE&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;In &lt;I&gt;Meeting the Tormentors in Safeway&lt;/I&gt;, Alexandra Oliver zooms in on the inertias, anxieties, comedies, cruelties, and epiphanies of domestic life:&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;They all had names like Jennifer or Lynne&lt;BR&gt;or Katherine; they all had bone-blonde hair,&lt;BR&gt;that wet, flat cut with bangs. They pulled your chair&lt;BR&gt;from underneath you, shoved their small fists in&lt;BR&gt;your face. Too soon, you knew it would begin,&lt;BR&gt;those minkish teeth like shrapnel in the air,&lt;BR&gt;the Bacchic taunts, the Herculean dare,&lt;BR&gt;their soccer cleats against your porcine shin,&lt;BR&gt;that laugh, which sounded like a hundred birds&lt;BR&gt;escaping from a gunshot through the reeds&amp;#151;&lt;BR&gt;and now you have to face it all again:&lt;BR&gt;the joyful freckled faces lost for words&lt;BR&gt;in supermarkets, as those red hands squeeze&lt;BR&gt;your own. &lt;I&gt;It&amp;#8217;s been so long!&lt;/I&gt; They say.
