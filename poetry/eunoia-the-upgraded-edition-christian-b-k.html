  <title>Eunoia: The Upgraded Edition - Christian Bök</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The word &amp;#145;eunoia,&amp;#8217; which literally means &amp;#145;beautiful thinking,&amp;#8217; is the shortest word in English that contains all five vowels. Directly inspired by the Oulipo (l&amp;#8217;Ouvroir de Litt&amp;#233;rature Potentielle), a French writers&amp;#8217; group interested in experimenting with different forms of literary constraint, &lt;I&gt;Eunoia&lt;/I&gt; is a five-chapter book in which each chapter is a univocal lipogram &amp;#150; the first chapter has A as its only vowel, the second chapter E, etc. Each vowel takes on a distinct personality: the I is egotistical and romantic, the O jocular and obscene, the E elegiac and epic (including a retelling of the Iliad!).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stunning in its implications and masterful in its execution, &lt;I&gt;Eunoia&lt;/I&gt; has developed a cult following, garnering extensive praise and winning the Griffin Poetry Prize. The original edition was never released in the U.S., but it has already been a bestseller in Canada and the U.K. (published by Canongate Books), where it was listed as one of the &lt;I&gt;Times&amp;#8217;&lt;/I&gt; top ten books of 2008.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This edition features several new but related poems by Christian B&amp;#246;k and an expanded afterword.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;" />
