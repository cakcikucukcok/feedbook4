      <meta name="description" content="&lt;b&gt;&lt;CENTER&gt;The PASSION &amp; The POETRY&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/CENTER&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My hardy congratulations on the success of your DVD release. That is a MAJOR stepping stone in your career. The DVD is a truly professional presentation and one you can be very proud of.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Doc Jenkins&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Country and Western&lt;br&gt;
Recording Artist&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That was an entertaining, plus a very practical, philosophical, poetry session. You have been an inspiring example for your children and your friends. Thank You for this gift.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Maryaane&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I read some of your poetry on line, beautiful I like how it covers current stuff. After viewing the DVD I wanted to shout more, more, encore, encore. The presentation like a breath of fresh air. Give us more poetry that sings like soft jazz. Thought provoking and soothing at the same time. I would be honored to support your cause, our cause as human beings, women, grandmothers, friends, and members of a minority.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Lillian Andrew&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My Dear Friend: I loved it, I ran it again for a friend of mine who also thought it was very well doneand liked what you had to say. You are just something else woman!!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Jean Marcmildon&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I truly enjoy your language and i encourage you to go for it all the way, expression is a gift that few of us has and when you have it to share ,it is a blessing..&lt;br&gt; 
God bless love&lt;/p&gt;
