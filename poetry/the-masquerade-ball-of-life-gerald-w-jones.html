  <title>The Masquerade Ball of Life - Gerald W. Jones</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The Masquerade Ball is Geralds fourth book of poetry; its a collection of both poems and some expressions dealing with life issues. Like the first three books, this book again explores aspects of life that most people shy away from. Besides being a tool for dialog between mature adults, it dives into that deep subject as to why people play games with one another and the tricks folks use to disguise true feelings or intentions.
Gerald continues to use poetry to get his views across to a broad audience in hopes some will receive a message that will allow them to grow intellectually and spiritually. Over the past few years, he has learned that many individuals have been turned away from poetry by the simple fact that they dont understand it, they cant relate to it, or that it serves no purpose in their lives. Gerald has resolved those types of issues by making his brand of poetry easy to read and comprehend.
