  <title>Anatomy of Love Addiction - Barbara Fonger</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;This book is about my life. I was born on August 1, 1948 in Seattle, Washington, at Puget Sound Hospital. I ask myself why anybody would want to read a book about me, but it&#39;s not necessarily a book about me. I am hoping that this book will help people that have made a lot of mistakes in their lives understand a little bit more about the process of life and how we can make sense out of some of the mistakes that we&#39;ve made or just be more at peace with the life that we&#39;ve lived.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I remember coming to earth. I know that sounds crazy. I thought it was a little crazy, but you know, I do remember. And I cannot deny it! I&#39;ve really never met in person anyone that has remembered coming to earth. Then a few years ago I got a hold of a book written by Wayne Dyer, and he was the only other person I ever heard that had also remembered coming to earth. God has always seemed so real to me I just felt like I knew him. When I came here, I was waiting in a long line, and it came to be my turn. I was so excited because there were a lot of people or a lot of spirits waiting, and it was my turn! It was very special in the spiritual realm to have the privilege to be wrapped in an earthly body to come to earth! Even if the body was crippled or maimed, somehow it was still a huge privilege! I was so excited about coming I said, &quot;Oh, Lord, send me to the worst family you have, and I&#39;ll tell them all about you. I&#39;ll tell them how much you love them. I know as soon as I tell them how much you mean, how wonderful you are, and what a great Lord you are, they will love you just like I do! Oh, please send me. I will not lose my way, I promise!&quot; He said, &quot;Oh, believe me you will lose your way. Everyone does, but I promise you this: you will always find your way home.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, the next thing I knew I was here. I had no idea what was in store for me! I had made contracts with certain people, and now I had to live up to those contracts. I was here on earth all right, and I was in a real cozy family. The journey had begun.&lt;/p&gt;" />
