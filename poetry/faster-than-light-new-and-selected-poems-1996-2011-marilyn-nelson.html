  <title>Faster Than Light: New and Selected Poems, 1996-2011 - Marilyn Nelson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Conjuring numerous voices and characters across oceans and centuries, Faster Than Light explores widely disparate experiences through the lens of traditional poetic forms. This volume contains a selection of Marilyn Nelson&#39;s new and uncollected poems as well as work from each of her lyric histories of eighteenth-, nineteenth-, and twentieth-century African American individuals and communities.&lt;br&gt;Poems include the stories of historical figures like Emmett Till, the fourteen-year-old boy lynched in 1955, and the inhabitants of Seneca Village, an African American community razed in 1857 for the creation of Central Park. &quot;Bivouac in a Storm&quot; tells the story of a group of young soldiers, later known as the Tuskegee Airmen, as they trained near Biloxi, Mississippi, &quot;marching in summer heat / thick as blackstrap molasses, under trees / haunted by whippings.&quot; Later pieces range from the poet&#39;s travels in Africa, Europe, and Polynesia, to poems written in collaboration with Father Jacques de Foiard Brown, a former Benedictine monk and the subject of Nelson&#39;s playful fictional fantasy sequence, &quot;Adventure-Monk!&quot; Both personal and historical, these poems remain grounded in everyday details but reach toward spiritual and moral truths.&lt;/p&gt;" />
