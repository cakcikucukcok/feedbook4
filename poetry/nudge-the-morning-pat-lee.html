  <title>Nudge the Morning - Pat Lee</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&amp;lsquo;Pat Lee&amp;rsquo;s poetry often reflects her respect and reverence for the things of the natural world. She has an artist&amp;#39;s eye for landscape and a Wordsworthian ability to paint it in lyric poetry. Many of her images and word choices have an inevitability about them, a surety that is enviable. Hers is a poetic voice that is true and trustworthy.&amp;rsquo; &amp;ndash; Louise Nicholas&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;lsquo;Pat Lee&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;Nudge the Morning&lt;/em&gt; is a collection of poetry I found to be the work of the natural poet. Throughout there is a lyricism and landscaping from a once more pastoral time, mixed seamlessly with those of today&amp;rsquo;s both urban and urbane one. Chosen word, inspired subject and thought, accompany throughout any mastery of craft or means ? which are also fully there by the way. Her titling, which can be a hugely neglected art in itself these days, alone draws the reader to each poem. Lee is a poet that not only sees her subjects so well, but one that can take that next vital step ? of conveying things to the reader, indeed fully as she did see them herself. Her work is simply a pleasure to read.&amp;rsquo; &amp;ndash; John Miles&lt;/p&gt;" />
