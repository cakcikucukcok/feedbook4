  <title>Words from Within - Jay F. Downs</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;WORDS FROM WITHIN is a collection of poetry -- simple verse and some prose -- written over a period of forty-eight years. It is separated into six different themes -- Words of Love, Joy, Despair, Wisdom, Faith, and Prose -- although some could be interchanged easily and most are strongly Christian-oriented in their subject matter -- to both challenge and inspire.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most gracious comments one could receive about the early poems came from Rosa Zagnoni Marinoni, the Poet Laureate of Arkansas, who wrote, Your poetry has gentleness and strength -- it is most sincere and heart-felt, and a young lady who said, You seem to be able to say what men since Adam have been trying to say in a manner in which changing the poem would destroy it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Different personal moods and thoughts are expressed as they evolved throughout the years, so a wide range of feelings is touched upon here. Hopefully one will touch you.&lt;/p&gt;" />
