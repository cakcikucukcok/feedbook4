  <title>Scenes the Writer Shows - Mb Moshe</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Scenes the Writer Shows {forty-one places a poem can go} is a collection of poems from travels and experiences.  They describe situations and moments in life (mine or someone elses) that were either positive or negative.  A few poems deal with teenage angst and issues of personal experience either in my own or someone elses life.  The Hustler, for example, loosely mirrors my life and experience as a disabled person. It is a montage of my years living in Downtown Minneapolis, riding public transit and adapting to urban life.  Word-play, meter and music used often to create images that will draw the reader into the poem.  For example, in Waxing on Flames, I tried to create the image of a bonfire by a river with young scouts growing up as flames nurture them along:
We were young and at the mercy
of our means and we flung ourselves
Down upon the flames for what
we knew felt right; I bridled from
Those heated pains that boiled
and tested me; and knelt down to
Pray upon the iron grate while
Moonlight splintered trees to shake
Ripe, fierce winds Id learned to hate;
My poems travel to England, to Scotland and Wales.  They go to the Mid-east and to Norway. They go from my home in Minneapolis to New York and Tennessee." />
