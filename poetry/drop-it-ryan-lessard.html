  <title>Drop It! - Ryan Lessard</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&quot;So who is Ryan Lessard? For a long time he was the &#39;produce guy,&#39; as this is the only contact I&#39;d ever had with him, seeing him stock produce at a local supermarket at which we both worked. We never discussed the ripeness of lettuce, or what season was best for growing tomatoes and, whereas, I&#39;m sure neither of us lost much sleep over that fact, what is unfortunate is that it took almost 10 years before I knew that he was much more than just the &#39;produce guy.&#39; 
Ryan is not just a poet, or a writer for that matter; he&#39;s what I call a reactive visionary. He&#39;s not a prophet; he simply sees. And then he writes. His poetry comes from all elements of life, things that he embraces and expresses to the fullest. His words are honest and powerful without being overtly obvious, or strung out with clichs and typicality; his mind is a maze, one you will want to get lost in-and lose yourself in-time and time again. There isn&#39;t enough poetry like this in the world. It&#39;s gut wrenching, but not vomit-inducing like a lot of so-called modern poetry. It&#39;ll trap you, yet it&#39;s irresistibly inviting. His words are many things; forgettable is not one of them.&quot;&lt;br&gt;-Kenneth Wood 
Author of &lt;i&gt;The Silent Winds of October&#39;&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&quot;He paints the canvas of the mind with the color of thought. What is real remains the same and what was once surreal becomes more than that. A catalyst for the movement he, too, is a ready man, prepared for the cascaded journey ahead. Remembering the past, recognizing the now, and understanding the randomness of the future that may be encountered, no sunrise will go unnoticed; the sun will not set until the task at hand is complete. The illumination places him in his own reflection, forcing the confirmation of his existence, and the evaluation of ours. The power lies within him, it&#39;s on the mind.&quot;&lt;br&gt;-Liam Ahearn
