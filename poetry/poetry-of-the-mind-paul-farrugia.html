  <title>Poetry of the Mind - Paul Farrugia</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Paul Farrugia is experienced information technologist educated in Australia and has come across a kaleidoscope of technologies; some now antiques in the authors own life time. A technology career would seem at first far removed from any works poetry or even a literary career.  Yet are not both means of capturing at the very least a message?
Poetry is the time honoured way of capturing vision and the thoughts of mind and heart throughout history. It also has become the authors tool of exploration just as wooden ships were in the past. My unfathomable ocean of discovery is the emotion of heart, love, vision of mind. I search in the mundane drudgery of everyday life, from the highs of loves peaks to desolation of self, in the windswept desert of lioness and everything in between. These are the familiar landscapes we all traverse in life, the very core of who we are inside. In essence this is very meaning of the journey in poetry I have begun." />
