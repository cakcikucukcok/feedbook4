  <title>Me, My World, and I - A.V. Barber</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The best book since &#39;Pick-Up Lines for Pensioners&#39;
Miss Betty Jones
You just have to buy this book!
Miss Galena Sublime
You have no idea what it&#39;s like sitting on a shelf in the poetry section of a bookshop.  Have you ever noticed how literature designated as being intellectual is always hidden like some top shelf publication in a sweet shop?  I get so lonely down there in all that prehistoric dust.  Truth be known, I get picked up less than Betty Jones at number 47 and shes 92!
As you might have gathered, I&#39;m a little different, well some might even say special!  I&#39;m not so much a poetry book, more a biography of everyday living.  Within my pages you will find the musings and poetry of an &#39;ordinary&#39; bloke from down your street.   This is the life and times of Joe average, a testament to life as you know it and a vote for the real world.
You could say I&#39;m a snapshot of real life written by a real person.  If you buy me I promise to sit on your coffee table and pretend to be intellectual, just think how much more sophisticated you will look!" />
