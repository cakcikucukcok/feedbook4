  <title>Tribute to Brunei and Other Poems - John Onu Odihi</title>
      <meta name="description" content="In this new collection of poetry, Tribute to Brunei and Other Poems, the verses represent the synoptic capture of particular environments and incidents, as well as author John Onu Odihis reflection of them. Presented in a rich texture of imageries, the entries on Brunei, which form a major part of the book, portray a beautiful and peaceful country where modernity and tradition blend to form a harmonious socio-cultural environment. Odihis depiction of the serenity of Bruneis pristine environment in an increasingly browning world and the vivacity of cultural life in the Abode of Peace can whet your appetite for a visit to the sultanate.
Through poems such as Programme Me, Heed the Call, and Lets Help Each Other, Odihi gives cogent reasons for the celebration of human diversity and relinquishment of bigotry, prejudice, and such other vices that divide people. By extolling the virtues of hard work, unity, teamwork, sincerity, faithfulness, and commitment, Odihis Tribute to Brunei and Other Poems presents a strong voice in the ethics that are necessary for peace and human advancement.
Bless You Always
Brunei Darussalam
Abode of Peace
You are a jewel
May the Sun of Righteousness
Rise and shine upon you always
Let there always be justice
Let there always be goodness
Within your borders let mercy flow
May your inward beauty radiate
Like diamond in the sun" />
