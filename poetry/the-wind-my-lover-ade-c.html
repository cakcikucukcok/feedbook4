  <title>The Wind My Lover - Ade C.</title>
      <meta name="description" content="pre-note
about the poems and the book by ade c.
concertina is a musical instrument that exudes rhythms of blues waltz; heightens intensifies as the wind is vacuumed in and out of the fanning panels, played by capable hands!
the beloved concertina a poetess a dreamer 
languishes questions contemplates 
the here the there 
realms of her existence..
the coming the going 
longing needing surrendering
yes love-hate passions 
uncontrolled rages sensual gusto 
of her being!
a discourse a romance of thoughts 
an erotic luscious trembling language 
between two minds poeticized 
as if their skins are one glued tied!!!
similes and metaphors 
metaphysically drawn latched
in vivid imagination 
a sexual intercourse 
of minds!!
some hide behind curtains for various reasons: 
religion tradition culture race age or plain hypocrisy
here, the beloved and the lover submerge savour relish 
the sublime relations its holiness 
the sacredness of their love in thoughts   
their souls bodies spirits mimic 
whirling sounds of wind, 
the roarings of thunder 
and the flashing explosions of lightning                                
the poets pen excites every sheets of paper  
he has no razzmatazz who cares what they say         what they think?erotic waves flaunt float moan laugh 
cry      ahhhhhhhh ooooooooooooooooo!!!
my book lingers  carried by the wind
saucy classy dreamy noble erotic poetry 
a lady a woman  a female whose sensualities 
differ not from any other female of the earth 
both pule in bed!!!" />
