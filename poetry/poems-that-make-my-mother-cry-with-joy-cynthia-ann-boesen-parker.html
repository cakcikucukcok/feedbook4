  <title>Poems That Make My Mother Cry with Joy - Cynthia Ann Boesen Parker</title>
      <meta name="description" content="About the author &lt;bR&gt; &lt;bR&gt;
Meet me, Cynthia Ann Boesen Parker.  I was born October 9, 1964. &lt;bR&gt;&lt;bR&gt;
I am from Glen Ellyn, Illinois, and live in Sarasota, Florida.&lt;bR&gt;&lt;bR&gt;
The early years of my life have influenced my entire remainder of my life.  I went through neurosurgery nine times when I was five years old . The next forty years have been spent making up for time lost to compensating for my weaknesses. &lt;bR&gt;&lt;bR&gt;
Earning an Associates degree from College of DuPage was just the beginning for me.
&lt;bR&gt;&lt;bR&gt;
Moving to Sarasota, Florida was the best thing Ive ever done. &lt;bR&gt;&lt;bR&gt;
In 1990, I met the man destined to become my husband.  We married on January 19, 1991. &lt;bR&gt;&lt;bR&gt;
On January 19, 2011, we celebrated our twentieth wedding anniversary.  There have been many changes in our lives: lost loved ones, furthering of education, changes in residence; but life is stable for now. &lt;bR&gt;&lt;bR&gt;
As a fluke, I began writing poetry.  I was told that Im good at it.
&lt;bR&gt;&lt;bR&gt;
I enrolled in an Adult and Community Education Creative writing coursethat one course has changed my  life, forever. &lt;bR&gt;&lt;bR&gt;
One of the lines from one of my first poems expresses exactly how I feel, namely: &lt;bR&gt;&lt;bR&gt;
I want to write, write, write till my words touch the sky
&lt;bR&gt;&lt;bR&gt;
This is me, Cynthia Ann Boesen Parker.  Ive gone through serious illness and life tragedies to get here; to the writing that has given me a wonderful new life. &lt;bR&gt;&lt;bR&gt;
Look out world, here comes Cynthia Ann Boesen Parker. &lt;bR&gt;&lt;bR&gt;" />
