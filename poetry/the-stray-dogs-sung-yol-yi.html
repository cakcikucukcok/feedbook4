  <title>The Stray Dogs - Sung Yol Yi</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The Stray Dogs is a book of poetry written by a man whose memories of war have poignantly affected his whole life. A feeling of sadness pervades many of these poems as they are the compositions of a man whose heart has been deeply broken by his experience during the Korean War and the memories of it that continue to haunt him.
As a young boy, Yi had to tighten his belt to alleviate his hunger pangs. And now, in his award-winning poem The Belt, he declares to the whole world that Then I buckle up my belt, I am ready.
His poems also encompass a variety of other subjects, like the challenges of being an immigrant, the frustrations of the language barrier, his affection for his children, inspiration drawn from nature, the environment, reflections on his travels, and so on.
Mr. Yi discovers himself, and the world itself, through writing his poetry." />
