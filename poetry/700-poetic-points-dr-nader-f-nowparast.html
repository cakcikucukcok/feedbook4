  <title>700 Poetic Points - Dr. Nader F. Nowparast</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The 700 Points that you are ready to read and enjoy are the English Version of their Farsi (Persian) original version entitled 700 Guftar (Points) versed and translated by Dr. Nader Frank Nowparast.  The Original  Farsi Version was published by Ketab Cor. in Los Angeles, CA in 2007.  It contains 700 Quatrains or Rubaiyat.  The first Quatrain was versed when Dr. Nader F. Nowparast was 17 years old.  In addition to these Quatrains, which have been his favorite poetic style, Dr. Nader. F. Nowparast has versed many Lyrics and Elegies which have been published in Farsi Magazines in Tehran and Southern California.  &lt;p&gt;
       With the exception of 50/60 Translated Quatrains, the remaining are not Rhymed. The rhymed translation of rhymed Farsi poetry in other language is, indeed, severely time-consuming, and most often impossible. Attempting to follow the Farsi Rhyming Rules in translating Farsi Classic Poetry into another language might change the concepts, meanings and the messages expressed in its Farsi version. Although the Classic Farsi Poems are rhymed, but during the past half century many famous Iranian poets have been versing rhyme-free poetry which have been accepted and appreciated by Farsi speaking people worldwide." />
