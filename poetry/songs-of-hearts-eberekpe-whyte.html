  <title>Songs of Hearts - Eberekpe Whyte</title>
      <meta name="description" content="I looked at your pitch and thought  what? Then I suddenly realised: its a poem. Of course! You get so used to reading prose pitches as prcis of stories that you tend to forget there are a million other ways to write a pitch. Firstly, I have to say this is the best set out volume of poetry Ive come across And to the poems themselves? Very well written Blank verse is your forte and you dont privilege yourself in the way that amateur writers often tend to. Your writing is spare and descriptive, evoking an atmosphere... You have some very good lines, too, like these from So What: Confusions in the heaven/ An angel in blue came with a consolation/ And the assurance that there was no big deal about the verification. A skilful use of bathos.&lt;br&gt; 
_____Bren Verrill&lt;br&gt;
The Weird Problem of Good.&lt;p&gt;
This is my song, not your song! This is truly songs of hearts. Very esoteric and captivating&lt;br&gt;
_____Elijah Enyereibe Iwuji&lt;p&gt;
This is beautiful, sad, inspiring, captivating and incredibly well conceived. &lt;br&gt;
_____Elaina&lt;br&gt;
Gathering of Rain&lt;p&gt;
This feels like a very ambitious, honest piece of work&lt;br&gt;
_____Andrew S&lt;p&gt; 
I loved this, I became entirely caught up in itThis is thought provoking and compelling, I didn&#39;t read one poem I didn&#39;t like They are well written, you convey exactly what you want us to feel - I take my hat off to you&lt;br&gt; 
_____Annabelle P&lt;br&gt;
Adelaide Short&lt;p&gt;
It is deep and insightful and stirs a wide range of emotions that brings us to the truth of our souls&lt;br&gt;
