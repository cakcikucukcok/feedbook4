  <title>Of My Time: Selected Memories - Jimmie Choate Parker</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;b&gt;&quot;...a collection of narration and poetry that is such a warming nostalgic trip back through Jim Parker&#39;s interesting life that it makes one wish to write something similar, to recapture the beauty we are afforded in our existence.  It&#39;s a captivating package, written by a talented writer.&quot;	&lt;p&gt;	
Robert Skimin, robertskimin.com, Author of many bestsellers.&lt;p&gt;
&quot;Jimmie Parker&#39;s collections of reflections are bilingual reflections of a well-lived life. Only a life well lived would yield this collection of observations that are eternal in their reach and poetic in their touch.&quot;	&lt;p&gt;
Arnold Garcia Jr., Editorial Page Editor, Austin American-Statesman. &lt;/b&gt; &lt;p&gt;
	This book is a memoir presented through a collection of prose, poetry, photographs, drawings, and a musical composition. &lt;p&gt;
	The first eight pieces are reflective of my feelings, insights, and concerns about certain aspects of the human condition: poverty, man&#39;s inhumanity to man, end of life issues, a search for meaning, and finding one&#39;s spiritual path.&lt;p&gt;
	From the love of a beautiful mother for her children, to the ins and outs of adult love, the next nine pieces, About Love, evoke universal experiences with love.&lt;p&gt;
	The eight pieces in Peace/War demonstrate a strong preference for peace over war. Facing death requires great courage, as does facing life.&lt;p&gt;
	The poem play in section four dramatizes the need for drastic change in the United States of America. My preamble touches on one&#39;s need to handle scarcity and to deal with conflict, both internally and externally; and, the need to find meaning and spirituality in one&#39;s life." />
