  <title>Poems Before &amp; After - Miroslav Holub</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Miroslav Holub was the Czech Republic&#39;s most important poet, and also one of her leading immunologists. His fantastical and witty poems give a scientist&#39;s bemused view of human folly and other life on the planet. Mixing myth, history and folktale with science and philosophy, his plainly written, sceptical poems are surreal mini-dramas often pivoting on paradoxes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Poems Before &amp;amp; After&lt;/i&gt; covers thirty years of his poetry. &lt;i&gt;Before&lt;/i&gt; are his poems from the fifties and sixties, poems written before the Soviet invasion of Czechoslovakia: first published in English in his Penguin &lt;i&gt;Selected Poems&lt;/i&gt; (1967) and in Bloodaxe&#39;s &lt;i&gt;The Fly&lt;/i&gt; (1987), with some additional poems. &lt;i&gt;After&lt;/i&gt; are translations of his later poetry, all written after 1968, including not only those from his two Bloodaxe editions, &lt;i&gt;On the Contrary&lt;/i&gt; (1984) and &lt;i&gt;Supposed to Fly&lt;/i&gt; (1996), but also the entire texts of two late collections published by Faber, &lt;i&gt;Vanishing Lung Syndrome &lt;/i&gt;(1990) and &lt;i&gt;The Rampage&lt;/i&gt; (1997). &lt;i&gt;With additional translations by David Young, Dana Hábová, Rebekah Bloyd and Miroslav Holub.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&#39;A laying bare of things, not so much the skull beneath the skin, more the brain beneath the skull; the shape of relationships, politics, history; the rhythms of affections and disaffection; the ebb and flow of faith, hope, violence, art&#39; – Seamus Heaney&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&#39;Miroslav Holub is one of the half dozen most important poets writing anywhere&#39; – Ted Hughes&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&#39;One of the sanest voices of our time&#39; – A.
