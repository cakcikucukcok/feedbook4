  <title>The Dove in My Window - Regan Potts</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This is my interpretation of the people I have met, places Ive been, and things Ive witnessed. This is my explanation of everything that resonates with me. This is the pain and love I have felt. This has been my therapy, my art, my escape, and my embrace. These are my thoughts and feelings written over the last two years but felt my entire life. This is me coming to terms with things I once deemed unforgivable. This is me sharing the hope I have found. These pages arent organized into chapters because I dont feel as though my life has chapters I can clearly define right now. Sometimes, I am growing in one area and struggling in another, which is why you find poems full of destruction right next to the most hopeful words Ive written. This is how my mind works. This is the beating of my heart in black and white." />
