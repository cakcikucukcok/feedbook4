  <title>Searching for the Light - Charlaine Sweers</title>
      <meta name="description" content="For a long time, I had trouble expressing myself, and so I found a way through writing and expressing feelings through art. It gave me a voice, my way of communicating. For the longest time, I was afraid to share my vulnerabilities, to show my true feelings and thoughts to the people surrounding me. 
I no longer want to be afraid. I want to share my words, my pain, and my sorrow with the world in hope that I can be a voice to someone elses pain and help them with describing their feelings but most of all let them feel that they are not alone. 
Through my storm, Ive found the courage to stand up strong and let others into my world. Not only had it helped me make sense of the mess inside of me, but its also helped others understand why I am the way I am. I can only encourage everyone to find a way to express themselves, whether it be through writing, music, drawing, or paintingwhatever helps let you be free from those demons that live inside you. Let it out and feel free, even if its just for a moment." />
