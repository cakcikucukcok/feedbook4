  <title>The Collected Verse of Robert Service - Robert W. Service</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Robert Service (1874-1958) dreamed of a life of adventure and freedom to live and write as he wanted, surrounded by nature and the beauty of the world. Born in Lancashire, England, he developed an urge early on to travel abroad, and set his sights on the rough and tumble &quot;wild west&quot; of Canada. Part journalist and part storyteller, he ventured up and down the west coast of the United States and wrote romantic stories of cowboys, gold prospectors and characters of the lush, wild backwoods. This collection of verse contains Service&#39;s famous story collections &quot;Songs of a Sourdough&quot;, published in 1907 to wide success, &quot;Ballads of a Cheechako&quot;, &quot;Rhymes of a Rolling Stone&quot;, &quot;Rhymes of a Red Cross Man&quot;, and &quot;Ballads of a Bohemian&quot;. Service favored simple, rhythmic ballads that allowed the reader to get lost in the colorful descriptions and exciting tales of his imagination, which were inspired by his real world experiences." />
