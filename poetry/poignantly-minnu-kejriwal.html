  <title>Poignantly - Minnu Kejriwal</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Poignantly: Poetic Expressions Through Colors Words, and Verses is a collection of poems and paintings that unfolds the unseen and untold painful struggle, fight of the turmoil within, to overcome and to be constructive and productive against all odds, time, and destiny that life chose. The collection is the reaction toward the happening within herself and her surroundings, reflecting her personal space. Her poetic sensibility lures to the documentation of her emotional response in the journey of life.
As an artist, her creative instinct and sensibility toward form, color, and texture explores and redefines the limits of abstraction. Expressing the space within and around, delving deep into the emotions through artistic skills and sensibilities, she conquers the transparency by working with minute sensible layers, overlapping and creating space through color and light in her artworks.
Expressions through both the art forms, the verses, and the visuals transform the authors experiences turning creatively and sensibly into treasures, leaving the soul unscarred and to cherish forever." />
