  <title>Rosey Rose Life Through Poetry - K’ann Strohl</title>
      <meta name="description" content="On October 11th 2003 my niece, Rosemary Joy
Rose was killed in a car accident. Her vehicle caught fire and burned.
Rosemary&#39;s neck was broken, so she died instantly.
How do we say goodbye to a love one without the body?
I decided to write a poem for my niece, Rosemary. This was my way of
saying goodbye.
My sister, Kandy asked me to write a life poem for her favorite 19 pictures
of Rosemary.
I have compiled this book of 21 poems and 19 pictures as a tribute
to Rosemary.
This book conveys her short lived life story.
In conclusion, if you have lost a loved one or friend. I can only hope and
pray that when you read one of Rosemary Joy Rose poems, it will bring
back a fond memory of your loved one or friend." />
