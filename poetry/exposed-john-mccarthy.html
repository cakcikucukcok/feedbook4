  <title>Exposed - John McCarthy</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Who are we? Where do we come from? What is our purpose? These questions have been asked throughout our existence. Ever since the first campfire was lit, we have asked ourselves if we could do better. And we have wondered what lies in the future.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Exposed&lt;/i&gt; is a collection of poetry written by John McCarthy, first as therapy and then as an outlet for a vast expanse of emotions. His perspective has been shaped by thirty years of police and investigation experience and by being an avid hunter and nature enthusiast. This collection is the culmination of a four-year journey that begins with despair over a broken marriage and ends in redemption. Its an honest reflection of lifes experiences and of a search for a higher calling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This poetic journey begins with Somethings Wrong, in which two strangers in a long marriage pass each other as life goes by. They know everything about each other, but they do not really know the things that matterparticularly how to say the things that need to be said. The authors melancholy path takes us through periods of reflection and self-pity, but it closes on a note of hopefulness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Exposed&lt;/i&gt; reveals the poets enlightenment and purposehis love of the mountains and the sea, and inspiration passing through old, lonely country towns that time has forgotten. Experience the world through McCarthys eyes and words: the tragic, the sadness, the lonely, the joy, the redemption, and the beauty.&lt;/p&gt;" />
