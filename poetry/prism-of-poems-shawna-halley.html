  <title>Prism of Poems - Shawna Halley</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Open yourself to possibilities. A closed door cannot let anything in. Be transformed by renewing your mind. Devastation does not have to mean a dead end. It can and will inspire, enlighten, and empower you, revealing unconditional love, power, patience, and abundance Christ is extending to you now. 
Say yes to God. Now look ahead! I dare you to fill your world with peace, love, and hope. See with clarity. Be responsive without doubt or fear. Walk erect with grace and an air of greatness. Everything you need for a happy and successful life is already available. Remember, before you were born, your 
Creator supplied all that you needed to sustain a happy life. 
God created the earth first, then he placed humans on it (Genesis 1:126). 
Now it is at Genesis 1:27 when God formed humans out of the dust male and female. God looked at all that he had created and said, It was good. 
Make an examination of your life. Contemplate for a moment why we all, myself included, at times feel that there is not enough of what we need available? 
What is it that you need at this moment that you do not havenot what you need tomorrow, but what you need now, today? 
Gods Word is truth. Worship him in spirit and truth. God rewards those earnestly seeking him. Theres a bonus section included for those who still believe in romantic love." />
