  <title>Springtime Rhapsody - Umasankar Vadrevu</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Poetry of life cannot be more simply and easily penned down by anyone else more adeptly. Words seem to flow from his mind like dew drops from the heavens above. Every single poem depicts a new perception of life in the best form. The depiction through his poetry encompasses all emotions in a true feeling.
The poet spends most of his working time in the barren deserts of the Middle East. He keeps spinning splendid poetry and brings everyone to wonder the very way his senses have developed. Be it poetry of nature or about friends, lovers or children he has a very distinct signature. 
He has explored and moved in his career from the heat of the foundries to the oil fields from the toughest to the worst terrains. In his spare time he loves to spend time in his own country in the lap of nature. He has developed an innate ability to be able to write some of his best works in the most arid regions of the world.
A few of his works are from his earlier written time somewhere in the late eighties. One of his most recent attempts at writing about the demi god Krishna has been very good. His next in the book is on Immoral Trafficking of Children he also plans at writing a poetry book exclusively on the mythological stories and on foundries but in some time. This may only happen in the next couple of years. 
He is in this book introducing two young poetesses Scarlett Pragya and the other in a little girl Gaurika Mehrotra.
This reverse book comprising of two books Springtime Rhapsody by Umasankar Vadrevu and M@dness and Musings by Scarlett Pragya is the second in the series of books he plans to publish. His first published book is Life Through A Prism." />
