Pass It On is book of poetry and questions that will help you to document what you believe and feel. What you think about the world around you. And what you know about yourself.

Pass It On is a creative process that can be used in many ways to educate others about you. It can bring a better understanding of who you are. It can also bring about a closer bond between you and who you allow to read it.
Pass It On is easy to use, but can be as challenging as you would want it to be- depending on how you decide to answer the questions. Trying to figure out what you want to say and then allowing someone to read your thoughts can be challenging to some. 
Pass It On is about bridging gaps and developing new wonderful relationships. Its about bringing positive supports to the table-for the sole purpose of growing closer to those you love or enriching a new relationship.
