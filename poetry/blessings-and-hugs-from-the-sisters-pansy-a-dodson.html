  <title>Blessings and Hugs from the Sisters - Pansy A. Dodson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;My book came into being quite by accident. My sister, Madeline F. Sparrow, needed some cards to send to her shut-ins. She had over eighty at the time. She had used all that she could find. I said, Why dont I try to write a note of cheer? I always thought about writing short stories. So I started writing verses. Each month, I would sit on my porch or at the kitchen window and think about God and how I felt on the day. I always looked at nature, the birds, squirrels, deer, etc. I wrote how I felt about the changes of the weather and the seasons. Many of those who received these verses responded with notes of thanks for lifting their day. Others were placed on the doors of nursing homes. Several suggested we have them printed into a book.&lt;/p&gt;" />
