  <title>Words of Encouragement 2 - Marcy Blount</title>
      <meta name="description" content="I Marlice Blount(Marcy),was born to George Blount 2 and to the late Betty Jean BaCote. I am one of six siblings. Words Of Encouragement 2 It Aint Over Until God Has The Last Say, is my second book. I use Words Of Encouragement for my title, because while reading my poems to others, they let me know that it helped them go through their daily lives. This book is not only for others, it is for me as well. In my my day to day struggles, after being in a coma, years later had to be paralyzed, ant the surgeries Ive had and still have to endure I realize, the only one I had to call on, when the Doctors gave up on me, my famiy not knowing what to do, and also growing up in church, all I had to do was put my faith and trust in God.   
So these wrds are mainly for me, and to share with others, to let them know, that God is keeping me and He can in will keep them too. In this book, Words Of Encouragemen 2 It Aint Over Until God Has The Last Say, Im also sharing the poems my family wrote, and scriptures from the KJB to let everyone know, that it is a wonderful book and it will help them go through anything. I would like for anyone who reads this book, know that all things are possible if they put their trust in God. He wouldnt put too much on you then you cant bare. As I read these poems and others that Ive written, I want people to feel what I felt. It was God who gave me these words, Im just writing them down. He encourages us all, Im just glad He used me to write these spiritual poems to encourage others as well as myself.                                                   Thank You,                                                                                                                                                                                                                               Marlice Blount" />
