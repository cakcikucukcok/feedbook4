  <title>A Father-And-Son Book of Poetry and Prose - Harry C. James, George A. James</title>
      <meta name="description" content="In the early part of 2012, my dad and I published A Father and Son Book of Poetry and Prose. Now in the late summer of 2017, I am very delighted to share more of what my dad and I have to offer the world through A Father-and-Son Book of Poetry and Prose: Volume II. This is especially for my dad, who passed away in June of this year. I recall some time ago telling him he should make an effort to get his work published. This did not seem to be a great concern of his, but he always enjoyed writing, drawing humorous cartoons, painting on occasion, and simply sharing his creative side with family and friends. I am incredibly grateful to him, and I know I speak for my brothers and my mom too. So I have made it my concern to publish everything I found and know that he has written through poetry.
He is the one that instilled in me an interest in writing and poetry that has lasted for many years now and continues to do so. This creative side of his opened a dimension of creativity to me not just in writing but in all facets of the world around us. He always had an interesting perspective on things that he was not shy about expressing. He was a lifelong Democrat, for instance. At a high school football banquet, one of the other dads, who was also a Democrat, wanted to share a little political banter with my dad. The other dad was basically criticizing everything about the current Republican administration. He figured my dad would comfortably agree with everything he was saying. No way. Although a fellow Democrat, my dad challenged him on every point. He would do this with regularity. He would hear one perspective but was very good at understanding and expressing why the other guy might feel differently.
Another little story I recall goes back a little further to my grade-school days. My mom, myself, and brothers had just gotten in the door from church. Dad had stayed behind to do a little painting around the house. I began sharing how excited I was that my mom had gotten me a new book. He chimed in almost immediately, reminding me how thankful I should be because some kids were not able to receive little gifts from their parents on a consistent basis or at all because they did not have the means. This stopped me in my thoughts, humbled me, and made me think more deeply about life even though I was a young little whippersnapper.
I wish with all my heart I could share this second volume with him and squeeze him with all my might. He is no longer here, but a part of him lives on through my mom and brothers. I wish you could have met him too, but through his poetry, I am so glad you can get to know a piece of him as well. My earthly father is gone now, but as I observe more closely how my heavenly Father allows for the seasons of life to continue and all the legacy and lessons that pertain to this, I am truly a blessed and thankful man." />
