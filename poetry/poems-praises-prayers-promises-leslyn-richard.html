  <title>Poems, Praises, Prayers, Promises - Leslyn Richard</title>

But in order for us to discover just what we were created for, we must consult our Creator. He is the key that unlocks the treasures of talents deep down inside of us all. Our only responsibility is to perfect and use our talents.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;em&gt;Poems, Praises, Prayers, Promises&lt;/em&gt; is a compilation of three decades of writings in which I share a host of modern-day praises, psalms, and hymns. Each poem is a reflection of my experience while encountering people, places and things.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span&gt;This book was written to evangelize everyone, from the lost to the child of God and the theologian.
