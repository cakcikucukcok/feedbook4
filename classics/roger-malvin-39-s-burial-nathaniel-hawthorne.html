  <title>Roger Malvin&#39;s Burial - Nathaniel Hawthorne</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;When two men are gravely injured during the Battle of Pequawket in 1725, one makes a choice that will haunt him for the remainder of his days. Although Reuben and Roger take shelter against a tombstone-shaped rock together, Reuben survives only by leaving his friend to die. Years later, Reuben takes his grown son hunting and is forced to confront his guilt about not keeping his promise to a dying man.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Roger Malvin’s Burial” was adapted into a short radio program in 1949, and was also republished in the collection &lt;em&gt;Mosses from an Old Manse&lt;/em&gt; in 1846. It remains one of Nathaniel Hawthorne’s most moving but least-known short stories.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;HarperPerennial Classics brings great works of literature to life in digital format, upholding the highest standards in ebook production and celebrating reading in all its forms.
