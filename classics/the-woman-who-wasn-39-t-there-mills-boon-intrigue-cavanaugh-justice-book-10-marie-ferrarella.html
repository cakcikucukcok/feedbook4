          &lt;strong&gt;Detective Troy Cavanaugh had never met a woman who didn’t like him — until Agent Delene D’Angelo gave him the cold shoulder at a crime scene. &lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Thrown together by a murder investigation, Troy’s attempts to woo the sexy parole officer were met with staunch disinterest. Delene hadn’t escaped the clutches of her abusive ex just to fall prey to another smooth-talking pretty boy, and Troy Cavanaugh was lethally charming. But that’s where the similarities ended — and Delene was learning that Troy had more beneath the surface.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;When the stakes couldn’t be higher, did she dare risk everything for a chance with this intriguing man?&lt;/p&gt;
