  <title>Edgar Allan Poe: Complete Tales and Poems: The Black Cat, The Fall of the House of Usher, The Raven, The Masque of the Red Death... - Edgar Allan Poe, AtoZ Classics</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This single volume brings together all of Poe&amp;#39;s stories and poems, and illuminates the diverse and multifaceted genius of one of the greatest and most influential figures in American literary history.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Quotes from the book:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Years of love have been forgot, In the hatred of a minute.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Men have called me mad; but the question is not yet settled, whether madness is or is not the loftiest intelligence&amp;ndash; whether much that is glorious&amp;ndash; whether all that is profound&amp;ndash; does not spring from disease of thought&amp;ndash; from moods of mind exalted at the expense of the general intellect.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Is all that we see or seem&lt;br /&gt;
But a dream within a dream?&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Readers&amp;#39; reviews:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Definitely not light reading, but perfect for the fall and winter. Very dark and poetic. Great stories, and each story is just short enough to maintain attention span. I recommend this to anyone who appreciates a challenging read.&amp;rdquo; (Bailey Jane, goodreads.com)&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Edgar Allan Poe, is best known for the Raven, still the greatest and most famous American poem ever written.&amp;rdquo; (Henry Avila, goodreads.com)&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Poe is, whatever you may have gleaned about him from cheap movies and comic book adaptations, a thoroughly top-notch writer in the Romantic tradition.&amp;rdquo; (David, goodreads.com)" />
