&lt;p&gt;
Look inside the book: &lt;p&gt;Having heard that things were in a bad way with us in this temple of the drama this young lady has brought us two pennyworths of German sausage to save us from actual starvation, and has expressed her intention--I don&#39;t quite follow that part, but so far as I can make out she&#39;s proposing to make our fortunes by beginning to be a Wonderful Girl; which it isn&#39;t necessary for her to begin to be, seeing as how I should say that she&#39;s been a Wonderful Girl ever since the moment she was born.&#39;
...She must have been a very sensitive person for a schoolmistress--though I do not know why I should say that, because I have not the least idea why schoolmistresses should not be as sensitive as anybody else, since they are human--for when I began to tell her of how I had expended my capital on the purchase of what that grey-headed man had called his &#39;favourite joint,&#39; she drew me quite close to her, and in the midst of my own anguish I actually felt the tears upon her cheeks. 
...I don&#39;t know much about it, I&#39;m not told everything, and I don&#39;t want to be told, sometimes the less I know the better I&#39;m pleased; but from what I have heard, I should say anger wasn&#39;t the word for it; and that you&#39;re in for about as bad a time as ever you had in all your days!&#39;
&lt;p&gt;About Richard Marsh, the Author:&lt;P&gt; A story about a mysterious oriental figure who pursues a British politician to London, where he wreaks havoc with his powers of hypnosis and shape-shifting, Marsh&#39;s novel is of a piece with other sensational turn of the 19th to 20th century fictions such as Stoker&#39;s Dracula, George du Maurier&#39;s Trilby, and Sax Rohmer&#39;s Fu Manchu novels.   Like Dracula and many of the sensation novels pioneered by Wilkie Collins and others in the 1860s, The Beetle is narrated from the perspectives of multiple characters, a technique used in many late 19th-century novels (those of Wilkie Collins and Stoker, for example) to create suspense and to confuse gender boundaries." />
