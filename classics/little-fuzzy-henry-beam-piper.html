  <title>Little Fuzzy - Henry Beam Piper</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Little Fuzzy is the name of a science fiction novel by Henry Beam Piper. It is generally seen as a work of juvenile fiction. It was nominated for the 1963 Hugo Award for Best Novel.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The story revolves around determining whether a small furry species discovered on the planet Zarathustra is sapient, and features a mild libertarianism that emphasizes sincerity and honesty.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
During a book signing at Strand Book Store, Piper alleged that the Little Fuzzy series was inspired by an acquaintance named Kevin &amp;quot;Fuzzy&amp;quot; Sheffield, whom Piper first met in a literary club in central Oregon. When asked about Sheffield, Piper described him as &amp;quot;a bizarre character, capable of writing little more than a couple of vaguely-legible remarks in each letter. While I&amp;#39;m sure he&amp;#39;s full of insight and great ideas, it seems impossible to effectively communicate with him on a conventional human level...terribly nice fellow however.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The book was followed by a sequel, Fuzzy Sapiens (original title The Other Human Race) published in 1964, the same year that Piper committed suicide in November.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
In the wake of Piper&amp;#39;s suicide, rumor spread of a lost &amp;quot;second sequel&amp;quot;; at the behest of Ace Books, William Tuning produced the critically acclaimed Fuzzy Bones. Later, Piper&amp;#39;s lost manuscript was discovered, and published as Fuzzies and Other People. Ace also hired Ardath Mayhar to write Golden Dreams: A Fuzzy Odyssey, which tells the events of Little Fuzzy from the viewpoint of the Fuzzies (or Gashta, as they call themselves)." />
