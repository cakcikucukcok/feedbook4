  <title>Minerva&#39;s Journey - Dot P. Sticht</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Minervas Journey is the story of a woman in the late 1800s who discovers too late that she has married the wrong man but suffers through indignities he outs on her for more than a decade. She is conscientious about keeping her home clean and neat and loves animals to a fault. Eventually she is told to leave her home that they shared because he doesnt want to be married to her anymore. Her journey continues as she flees for her life to her dear, older friends Maud and Ralph Cochran. There shes given an opportunity to live at her wealthy cousins mansion as a personal seamstress.
In the meantime, throughout many years, the towns constable has loved Minerva from afar but knows that he cant have her because she was married already. He finds the opportunity after her divorce to pursue her. The winter cotillion has him stationed as an officer at the bottom of the main stairs of Col. Homes home, and when Minerva starts down those stairs in her dark-green taffeta dress, the constables breath is taken away. From there, the romance blooms. Minerva still has hard times, but with her new love, she makes it through. She eventually marries the constable, and not long after, she is expecting a child, although they end up with twins
In this story you will see and feel all the emotions of the characters. Readers will cheer for Minerva as she deals with all her trials, as well as her heartfelt tender moments. And there is her love for the constable, Iain McGregor." />
