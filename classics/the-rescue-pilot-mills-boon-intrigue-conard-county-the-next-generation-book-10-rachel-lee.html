          &lt;strong&gt;The plane went down-and sparks are flying…&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;As a Wyoming snowstorm rages around their downed plane, Rory Campbell knows survival should be all that matters. But she can&#39;t deny the desire that sizzles between her and ex-military pilot Chase Dakota. Rory is in capable hands…though it doesn&#39;t stop her from wishing for more than his protection. Chase has flown his share of planes.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;There are no guarantees they&#39;re going to make it to safety—and see Rory&#39;s terminally ill sister to the hospital for an emergency treatment. Despite their dire circumstances, all he can think of is the captivating woman by his side. Dare he lose control long enough to let Rory into his heart?&lt;/p&gt;
