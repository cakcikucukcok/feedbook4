      <meta name="description" content="
        &lt;p&gt;Golden boy Brad Gibson never expected his climb up the corporate ladder would involve dodging bullets. But after he discovered corruption at a leading financial firm, someone wanted his head. Even worse, he feared he was about to lose an exciting opportunity to join the Colby Agency.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Now on Christmas Eve he was locked inside a skyscraper equipped with a state-of-the-art security system alongside Colby receptionist Elaine Younger, a doe-eyed beauty not to be underestimated. But with four masked men intent on bringing the agency to its knees, it was going to be a long night of gunfire and dangling mistletoe before Christmas dawned on the most dangerous couple in Chicago.&lt;/p&gt;
