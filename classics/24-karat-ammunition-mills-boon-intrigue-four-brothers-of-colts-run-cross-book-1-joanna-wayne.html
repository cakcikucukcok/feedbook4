          &lt;strong&gt;No Collingsworth would ever turn his back on a woman in danger.&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Langston Collingsworth was a man to be reckoned with, powerful and president of the family oil business. So when the Collingsworth empire was threatened…it was personal.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;A young girl needed Langston’s help. But her mother was none other than Trish Cantrell – Langston’s school sweetheart. Trish and her daughter were trapped in a blackmail plot and had been on the run since the day Trish gave birth to a Collingsworth heir.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Now it’s up to Langston to protect her child – his child – and face down the trouble headed their way.&lt;/p&gt;
