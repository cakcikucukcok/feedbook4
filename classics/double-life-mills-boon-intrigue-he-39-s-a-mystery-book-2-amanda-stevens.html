          &lt;strong&gt;AN OIL FORTUNE AND AN ILL-FATED HEIR&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Ash Corbett had been gone for twelve years. And now he was back in Jacob&#39;s Pass, Texas, as brash and as beautiful as ever. But something about him wasn&#39;t right. His family knew it…Emma Novick knew it. And what would take DNA typing precious time to reveal, Emma had only to look in his eyes and sample one kiss to know for sure.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;As a child, Emma would watch the grand Corbett parties through the windows and from the trees, catching only glimpses of the gowns and glamour inside. She was the gardener&#39;s daughter, not the sort of girl Ash would ever be attracted to. He was educated and well-bred, the kind of man who commanded respect wherever he went. But he and Emma shared secrets that only intensified over the years. Even though they were little more than strangers now, the passion between them burned strong still. But someone knew about them and would use their forbidden past to forge a new future…without Ash.&lt;/p&gt;
