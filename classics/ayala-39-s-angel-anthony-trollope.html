It was written as a stand-alone novel rather than as part of a series, though several of the minor characters appear in other novels by Trollope.<br /><b><i>Ayala's Angel - Wikipedia</i></b> | As a great fan of Anthony Trollope I am always looking for books by this author that I haven't read and this was the only paperback version of Ayala's Angel I could find. It is a nasty book, badly produced, a strange size, feeling more like a catalogue than a novel and with such small print it is hard to read.<br /><b><i>Amazon.com: Ayala's Angel (9780342415571): Trollope ...</i></b> | Anthony Trollope (1815-1882) was born in London to a bankrupt barrister father and a mother who, as a well-known writer, supported the family. Trollope enjoyed considerable acclaim both as a novelist and as a senior civil servant in the Post Office.<br /><p><h3 align="left">Download Ebook|PDF|Epub of <a href=>Ayala&#39;s Angel - Anthony Trollope</a> </h3></p><hr/>
