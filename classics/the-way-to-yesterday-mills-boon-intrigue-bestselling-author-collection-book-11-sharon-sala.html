          &lt;strong&gt;WHAT IF YOU COULD LIVE ONE DAY OVER AGAIN - AND CHANGE THE OUTCOME?&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Suddenly, unbelievably, Mary Ellen O&#39;Rourke could - and so her wonderful husband and beautiful baby girl were alive and well. Now all she had to do was keep them that way. If only she knew how . But maybe she did. Because a strange encounter with an unusual ring had brought Mary into this parallel world, one in which Daniel and Hope - and she - were the family she&#39;d always dreamed of being. Because it seemed that this time, she had acted differently on that fateful day.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;So was this new life a dream? Mary didn&#39;t care. She&#39;d spent six years praying for a second chance - and she wasn&#39;t going to waste a single minute of it!&lt;/p&gt;
