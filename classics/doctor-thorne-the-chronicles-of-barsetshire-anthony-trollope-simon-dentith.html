  <title>Doctor Thorne: The Chronicles of Barsetshire - Anthony Trollope, Simon Dentith</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Frank has but one duty before him. He must marry money.The squire of Greshamsbury has fallen on hard times, and it is incumbent on his son Frank to make a good marriage.  But Frank loves the doctors niece, Mary Thorne, a girl with no money and mysterious parentage.  He faces a terrible dilemma: should he save the estate, or marry the girl he loves?  Mary, too, has to battle her feelings, knowing that marrying Frank would ruin his family and fly in the face of his mothers opposition. Her pride is matched by that of her uncle, Dr Thorne, who has todecide whether to reveal a secret that would resolve Franks difficulty, or to uphold the innate merits of his own family heritage.The character of Dr Thorne reflects Trollopes own contradictory feelings about the value of tradition and the need for change.  His subtle portrayal, and the comic skill and gentle satire with which the story is developed, are among the many pleasures of this delightful novel.ABOUT THE SERIES: For over 100 years Oxford Worlds Classics has made available the widest range of literature from around the globe.
