          &lt;strong&gt;WHEN A CHILD GOES MISSING…&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Russian beauty Nadia Penn was frantic when her exhusband kidnapped their baby and refused to release her until Nadia turned over government secrets. Nadia would do &lt;em&gt;anything&lt;/em&gt; to get her baby back. But did that include releasing information that could endanger the world&#39;s population?&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Bounty hunter Rex Bettencourt was about to take a much-deserved vacation when a desperate Nadia begged him for help. The vulnerable mother was impossible to refuse–or resist. Now, in a race against time, Rex was determined to bring baby Lily home. But once the case was over, could Rex walk away from the tiny family who&#39;d burrowed their way into his soul?&lt;/p&gt;
