        &lt;p&gt;Falling for him was not an option…&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Because he was bad news. Everything about Jake Norris, from the determined gleam in his eye to his tight, worn denims, screamed rebel &lt;em&gt;with&lt;/em&gt; a cause. And Kylie Riordan knew that Jake&#39;s probing questions–and soul-searing glances–could only lead to trouble. A true crime writer, he was on a mission, investigating a twenty-year-old murder that implicated several powerful men…including Kylie&#39;s father, the senator. If Jake&#39;s instincts were right, Kylie would have to choose between family loyalty and the only man who&#39;d ever seen her for who she really was.&lt;/p&gt;
