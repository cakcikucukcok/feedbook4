  <title>THE TRIAL OF WILLIAM TINKLING - an illustrated children&#39;s book by Charles Dickens - Charles Dickens</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&amp;ldquo;The Trial of William Tinkling&amp;rdquo; Written by Himself at the Age of 8 Years is a popular book by Charles Dickens written in the 1860&amp;rsquo;s.&lt;br /&gt;
Young William Tinkling is the editor of a magazine. He and Nettie Ashford were married in the right-hand closet in the corner of the dancing-school where first we met, with a ring (a green one) purchased from Wilkingwater&amp;#39;s toy-shop.&lt;br /&gt;
His cousin, &amp;ldquo;Lieutenant-Colonel&amp;rdquo; Robin Redforth was united, with similar ceremonies, to Alice Rainbird.&lt;br /&gt;
They find out that Alice and Nettie are &amp;ldquo;being held captive&amp;rdquo; in the dungeon (basement) of Miss Grimmer&amp;#39;s establishment. He and Bob make a vow to free the girls from their captivity. The Colonel is to lead the &amp;ldquo;attack&amp;rdquo; and signal William when he is to commence his, but the Colonel is &amp;ldquo;captured&amp;rdquo; and the signal never comes.&lt;br /&gt;
William is accused of cowardice in the face of the enemy and a court-martial is convened, which takes place with much pomp and ceremony on the grass, under a tree by the pond.&lt;br /&gt;
What was the result of the court-martial and what happened to William you ask? Well, you&amp;rsquo;ll have to download and read this little book to find out.&lt;br /&gt;
