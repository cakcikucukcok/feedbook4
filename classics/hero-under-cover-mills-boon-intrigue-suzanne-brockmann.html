          &lt;strong&gt;When Pete Taylor first offered his services as a bodyguard, Annie Morgan wanted nothing to do with him. &lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;She was sure that the death threats against her weren&#39;t serious. While the Native American mask she was working on was valuable, it wasn&#39;t worth killing for. One murder attempt later, Annie was glad to have Pete around. She owed him her life. Suddenly she was beginning to believe in heroes–and dreams.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;But Pete wasn&#39;t a fantasy–he was real, and at the moment he was the only person she could allow herself to trust, no matter who he was.&lt;/p&gt;
