  <title>Letter To A Hostage - Antoine de Saint, Exupéry</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;b&gt;Letter to a Hostage&lt;/b&gt; is a book by the author Antoine de Saint-Exupéry.&lt;br/&gt;
Saint-Exupéry initially wrote this piece as a preface for his best friend, Léon Werth’s novel: &lt;i&gt;Trente-trois jours&lt;/i&gt; (&lt;i&gt;Thirty Three Days&lt;/i&gt;). Werth had been forced to take refuge in the Jura region of France during the autumn of 1940 because of his Jewish origins. His book, however, could not be published, and so the author significantly revised his preface, removing any direct references to his friend and making him anonymous within the text and a symbol for France as the hostage of the occupying forces. This version was published independently in June 1943. The work is comprised of six short chapters which reflect upon recent aspects of the author’s life (travelling to Portugal, impressions of the Sahara, living in the USA...), and combines references to his friendship with Werth and to his love for his country.&lt;br/&gt;" />
