  <title>Crossing The Line (Mills &amp; Boon Intrigue) - Candace Irvin</title>
      <meta name="description" content="
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;Six weeks earlier, U.S. Army Captain Eve Paris&#39;s entire life had changed when the Black Hawk she was piloting crashed in the Central American jungle, leaving her bruised, battered and wracked with guilt at the loss of her copilot and best friend.&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Her injury had also forced her to rely on the survival skills of her passenger, Captain Rick Bishop, a man she had no business being attracted to, especially once she learned he had helped put her career on the line.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Now, in an attempt to learn what had really happened that fateful day, Eve and Rick had returned to the crash site and vowed to keep their attraction at bay. But being back in enemy territory soon proved safer than revisiting the scene of their first heated kiss.&lt;/p&gt;
