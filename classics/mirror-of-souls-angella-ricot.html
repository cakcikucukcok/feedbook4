  <title>Mirror of Souls - Angella Ricot</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P align=justify&gt;This book is a breakthroughin modern day poetry. It is an eclectic book that reflects contemporary society with its problems and its vision. In this book, the author uses her talent as a gifted poet to paint a rather realistic picture of the human condition, where she also vividly describes the struggle for survival. Within the passages of her poems, the author debates upon the issue of fate versus faith. She also contemplates the nature of truth versus happiness. She offers spiritual hope, and some thoughts on meditation. Throughout the book, the theme is a quest for truth, a quest for freedom: freedom from our daily anguish, freedom from miseries, and from madness. Most importantly, the author also offers insight on the role of the poet today and/or how the poet is viewed within society. &lt;/P&gt;" />
