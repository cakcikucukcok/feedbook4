  <title>Uncle&#39;s Dream - Fyodor Dostoevsky</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Uncle&amp;rsquo;s Dream by Fyodor Dostoyevsky was written following his five year exile to Siberia where he was sent to serve in a hard labor camp. Following what could only have been a harrowing and harsh existence in Russia&amp;rsquo;s infamous prison for political and social prisoners, one would expect Dostoyevsky&amp;rsquo;s work to have been dark and bitter. Rather, Uncle&amp;rsquo;s Dream is a humorous and yet scathing commentary on Russian provincial high-society.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Fyodor Mikhaylovich sometimes transliterated Dostoevsky, was a Russian novelist, journalist, and short-story writer whose psychological penetration into the human soul had a profound influence on the 20th century novel.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Dostoevsky was the second son of a former army doctor. He was educated at home and at a private school. Shortly after the death of his mother in 1837 he was sent to St. Petersburg, where he entered the Army Engineering College. Dostoevsky&amp;#39;s father died in 1839, most likely of apoplexy, but it was rumored that he was murdered by his own serfs. Dostoevsky graduated as a military engineer, but resigned in 1844 to devote himself to writing. His first novel, Poor Folk appeared in 1846.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
That year he joined a group of utopian socialists. He was arrested in 1849 and sentenced to death, commuted to imprisonment in Siberia. Dostoevsky spent four years in hard labor and four years as a soldier in Semipalatinsk, a city in what it is today Kazakhstan.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Dostoevsky returned to St. Petersburg in 1854 as a writer with a religious mission and published three works that derive in different ways from his Siberia experiences: The House of the Dead , (1860) a fictional account of prison life, The Insulted and Injured, which reflects the author&amp;#39;s refutation of naive Utopianism in the face of evil, and Winter Notes on Summer Impressions, his account of a trip to Western Europe." />
