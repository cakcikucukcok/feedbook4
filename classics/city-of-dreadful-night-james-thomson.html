  <title>City Of Dreadful Night - James Thomson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Introduced by Edwin Morgan.  In this haunting poem from the latter part of the nineteenth century, Scots-born writer James Thomson anticipated the modern age&#39;s nightmare vision of the city as a place of loneliness, alienation and spiritual despair. In contrast to the late Victorian confidence all around him, Thomson dared to face the possibility that the universe was utterly indifferent to human affairs. The strange and dark images in The City of Dreadful Night have become a landmark of modern literature, for the tomb-like streets and empty squares in this memorable poem preceded T.S Eliot&#39;s The Waste Land, and the darker visions of expressionism and surrealism by over forty-five years.  Published in instalments in 1874 and then in book form in 1880, The City of Dreadful Night has long been unavailable as a complete text. This exciting new edition is introduced and annotated by Edwin Morgan, long an admirer of Thomson&#39;s work, and a leading modern poet in his own right." />

By James Thomson (Bysshe Vanolis) As I came through the desert thus it was, As I came through the desert: All was black, In heaven no single star, on earth no track; A brooding hush without a stir or note, The air so thick it clotted in my throat; And thus for hours; then some enormous things.<br /><b><i>The City of Dreadful Night by James Thomson… | Poetry ...</i></b> | The City of Dreadful Night is a long poem by the Scottish poet James "B.V." Thomson, written between 1870 and 1873, and published in the National Reformer in 1874, then in 1880 in a book entitled The City of Dreadful Night and Other Poems.<br /><b><i>The City of Dreadful Night - Wikipedia</i></b> | The city of Thomson’s dreadful night is a dark, bleak place defined by the total absence of faith, love, and hope. It is human alienation at its most extreme. It’s a place full of masses of disconnected bodies merely surviving the unrelenting agony of existence. The city, in this case London, is Dante’s Inferno, Victorian style.<br /><p><h3 align="left">Download Ebook|PDF|Epub of <a href=>City Of Dreadful Night - James Thomson</a> </h3></p><hr/>
