  <title>The Fall of the House of Usher and Other Tales - Edgar Allan Poe</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Enter the dark worlds created by Edgar Allen Poe in the collection &quot;The Fall of the House of Usher and Other Tales.&quot; Poe emphasizes morbidity and death through his tales and poems, and this anthology holds all of Poe&#39;s best and most famous works from throughout his career. In &quot;The Fall of the House of Usher,&quot; a man and his sister suffer from a strange, debilitating illness. Her death drives him to the point of madness, and the fragile mansion falls along with the Usher family line. It is Poe&#39;s most famous and well-known story and is a masterpiece of the Gothic literature genre, demonstrating a prime example of the author&#39;s emotional tone and evoking fear, guilt, and trepidation. These same feelings are conjured in the rest of &quot;The Fall of the House of Usher and Other Tales.&quot; &quot;The Tell-Tale Heart&quot; shows how even the most calculating of murders can result in immeasurable guilt. Following the theme of murder, a narrator lures a drunken man to his death in the depths of Italy&#39;s cellars in &quot;The Cask of Amontillado.&quot; For the reader who wants to experience the mystery and macabre nature of early American literature, &quot;The Fall of the House of Usher and Other Tales&quot; is the perfect book to choose." />
