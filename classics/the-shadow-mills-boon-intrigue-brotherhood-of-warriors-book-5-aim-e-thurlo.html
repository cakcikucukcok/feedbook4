  <title>The Shadow (Mills &amp; Boon Intrigue) (Brotherhood of Warriors, Book 5) - Aimée Thurlo</title>
      <meta name="description" content="
        &lt;p&gt;Jonas Slowman knew that better than anyone. He&#39;d left the Navajo Nation to fight overseas as a top-level ranger in the military. His devotion to his heritage brought him back to the reservation, back to the Brotherhood. But they handed him his toughest mission yet.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;&quot;Protect her at all costs,&quot; was the order from the tribe. That Jonas would do with his life. Except his attraction to Emily Atkins was a liability. She&#39;d grown into a confident woman who now found herself the target of an implacable enemy, someone who was using her to get to the Navajo.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Jonas was good at what he did, but he&#39;d need his sharpest edge against a formidable foe. Because he couldn&#39;t risk the consequences to the sacred Brotherhood…or to the woman who&#39;d stealthily claimed his heart.&lt;/p&gt;
