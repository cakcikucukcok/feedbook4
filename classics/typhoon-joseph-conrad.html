Its first book publication was in New York by Putnam in 1902; it was also published in Britain in Typhoon and Other Stories by Heinemann in 1903.<br /><b><i>Typhoon (novella) - Wikipedia</i></b> | Conrad's "Typhoon" comes closer to bringing home that horror than any sea story I have read, and I have read a lot of them. He glides slowly into the battle with nature, faultlessly describing the officers, especially the captain, as they make their way through the China Sea in their 19th century cargo ship.<br /><b><i>Typhoon: Joseph Conrad: 9781976314742: Amazon.com: Books</i></b> | Conrad weaves a tale about a "simple" man. Captain McWhirr takes his ship through an enormous typhoons, and all survive. He finds solutions where "smarter" people see huge problems.<br /><p><h3 align="left">Download Ebook|PDF|Epub of <a href=>Typhoon - Joseph Conrad</a> </h3></p><hr/>
