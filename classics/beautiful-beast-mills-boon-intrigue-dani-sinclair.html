          &lt;strong&gt;Breaking in to the home of the man suspected of killing her father was reckless. &lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;But Cassy Richards had to confront Lieutenant Gabriel Lowe and learn the truth. She found a man with the aura of a predator–and the scars of a wounded soldier. His eyes held a conviction that told her this man was innocent. And by coming there, she&#39;d put them both in imminent danger.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Gabe had lost his memory of the day a bomb exploded, killing the man he&#39;d been ordered to protect and covering the theft of a deadly toxin. He&#39;d retreated to heal from his wounds–and to investigate outside the bounds of military law. Cassy led the enemy to his door. And now the beast would protect his beauty and see that justice was finally served.&lt;/p&gt;
