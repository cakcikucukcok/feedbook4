  <title>The D.H. Lawrence Collection - D.H. Lawrence</title>
      <meta name="description" content="D.H. Lawrence&amp;nbsp;was an English writer and&amp;nbsp;poet.

&lt;br /&gt;
Lawrence&amp;#39;s opinions earned him many enemies and he endured official persecution, censorship, and misrepresentation of his creative work throughout the second half of his life, much of which he spent in a voluntary exile he called his &amp;quot;savage pilgrimage&amp;quot;.
