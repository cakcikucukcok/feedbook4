  <title>The Portrait of a Lady: Volume I - Henry James</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The Portrait of a Lady is a novel by Henry James.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The Portrait of a Lady is the story of a spirited young American woman, Isabel Archer, who in &amp;quot;confronting her destiny&amp;quot; finds it overwhelming. She inherits a large amount of money and subsequently becomes the victim of Machiavellian scheming by two American expatriates. Like many of James&amp;#39;s novels, it is set in Europe, mostly England and Italy. Generally regarded as the masterpiece of James&amp;#39;s early period, this novel reflects James&amp;#39;s continuing interest in the differences between the New World and the Old, often to the detriment of the former. It also treats in a profound way the themes of personal freedom, responsibility, and betrayal.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Isabel Archer, originally from Albany, New York, is invited by her maternal aunt, Lydia Touchett, to visit Lydia&amp;#39;s rich husband, Daniel, at his estate near London, following the death of Isabel&amp;#39;s father. There, Isabel meets her uncle, her friendly invalid cousin Ralph Touchett, and the Touchetts&amp;#39; robust neighbor, Lord Warburton. Isabel later declines Warburton&amp;#39;s sudden proposal of marriage. She also rejects the hand of Caspar Goodwood, the charismatic son and heir of a wealthy Boston mill owner. Although Isabel is drawn to Caspar, her commitment to her independence precludes such a marriage, which she feels would demand the sacrifice of her freedom.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The elder Touchett grows ill and, at the request of his son, leaves much of his estate to Isabel upon his death. With her large legacy, Isabel travels the Continent and meets an American expatriate, Gilbert Osmond, in Florence. Although Isabel had previously rejected both Warburton and Goodwood, she accepts Osmond&amp;#39;s proposal of marriage, unaware that it has been actively promoted by the accomplished but untrustworthy Madame Merle, another American expatriate, whom Isabel had met at the Touchetts&amp;#39; estate.&amp;nbsp;" />
