&lt;p&gt;
Look inside the book: &lt;p&gt;&#39;The Cachalot&#39; (Sperm Whale) &#39;is not only better armed than the True Whale&#39; (Greenland or Right Whale) &#39;in possessing a formidable weapon at either extremity of its body, but also more frequently displays a disposition to employ these weapons offensively and in manner at once so artful, bold, and mischievous, as to lead to its being regarded as the most dangerous to attack of all the known species of the whale tribe.&#39; —FREDERICK DEBELL BENNETT&#39;S WHALING VOYAGE ROUND THE GLOBE, 1840.
...Whenever I find myself growing grim about the mouth; whenever it is a damp, drizzly November in my soul; whenever I find myself involuntarily pausing before coffin warehouses, and bringing up the rear of every funeral I meet; and especially whenever my hypos get such an upper hand of me, that it requires a strong moral principle to prevent me from deliberately stepping into the street, and methodically knocking people&#39;s hats off—then, I account it high time to get to sea as soon as I can.   
&lt;p&gt;About Herman Melville, the Author:&lt;P&gt; Titles republished under the Northwestern-Newberry Library include Typee, Piazza Tales and Other Prose Pieces, Omoo, Israel Potter, Pierre or the Ambiguities, Confidence-Man, White Jacket or the World in a Man-of-War, Moby Dick, Mardi and a Voyage Thither, Redburn, Clarel, as well as several volumes of Melville&#39;s poems, journals, and correspondence.
...His poetry is not as highly critically esteemed as his fiction, although some critics place him as the first modernist poet in the United States; others assert that his work more strongly suggests what today would be a postmodern view.,31 and yet a contemporary Henry Chapin said of his poetry &#39; Melville&#39;s loveable freshness of personality is everywhere in evidence, in the voice of a true poet&#39;." />
