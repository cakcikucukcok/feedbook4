  <title>The Girls in the Water - Victoria Jenkins</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;b&gt;WOW!&lt;/b&gt; This book was &lt;b&gt;fantastic&lt;/b&gt;, I loved it. &lt;b&gt;I literally binge read it because I couldn&#39;t put it down&lt;/b&gt;... if I could give it 6 stars I would.&#39;&amp;#xa0;&lt;i&gt;Bonnie&#39;s Book Talk&amp;#xa0;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;When she woke, she found herself in darkness. She couldn&amp;#x2019;t move. She was going to die and she had no idea why&amp;#x2026;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Early one icy winter morning,&amp;#xa0;&lt;b&gt;Detective Alex King&lt;/b&gt; is called to a murder scene at a local park. The river is running high, and in the water lies the body of a woman, her wrists tied, and all her fingernails missing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The victim, beautiful, young &lt;b&gt;Lola Evans&lt;/b&gt;, had a troubled past, but Alex&amp;#x2019;s team can&amp;#x2019;t find a reason why anyone would want to kill her. The pressure to solve the case keeps mounting, but all their leads run dry. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Then, another body is found in the water.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A disturbing clue suggests how the girls are connected. But who would target such vulnerable girls, and does this mean another life is at risk? Just when Alex thinks she has cracked the case, she realises one of her own team is in terrible danger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Alex is caught in a race against time to reach the next victim before it&amp;#x2019;s too late... and some of her team must face terrifying truths from their own lives if they&amp;#x2019;re to have a chance of catching the killer.&amp;#xa0;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Utterly nail-biting and compelling with a jaw-dropping twist,&amp;#xa0;The Girls in the Water&amp;#xa0;is perfect for fans of&amp;#xa0;Robert Bryndza, Val McDermid, and Mark Billingham.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What readers are saying about &lt;i&gt;The Girls in the Water&lt;/i&gt;:&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#39;&lt;b&gt;Full of twists and turns&lt;/b&gt;, leading to an ending that was both &lt;b&gt;thrilling and filled with tension&lt;/b&gt;.
