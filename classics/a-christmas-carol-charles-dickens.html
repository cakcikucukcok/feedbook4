MARLEY&amp;rsquo;S GHOST.&lt;br /&gt;
Marley was dead: to begin with. There is no doubt whatever about that. The register of his burial was signed by the clergyman, the clerk, the undertaker, and the chief mourner. Scrooge signed it: and Scrooge&amp;rsquo;s name was good upon &amp;rsquo;Change, for anything he chose to put his hand to. Old Marley was as dead as a door-nail.&lt;br /&gt;
Mind! I don&amp;rsquo;t mean to say that I know, of my own knowledge, what there is particularly dead about a door-nail. I might have been inclined, myself, to regard a coffin-nail as the deadest piece of ironmongery in the trade. But the wisdom of our ancestors is in the simile; and my unhallowed hands shall not disturb it, or the Country&amp;rsquo;s done for. You will therefore permit me to repeat," />
