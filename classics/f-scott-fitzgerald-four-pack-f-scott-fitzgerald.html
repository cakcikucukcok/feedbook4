  <title>F. Scott Fitzgerald Four Pack - F. Scott Fitzgerald</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&amp;quot;If I wanted anything, I&amp;#39;d take it... I can&amp;#39;t be bothered resisting things I want.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
~ &lt;i&gt;The Beautiful and Damned.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Fans of &lt;i&gt;The Great Gatsby &lt;/i&gt;author are in for a treat!&amp;nbsp;Included in this bundle: &lt;i&gt;This Side of Paradise, The Beautiful and Damned, The Diamond as Big as the Ritz &lt;/i&gt;and&lt;i&gt; The Curious Case of Benjamin Button.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
THIS SIDE OF PARADISE&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
First published in 1920, F. Scott Fitzgerald&amp;rsquo;s debut novel was a sizzling sensation that put the young American author on the map. Its initial printing of 3,000 copies sold out in three days.&amp;nbsp;Virtually a record of the &amp;lsquo;Lost Generation&amp;rsquo; in its college days, the novel explores Fitzgerald&amp;rsquo;s characteristic theme of true love blighted by money lust and is remarkable for its honest and detailed descriptions of the early Jazz Age.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
THE BEAUTIFUL AND THE DAMNED&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
First published in 1922, F. Scott Fitzgerald&amp;#39;s second novel portrays the Eastern elite during the Jazz Age, exploring New York Caf&amp;eacute; Society. The story is believed to be largely based on Fitzgerald&amp;#39;s stormy relationship with Zelda Fitzgerald.&amp;nbsp;This is the tale of young couple Anthony and Gloria Patch living out their days to the hilt in New York City as they await the death of Anthony&amp;#39;s grandfather, Adam Patch from whom they expect to inherit his massive fortune.&amp;nbsp;They drink and eat in the classiest restaurants and hotels, rent the most expensive apartments, travel out to the West in the spring time driving plush cars, wearing top-of-the-line clothing and just generally living it up high on the hog, as they wait.&amp;nbsp;But as time goes on their lust for life and their similarities threaten to destroy their innocence and their relationship.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
THE DIAMOND AS BIG AS THE RITZ&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
First published in the June 1922 issue of &lt;i&gt;The Smart Set &lt;/i&gt;magazine, &lt;i&gt;The Diamond as Big as The Ritz&lt;/i&gt; is one of F. Scott Fitzgerald&amp;rsquo;s under-rated masterpieces. The story was initially rejected by publishers because of its not-so-subtle satirical messages about American capitalism.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
THE CURIOUS CASE OF BENJAMIN BUTTON&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The classic short story was first published in Colliers Magazine on May 27, 1922. It was subsequently anthologized in Fitzgerald&amp;#39;s book &lt;i&gt;Tales of the Jazz Age&lt;/i&gt;. This is the original version of the story used for the 2008 film starring Brad Pitt." />
