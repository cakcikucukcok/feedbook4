  <title>The Oedipus plays of Sophocles: Oedipus the King; Oedipus at Colonus; Antigone - Sophocles</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Sophocles was born at Colonus, near Athens in about 496 BC and is considered to be one of the premier playwrights of Greek tragedy. His stories may have been filled with strife, but Sophocles himself was prosperous and came from a good family. It is said that he was handsome, wealthy, and a highly respected citizen of Athens. During his life, he wrote over 120 plays and was instrumental in how plays would eventually be performed, including the addition of stage props. Sophocles&#39; great Theban trilogy has all the intensity and power that you have come to expect from a Greek tragedy. Produced in colorful and poetic language, this is the story of a noble family catapulted into tragedy and loss of power, a story of pride, cursed with the stain of incest, murder, and suicide. Sophocles&#39;s plays are the pillars of ancient Greek drama and have been enthralling readers and theater goers since the fifth century." />
