          &lt;strong&gt;A Christmas reunion? &lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;When Nick discovers his twin boys have been kidnapped, he vows to do whatever it takes to get them back…even if that means facing his ex-wife and the attraction he thought he buried months ago. Having her ex-husband back in her life was not what Becky Collingsworth asked Santa for this year.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Determined to remain aloof, Becky works with Nick to find their sons. But what will she do about the onslaught of emotions she still feels for her irresistible ex?&lt;/p&gt;
