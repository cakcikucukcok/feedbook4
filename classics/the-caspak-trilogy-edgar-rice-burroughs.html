  <title>The Caspak Trilogy - Edgar Rice Burroughs</title>
      <meta name="description" content="While he was best known for the &amp;quot;Tarzan of the Apes&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Barsoom&amp;quot; series, Edgar Rice Burroughs true brilliance bursts forth in the Caspak Trilogy. In this trilogy, which includes &amp;quot;The Land that Time Forgot,&amp;quot; &amp;quot;The People that Time Forgot,&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Out of Time&amp;#39;s Abyss,&amp;quot; we have Burroughs at his very best. This adventure streaks onward like a bullet to its jaw-dropping end. The Caspak trilogy, set during World War I, begins with the discovery of Bowen J. Tyler&amp;#39;s worn manuscript floating in a bottle off the coast of Greenland. The manuscript reveals that Bowen and his companions were taken captive by a German submarine. The harrowing submarine ride leads to the discovery of a subterranean passageway to a most incredible land. This land, called Caspak by its inhabitants, is a microcosm of millions of years of evolutionary progress - with winged, humanlike creatures, dinosaurs, ferocious beasts of prey, Neanderthals, &amp;quot;wild ape-men,&amp;quot; and monstrous reptiles.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Ray Bradbury was a huge fan of Burroughs, as can be seen in the following quote: &amp;quot;We may have liked Verne and Wells and Kipling, but we loved, we adored, we went quite mad with Mr. Burroughs.&amp;quot; Bradbury was certainly not alone in his admiration of Burroughs as over the years countless directors, producers, actors, and writers have drawn inspiration from his writings. Burroughs&amp;#39; influence can still be seen nearly 60 years after his death. Spielberg&amp;#39;s &amp;quot;Jurassic Park&amp;quot;, Peter Jackson&amp;#39;s &amp;quot;King Kong&amp;quot;, and Tim Burton&amp;#39;s &amp;quot;Planet of the Apes&amp;quot; all owe a debt of gratitude to Mr. Burroughs." />
