&lt;p&gt;
Look inside the book: &lt;p&gt;I cried and cried as if my heart would break, and at last he came and put his hand upon my head--when I set myself to do it, and stuck at it, I could twist him round my finger!--and he began to stroke my hair--I&#39;d lovely hair then, no woman ever had lovelier, and he was always one to stroke it when I&#39;d let him!--and he said, &#39;My girl, how often shall I have to forgive you?&#39; 
...It was latish when I came back; I hadn&#39;t enjoyed myself one bit, and left in a temper and came off home by myself I let myself in at the front door, and when I came into this room, on the table just here&#39;--she pointed with her finger--&#39;there was a pillow, and on the pillow was the baby, and he was kneeling on the floor in front, his elbows on the table, and his face on his hands, and the tears streaming down his cheeks as if they&#39;d never stop. 
...&#39;Well--I don&#39;t know that I am exactly afraid, but if you ask me if being woke in the middle of the night, to be told there&#39;s burglars in the house, is the kind of thing I&#39;m fond of, I&#39;ll admit it isn&#39;t.&#39;
&lt;p&gt;About Richard Marsh, the Author:&lt;P&gt; A story about a mysterious oriental figure who pursues a British politician to London, where he wreaks havoc with his powers of hypnosis and shape-shifting, Marsh&#39;s novel is of a piece with other sensational turn of the 19th to 20th century fictions such as Stoker&#39;s Dracula, George du Maurier&#39;s Trilby, and Sax Rohmer&#39;s Fu Manchu novels.   Like Dracula and many of the sensation novels pioneered by Wilkie Collins and others in the 1860s, The Beetle is narrated from the perspectives of multiple characters, a technique used in many late 19th-century novels (those of Wilkie Collins and Stoker, for example) to create suspense and to confuse gender boundaries." />

But this is Marsh in a completely different mood - humorous and entertaining. Tom Ossington's Ghost is a ghost story, a love story, and maybe tale with a moral. Very light, the sort of thing the Victorians read to relax.<br /><b><i>Tom Ossington's Ghost: Marsh, Richard: 9781519716668 ...</i></b> | Richard Marsh (12 October 1857 – 9 August 1915) was the pseudonym of the English author born Richard Bernard Heldmann.
