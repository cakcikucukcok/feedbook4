  <title>Main Street - Sinclair Lewis</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Main Street&lt;/em&gt; by Sinclair Lewis satirises the American romanticising of small town life. When Carol Milford marries Dr. Will Kennicott, she agrees to leave her bustling metropolitan life and relocate to his small hometown. However, she is soon horrified by the smugly conservative and often backwards attitudes in Gopher Prairie, Minnesota. A witty and humorous battle between small town gossips and a fiercely independent young woman, &lt;em&gt;Main Street&lt;/em&gt; was a massive success when it was published in 1920 and was cited by the jury when Lewis was awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1930, the first American to ever be honoured with the award.&lt;/p&gt;" />

Satirizing small town life, Main Street is perhaps Sinclair Lewis's most famous book, and led in part to his eventual 1930 Nobel Prize for Literature. It relates the life and struggles of Carol Milford Kennicott in the small town of Gopher Prairie, Minnesota, as she comes into conflict with the small-town mentality of its residents.<br /><b><i>Main Street (novel) - Wikipedia</i></b> | Sinclair Lewis’s Main Street is a long meditation on this peculiarly American combination of freedom and rigidity. It’s a big, sprawling book with no discernible plot, like a soap opera; but it’s lack of plot seems carefully planned.<br /><b><i>Main Street (Signet Classics): Lewis, Sinclair, Killough ...</i></b> | Main Street [Sinclair Lewis] on Amazon.com. *FREE* shipping on qualifying offers.
