  <title>The Burning Hand - Jodi Meadows</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The city of Skyvale&#39;s problems have reached the palace. Told from the perspective of Tobiah, the crown prince with a dangerous secret, and set two years before the heart-racing action of &lt;em&gt;The Orphan Queen&lt;/em&gt;, this 100-page digital novella brings to life one of Jodi Meadows&#39;s most beloved characters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tobiah Pierce is no longer simply a prince. He wanted to be more and do more after he watched his tutor&#39;s brutal murder and uncovered a plot that threatens the safety of Skyvale. With the help of his cousin, James, and the guidance of a girl who knows her way around the city&#39;s rooftops, Tobiah is gaining confidence in his new role. He can no longer be just a witness to the evils occurring in his city, but is he willing to risk his reputation&amp;#8212;and maybe even his life&amp;#8212;to make things right?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Burning Hand&lt;/em&gt; is the third of four prequel novellas that offer existing fans a deeper insight into a favorite character and the complex city of Skyvale, while new readers will find a stunning introduction to this rich world and the heart-pounding fantasy of the Orphan Queen series.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Epic Reads Impulse is a digital imprint with new releases each month.&lt;/p&gt;" />
