  <title>THE YOUNGER SISTER Vol 3 - Jane Austen, Catherine Anne Austen Hubback</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This is the third volume (of three) in the completion of Jane Austen&amp;rsquo;s series &amp;ldquo;THE WATSONS&amp;rdquo; by her niece Catherine Hubback-Austen.&lt;br /&gt;
The series is a wonderful coming of age tale by Jane Austen and her niece, Catherine. A comedy of manners, it is a classic piece by the author of a number of tales about young women finding their way in society - not to be missed.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
=================&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Catherine Anne Hubback (7 July 1818 &amp;ndash; 25 February 1877) was an English novelist, and the eighth child and fourth daughter of Sir Francis Austen (1774-1865), and niece of JANE AUSTEN.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
She began writing fiction to support herself and her three sons after her husband John Hubback was institutionalized with a breakdown.&lt;br /&gt;
She had copies of some of her aunt&amp;#39;s unfinished works and, in 1850, remembering Austen&amp;#39;s proposed plot, she wrote The Younger Sister, a completion of Jane Austen&amp;#39;s THE WATSONS. In the next thirteen years, she completed nine more novels.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
She emigrated to California, USA in 1870. In the autumn of 1876 she removed to Gainesville, Prince William Co, VA, where she died in 1877." />
