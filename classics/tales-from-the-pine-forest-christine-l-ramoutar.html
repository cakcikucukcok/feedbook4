  <title>Tales from the Pine Forest - Christine L. Ramoutar</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;In a faraway pine forest on the island of Trinidad lives a lovely red squirrel family. Their home is a cosy, warm hole on Honey Nut Bough in a tall and sturdy pine tree. Mrs. Nimbly Knock and her three little squirrels, Quickskip, Chuckles, and Hopscotch, have a happy lifeuntil Mr. Nimbly Knock goes hunting for nuts in the forest one day and never returns. Deeply saddened by his disappearance, Mrs. Nimbly Knock lets Mr. Twinkle Tip, a friendly, old star who loves the forest animals, stay with them as a special family friend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Mr. Twinkle Tip settles comfortably into his new home inside a quaint lantern in the tree, the young squirrels begin to learn how to survive in the pine forest. When a pile of cashew nuts goes missing, Mr. Twinkle Tip puts a spell on the front door and quickly catches Mr. Squeak, a rat with a greedy appetite for cashew nuts, illustrating to the three little squirrels an important message about honesty and trust. As Quickskip, Chuckles, and Hopscotch begin to explore the world outside their beloved pine tree, they learn valuable lessons from their mother and Mr. Twinkle Tip about avoiding greed, valuing family love, caring for others, being a good friend, being neighbourly, being tactful, and staying safe in the forest. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this delightful collection of short tales, the charming Nimbly Knock squirrel family teaches children essential values for life and that making good choices is always the right thing to do.&lt;/p&gt;" />
