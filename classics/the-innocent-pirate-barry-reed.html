  <title>The Innocent Pirate - Barry Reed</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The Innocent Pirate is set in rural Heard County, Georgia, during
the late 1960s. The fictional characters in this book are written using
local social color. The country was in civil turmoil as the Vietnam War
raged on and many in our society called for the release of patients
from mental institutions. During this period, the very social fabric of
our country was falling apart as children were increasingly being born
outside of marriage or became the victims of broken marriages.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
The main character, Dewey, is mildly retarded and a victim of social
engineering called eugenics, where upon he was denied any hope of
having children. At fifteen, he was thrust upon his widower grandfather,
Al, who was a retired Navy Chief living on a farm.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Dewey befriends a group of children who live in the nearby Robins
Nest Trailer Park. Many adventures take place as Dewey spends his
first summer on the farm with his grandfather. He becomes an unlikely
hero, witness to horrible acts of human destruction, and an unexpected
provider of justice.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Everyone fourteen to one-hundred years old will enjoy this period
classic as it stirs their imagination and old memories." />
