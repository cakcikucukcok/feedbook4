In a little district west of Washington Square the streets have run crazy and broken themselves into small strips called &amp;quot;places.&amp;quot; These &amp;quot;places&amp;quot; make strange angles and curves. One Street crosses itself a time or two. An artist once discovered a valuable possibility in this street. Suppose a collector with a bill for paints, paper and canvas should, in traversing this route, suddenly meet himself coming back, without a cent having been paid on account!&lt;br /&gt;
So, to quaint old Greenwich Village the art people soon came prowling, hunting for north windows and eighteenth-century gables and Dutch attics and low rents. Then they imported some pewter mugs and a chafing dish or two from Sixth Avenue, and became a &amp;quot;colony.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
At the top of a squatty, three-story brick Sue and Johnsy had their studio. &amp;quot;Johnsy&amp;quot; was familiar for Joanna. One was from Maine; the other from California. They had met at the table d&amp;#39;hte of an Eighth Street &amp;quot;Delmonico&amp;#39;s,&amp;quot; and found their tastes in art, chicory salad and bishop sleeves so congenial that the joint studio resulted.&lt;br /&gt;
That was in May. In November a cold, unseen stranger, whom the doctors called Pneumonia, stalked about the colony, touching one here and there with his icy fingers. Over on the east side this ravager strode boldly, smiting his victims by scores, but his feet trod slowly through the maze of the narrow and moss-grown &amp;quot;places.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
Mr. Pneumonia was not what you would call a chivalric old gentleman. A mite of a little woman with blood thinned by California zephyrs was hardly fair game for the red-fisted, short-breathed old duffer. But Johnsy he smote; and she lay, scarcely moving, on her painted iron bedstead, looking through the small Dutch window-panes at the blank side of the next brick house.&lt;br /&gt;
One morning the busy doctor invited Sue into the hallway with a shaggy, gray eyebrow.&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;She has one chance in - let us say, ten,&amp;quot; he said, as he shook down the mercury in his clinical thermometer. &amp;quot; And that chance is for her to want to live. This way people have of lining-u on the side of the undertaker makes the entire pharmacopoeia look silly. Your little lady has made up her mind that she&amp;#39;s not going to get well. Has she anything on her mind?&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;She - she wanted to paint the Bay of Naples some day.&amp;quot; said Sue.&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Paint? - bosh! Has she anything on her mind worth thinking twice - a man for instance?&amp;quot;" />

  	<div class="indent justify" style="visibility:hidden"><b><i>The Best Short Stories - 7 - Joseph Conrad, O. Henry, Anton Chekhov, Edgar Allan Poe...</i></b> | Conrad should be known for more than 'Heart of Darkness'. As good a book as it is, it shows only a minute glimpse of what he is capable of. The delicacy, humor, wit, and sheer beauty he shows in this collection marks him as one of the most talented writers of his time, and with one of the most unique voices.<br /><b><i>Complete Short Stories by Joseph Conrad - Goodreads</i></b> | Joseph Conrad (1857 - 1924) was a Polish author who wrote in English. A feat made even more remarkable when we consider that he was not even fluent in English until he was in his twenties -- and even then he spoke with a heavy Polish accent.<br /><b><i>Joseph Conrad - Short Stories and Classic Literature</i></b> | Anton Pavlovich Chekhov (1860–1904), a Russian physician, short-story writer, and playwright, wrote hundreds of stories that delved beneath the surface of Russian society, exposing the hidden motives of his characters and the ways in which prevailing social forces influenced their lives.<br /><p><h3 align="left">Download Ebook|PDF|Epub of <a href=>The Best Short Stories - 7 - Joseph Conrad, O.
