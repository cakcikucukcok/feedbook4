  <title>House of Savera - Ashraf Jafri</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The book deals with characters located in three different worlds during 1960s. The characters come from totally different backgrounds, though there is one thing common in all, they are all in universities doing research or learning, they all have a wider horizon and broad social spectrum. Their work is recognized internationally. Inter national weddings take place in three different countries in three different cultures, love and and respect over come the differences. This book tries to bring unsolved health problems, at the same time coaxes the medical segment to do more work. The author has almost lost his right eye and deals with it in the character of Karl Schoulz. The book opens another chapter called, &quot; Human and animal communication and understanding&quot; through African gray parrots, developing a two way communication, in fact these parrots are known to mimic every sound and seem to understand humans.&lt;br&gt;" />
