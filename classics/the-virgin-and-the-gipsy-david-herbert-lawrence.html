  <title>The Virgin and the Gipsy - David Herbert Lawrence</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&amp;quot;The Virgin and the Gipsy&amp;quot; was discovered in France after David Herbert Lawrence&amp;#39;s death in 1930. Immediately recognised as a masterpiece in which Lawrence had distilled and purified his ideas about sexuality and morality, &amp;quot;The Virgin and the Gipsy&amp;quot; has become a classic and is one of Lawrence&amp;#39;s most electrifying short novels.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Set in a small village in the English countryside, this is the story of a secluded, sensitive rector&amp;#39;s daughter who yearns for meaning beyond the life to which she seems doomed. When she meets a handsome young gipsy whose life appears different from hers in every way, she is immediately smitten and yet still paralysed by her own fear and social convention. Not until a natural catastrophe suddenly, miraculously sweeps away the world as she knew it does a new world of passion open for her.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Lawrence&amp;#39;s spirit is infused by all his tenderness, passion, and knowledge of the human soul.&lt;br /&gt;

  	<div class="indent justify" style="visibility:hidden"><b><i>The Virgin and the Gipsy - David Herbert Lawrence</i></b> | In this book, Lawrence is in usual top form in describing the longing of a young girl, a virgin, for the slightly unconventional. Her vision of her future being a stayed and commonplace marriage to one of the local boys of character and money, she longs for something else before that fate befalls her. She does find that love, very much by accident.<br /><b><i>The Virgin and the Gipsy: Lawrence, David Herbert ...</i></b> | The Virgin and the Gipsy is a short novel (or novella) by English author D.H. Lawrence. It was written in 1926 and published posthumously in 1930. Today it is often entitled The Virgin and the Gypsy which can lead to confusion because first and early editions had the spelling "Gipsy".<br /><b><i>The Virgin and the Gypsy - Wikipedia</i></b> | The Virgin and the Gipsy was discovered in France after D.
