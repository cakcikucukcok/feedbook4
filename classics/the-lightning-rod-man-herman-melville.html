Herman Melville (August 1, 1819 – September 28, 1891) was an American writer best known for the novel Moby-Dick. His first three books gained much contemporary attention (the first, Typee, became a bestseller), but after a fast-blooming literary success in the late 1840s, his popularity declined precipitously in the mid-1850s and never recovered during his lifetime.<br /><b><i>The Lightning-Rod Man: Melville, Herman: 9781494285975 ...</i></b> | This short story was original, and also very quirky, exactly what I'd expect from Melville, the story is about a strange man who comes to the narrators door trying to sell a lightning rod during a thunder storm.<br /><b><i>The Lightning-Rod Man by Herman Melville</i></b> | The Lightning-Rod Man What grand irregular thunder, thought I, standing on my hearthstone among the Acroceraunian hills, as the scattered bolts boomed overhead and crashed down among the valleys, every bolt followed by zigzag irradiations, and swift slants of sharp rain, which audibly rang, like a charge of spear-points, on my low shingled roof.<br /><p><h3 align="left">Download Ebook|PDF|Epub of <a href=>The Lightning-Rod Man - Herman Melville</a> </h3></p><hr/>
