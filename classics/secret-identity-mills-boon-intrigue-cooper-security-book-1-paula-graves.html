      <meta name="description" content="
        &lt;p&gt;Since leaving the CIA under questionable circumstances, Amanda Caldwell has been living a quiet, uneventful life in a sleepy mountain town. But when Rick Cooper, her former partner–and former lover–makes an unexpected reappearance, she senses things are about to get a lot more interesting.…&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Rick&#39;s mission is to protect Amanda and her identity from an assassin who&#39;s picked up her trail. It isn&#39;t long before working together stirs up all the passion and energy they&#39;d once shared on the job. And in Rick&#39;s bed. Still, there&#39;s more to Rick&#39;s assignment than he can share with his &quot;partner.&quot; Revealing the truth wouldn&#39;t be smart. But keeping his secret could be deadly.&lt;/p&gt;
