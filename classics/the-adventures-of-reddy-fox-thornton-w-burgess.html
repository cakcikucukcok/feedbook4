  <title>The Adventures of Reddy Fox - Thornton  W. Burgess</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;These delightful stories created by the writer known famously as the Bedtime Story Man provide hours of endless enjoyment for readers both young and old. His daily newspaper column which he wrote without a break from 1912 through to 1960 featured a host of engaging characters and their lively pranks and doings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this charmingly illustrated volume, Reddy Fox, the young hero is sent to stay with his grandma. Grandmother Fox is the &amp;ldquo;wisest, slyest and smartest fox in all the country around&amp;rdquo; and she takes it upon herself to educate Reddy in the things that every fox should know! Thus begins a battle of wits between Farmer Brown, Farmer Brown&amp;#39;s Boy, Reddy and Grandmother Fox. Interspersed with each story are tiny nuggets of valuable lessons on life&amp;mdash;the dangers of pride and boastfulness, the value of friendship and loyalty, the perils of disobedience, nature&amp;#39;s laws, kindness to others even though they may be our enemies and other such wonderful bits of folksy wisdom.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Born in 1874, Thornton Burgess was a passionate and keen American conservationist and naturalist who was brought up by his mother in straitened circumstances after his father&amp;#39;s early death. The young Thornton worked at a variety of odd jobs to put himself through school and college and help his mother run the house. One of his jobs was located in a wooded area near the town and it was here that Thornton developed his passion for wildlife, nature and conservation.&lt;/p&gt;" />
