  <title>Treasure Island (Illustrated by Elenore Plaisted Abbott with an Introduction and Notes by Clayton Hamilton) - Robert Louis Stevenson, Elenore Plaisted Abbott</title>
      <meta name="description" content="One of the most beloved adventure stories of all time, “Treasure Island” is a swashbuckling tale of the search for hidden treasure. When an old sea captain by the name of Billy Bones dies at the Admiral Benbow Inn on the west coast of England during the mid-1700s, Jim Hawkins, the innkeeper’s son, and his mother discover a treasure map among his belongings. Jim shows the map to some local acquaintances, Dr. Livesey and Squire Trelawney and together they plan an expedition to find the treasure. Together they set sail aboard the “Hispaniola” led by Captain Smollett in search of Treasure Island. Amongst the crew are numerous former pirates, who are led to mutiny by “Long John” Silver, a one-legged Bristol tavern-keeper who has been hired as the ship’s cook. Written in the late 19th century, Robert Louis Stevenson’s “Treasure Island” dramatically depicts maritime life, rich with all its perils, in an adventure that investigates the nature of good and evil itself. This edition is illustrated by Elenore Plaisted Abbot, includes an introduction and notes by Clayton Hamilton, and a biographical afterword." />
