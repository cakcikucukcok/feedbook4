  <title>Mark Twain&#39;s Adventures of Tom Sawyer: The NewSouth Edition - Alan Gribben</title>
      <meta name="description" content="In a radical departure from standard editions, the coming-of-age story that introduces Mark Twain&#39;s two most enduring literary characters - Tom Sawyer and Huckleberry Finn - is published here with its disturbing racial labels translated as &quot;slave&quot; and &quot;Indian.&quot; Everything else is completely intact in a novel that Twain termed a &quot;hymn to boyhood.&quot; Tom and Huck fish and swim in the Mississippi River, search for buried treasure, and hide in a haunted house. Around the edges of this idyllic boy-life, however, loom dangerous events in the fictional village of St. Petersburg: Tom and Huck witness a midnight murder in a graveyard, the killer escapes from the courtroom while Tom is testifying, and two sinister villains plot robbery and revenge against a wealthy widow. Readers can follow the boys&#39; adventures without confronting the dozens of racial slurs that are available in other editions of the book. The editor supplies a historical and literary introduction as well as a guide to Twain&#39;s satirical targets." />
