  <title>Rescue at Cardwell Ranch (Mills &amp; Boon Intrigue) - B.J. Daniels</title>
      <meta name="description" content="
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;The highly anticipated continuation of the &lt;/strong&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;
            &lt;em&gt;Cardwell Ranch &lt;/em&gt;
          &lt;/strong&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;Collection read by more than 2 MILLION!&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;Saving her once was risky. Rescuing her again may be fatal.&lt;/strong&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;When Hayes Cardwell arrived in Big Sky, Montana, for his brother&#39;s wedding, the Texas P.I. didn&#39;t expect to play hero. But ever since he saved her from a brutal abductor, he can&#39;t get McKenzie Sheldon out of his mind and heart. As passion blindsides him, Hayes vows to protect the beautiful business owner from once again becoming the target of a killer intent on finishing the job.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;McKenzie was drawn to Hayes from the moment she awoke and saw the tall, dark cowboy who&#39;d rushed to her rescue like some Western fantasy. With his lean, sexy looks and fierce protective instincts, the gun-shy bachelor is already lassoing her heart. But can he protect her from a danger that&#39;s much closer than they think…a killer hiding in plain sight who&#39;s about to spring a final trap?&lt;/p&gt;
