  <title>Wives and Daughters - Elizabeth Cleghorn Gaskell</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&amp;quot;Wives and Daughters&amp;quot; is a novel by Elizabeth Cleghorn Gaskell first published serially in &lt;i&gt;The Cornhill Magazine&lt;/i&gt; (August 1864&amp;ndash;January 1866) and then in book form in 1866. The novel was unfinished at the time of her death in November 1865.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
Known as her last, longest, and perhaps finest work, it concerns the interlocking fortunes of several families in the country town of Hollingford.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Wives and Daughters&amp;quot; is far more than a nostalgic evocation of village life, it is a fantastic ironic critique of mid-Victorian society.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Set in English society before the 1832 Reform Bill, &amp;quot;Wives and Daughters&amp;quot; centres on the story of youthful Molly Gibson, brought up from childhood by her father. When he remarries, a new step-sister enters Molly&amp;#39;s quiet life &amp;ndash; lovable, but worldly and troubling, Cynthia. The narrative traces the development of the two girls into womanhood within the gossiping and watchful society of Hollingford." />
