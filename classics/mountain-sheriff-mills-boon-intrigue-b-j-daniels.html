  <title>Mountain Sheriff (Mills &amp; Boon Intrigue) - B.J. Daniels</title>
      <meta name="description" content="
        &lt;p&gt;Rain and isolation could make folks crazy in these parts. Sheriff Mitch Tanner–the most eligible bachelor in the county–would have his hands full for sure. Bigfoot sightings and sundry strange happenings he could handle…&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;but he wasn&#39;t prepared for murder. With a killer on the loose, he&#39;d have to keep a tight grip on the investigation and a close eye on the mounting list of suspects. Unfortunately, the person causing the most trouble to his male senses was none other than the town&#39;s biggest gossip and the one woman he&#39;d do anything to avoid: Charity Jenkins. Sure enough, she&#39;d whittled away at his confirmed-single status with her annoying questions and all-American-girl good looks and had him thinking about something more permanent. Except a killer had other plans for Charity.&lt;/p&gt;
