From the first, 'the narrator' employs Neville Shute's expert knowledge of aero-mechanics. This makes the narrator seem like a practical "nuts-and-bolts" man. He is interested in carving out a post-war niche in air transport flying goods and services across the Middle East.<br /><b><i>Round the Bend: Shute, Nevil: 9781987415834: Amazon.com: Books</i></b> | Round the Bend is a 1951 novel by Nevil Shute. It tells the story of Constantine "Connie" Shaklin, an aircraft engineer who founds a new religion transcending existing religions based on the merit of good work. It deals with racism, including the White Australia policy, and also with the importance of private enterprise. It was one of the first novels Shute wrote after emigrating from Britain to Australia in 1950.<br /><b><i>Round the Bend (novel) - Wikipedia</i></b> | "Round the Bend" is from my point a profound piece of writing.
