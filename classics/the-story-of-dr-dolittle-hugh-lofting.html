  <title>The Story of Dr. Dolittle - Hugh Lofting</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Doctor Dolittle loves animals.  In fact, he loves animals so much that his cozy cottage in Puddleby-on-the-Marsh is bursting with pets: goldfish in the pond, rabbits in the pantry, white mice in the piano, a squirrel in the linen closet, a hedgehog in the cellar, not to mention a horse, chickens and pigeons, two lambs, and many others.  But his favorite pets by far are Dab-Dab the duck, Jip the dog, Gub-Gub the baby pig, Polynesia the parrot, and Too-Too the owl.  It&#39;s no wonder no &lt;i&gt;human &lt;/i&gt;patients will visit the good doctor--it&#39;s too crowded!&lt;br&gt;But soon Doctor Dolittle&#39;s fame as an animal doctor spreads far and wide--all the way to Africa, where a village of sick monkeys needs Doctor Dolittle&#39;s help!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the Publisher&#39;s request, this title is being sold without Digital Rights Management Software (DRM) applied.&lt;/p&gt;" />
