  <title>Dracula: With a New Introduction - Bram Stoker, Tina Rath</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;An eBook edition of Bram Stoker&#39;s classic novel&lt;em&gt; Dracula&lt;/em&gt; with a new extended introduction on vampire myths and legends by leading vampire expert Dr Tina Rath. The introduction explores the development of Vampire myths and legends from early sixteenth-century stories to the current teenage vampire obsession evinced by &lt;em&gt;Buffy the Vampire Slayer&lt;/em&gt; and the &lt;em&gt;Twilight&lt;/em&gt; series of books and films.&lt;br /&gt;From Arnold Paul, an allegedly real vampire of the sixteenth-century, to Lord Byron&#39;s physician Dr John Polidori who created the vampire Lord Ruthven, to Camilla, Brunhilda and Varney, who all made their contributions to our picture of the vampire, the picture was completed by &lt;em&gt;Dracula&lt;/em&gt; when it was published in 1897. Tina Rath explores our impressions of vampires throughout the ages in books, on stage and on screen, as well discussing the origins of Bram Stoker&#39;s Dracula.&lt;br /&gt;Dracula is probably the best-known, least-read horror novel in the English (or possibly any other) language. Say &#39;Dracula&#39; and we all know what we mean: the handsome Master Vampire with sleek dark hair forming a widow&#39;s peak on his forehead, a black cloak, possibly lined with red silk, over faultless evening dress, fangs and photophobia. What we will almost certainly not visualise is Stoker&#39;s vision of Dracula. Tina explains why.&lt;/p&gt;" />
