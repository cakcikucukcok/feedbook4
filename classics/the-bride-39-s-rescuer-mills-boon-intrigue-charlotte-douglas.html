          &lt;strong&gt;IN SAVING CELIA&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Unconscious and wearing a torn wedding dress, Celia Stevens washed up on the shores of Solitaire and threw Cameron Alexander&#39;s peaceful seclusion into complete chaos. Not only did her presence force him to reexamine his reasons for hiding out, but within days the walls around Cameron&#39;s hardened heart slowly began to crumble….&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;Celia sensed her enigmatic captor had a dangerous past, one she&#39;d be better off not learning. And yet, it was Cameron&#39;s tough exterior as well as his tortured soul that made Celia long to spend a lifetime wrapped in his arms. But just as a future together looked possible, the evil that Cameron had feared for six years reared its ugly head, threatening the dreams they had dared to dream….&lt;/p&gt;
