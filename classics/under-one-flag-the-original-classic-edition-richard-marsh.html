&lt;p&gt;
Look inside the book: &lt;p&gt;&#39;I&#39;m not fond of spying, and I&#39;m not fond of them as is, but as he don&#39;t seem to be using you well, if I do find out who he&#39;s playing it off with--though, mind you, I don&#39;t see how I&#39;m going to--still, as I say, if I should happen to find out, why, I&#39;ll tell you, straight!&#39;
...When you said last night that you&#39;d give me five pounds for my name and address I saw that you were fool enough for anything, so I gave you the first that came, and that happened to be a friend of mine&#39;s, and I&#39;m in her place now, waiting for her to come back with my young man, so that&#39;s how you&#39;ve chanced to find me here.&#39;
...But on the morning of the twenty-fourth--Tuesday--I had had a letter--a most cheerful letter--in which Popham informed me that since one of his children had the measles, and another the mumps, and his wife was not well, and his own constitution was slightly unbalanced owing to a little trouble he had had with his motor--he had nearly broken his neck, from what I could gather--it had occurred to him that Christmas under his roof might not be such a festive season as he had hoped, and so he gave me warning.   
&lt;p&gt;About Richard Marsh, the Author:&lt;P&gt; A story about a mysterious oriental figure who pursues a British politician to London, where he wreaks havoc with his powers of hypnosis and shape-shifting, Marsh&#39;s novel is of a piece with other sensational turn of the 19th to 20th century fictions such as Stoker&#39;s Dracula, George du Maurier&#39;s Trilby, and Sax Rohmer&#39;s Fu Manchu novels.   Like Dracula and many of the sensation novels pioneered by Wilkie Collins and others in the 1860s, The Beetle is narrated from the perspectives of multiple characters, a technique used in many late 19th-century novels (those of Wilkie Collins and Stoker, for example) to create suspense and to confuse gender boundaries." />
