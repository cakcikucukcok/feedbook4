  <title>The Mcclintock Proposal (Mills &amp; Boon Intrigue) - Carol Ericson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="
        &lt;p&gt;The moment Rod McClintock spots the disheveled bride on the side of the road, he knows life is about to become a lot more complicated. Callie Price is on the run and in need of his protection. She&#39;s also the answer to his financial woes, if they&#39;re both willing to say &quot;I do.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;A marriage of convenience is Callie&#39;s sole shot at inheriting the ranch that&#39;ll help her rebuild her life. All she needs is a husband in name only. Her smoldering cowboy rescuer fits the role perfectly. Too perfectly. As they struggle to escape a killer&#39;s obsession, peril and passion tie them together. And before long, someone is putting &quot;till death do us part&quot; to the ultimate test….&lt;/p&gt;
