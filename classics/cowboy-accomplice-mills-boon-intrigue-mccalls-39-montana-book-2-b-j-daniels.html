        &lt;p&gt;HOW HARD COULD IT BE TO FIND A COWBOY IN MONTANA…?&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;All J.T. McCall cared about were cattle. He&#39;d always been the responsible brother and had taken over the day-to-day management of the family-owned Sundown Ranch years ago. He was as authentic as a cowboy can come–and Regina Holland knew it.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;He was just what she was looking for, and she was determined to have him–for business purposes only, of course. So when she finagled a job with his cattle drive deep in the Montana mountains, she didn&#39;t count on becoming a killer&#39;s target or on falling for J.T. But would they survive the assault of a madman?&lt;/p&gt;
