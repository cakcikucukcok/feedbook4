Published In 1865, Alice&#39;s Adventures in Wonderland became an instant success, and author Lewis Carroll broke ground with his unique take on children‘s stories: Instead of the overly simplistic and sometimes dry tales that characterized the genre in the Victorian age, Carroll introduced a book that didn‘t look down on its audience, and one that – to this day – is enjoyed by children and adults alike. Alice&#39;s Adventures in Wonderland has been translated into 176 languages, and adapted to the screen close to 20 times, most notably by Tim Burton in the 2010 feature film that saw Mia Wasikowska as Alice and Helena Bonham Carter as the unforgettable Queen of Hearts." />
