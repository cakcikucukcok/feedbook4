  <title>Mark Twain&#39;s Adventures of Tom Sawyer and Huckleberry Finn: The NewSouth Edition - Alan Gribben</title>
      <meta name="description" content="In a radical departure from standard editions, Twain&#39;s most famous novels are published here as the continuous narrative that the author originally envisioned. More controversial will be the decision by the editor, noted Mark Twain scholar Alan Gribben, to eliminate the pejorative racial labels that Twain employed in his effort to write realistically about social attitudes of the 1840s. Gribben points out that dozens of other editions currently make available the inflammatory words, but their presence has gradually diminished the potential audience for two of Twain&#39;s masterpieces. The novels can be enjoyed deeply and authentically without the continual encounters with hundreds of now-indefensible words, Gribben explains." />
