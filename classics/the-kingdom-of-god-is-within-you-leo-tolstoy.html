  <title>The Kingdom of God Is Within You - Leo Tolstoy</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The Kingdom of God Is Within You is a non-fiction book written by Leo Tolstoy.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
A philosophical treatise, the book was first published in Germany in 1894 after being banned in his home country of Russia. It is the culmination of thirty years of Tolstoy&amp;#39;s thinking, and lays out a new organization for society based on a literal Christian interpretation. The Kingdom of God is Within You is a key text for Tolstoyan, nonviolent resistance, and Christian anarchist movements. Mohandas Gandhi wrote in his autobiography The Story of My Experiments with Truth (Part II, Chapter 15) that this book &amp;quot;overwhelmed&amp;quot; him and &amp;quot;left an abiding impression.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Gandhi listed Tolstoy&amp;#39;s book, as well as John Ruskin&amp;#39;s Unto This Last and the poet Shrimad Rajchandra (Raychandbhai), as the three most important modern influences in his life. Reading this book opened up the mind of the world-famous Tolstoy to Gandhi, who was still a young protester living in South Africa at the time.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
In 1908 Tolstoy wrote, and Gandhi read, A Letter to a Hindu, which outlines the notion that only by using love as a weapon through passive resistance could the native Indian people overthrow the colonial British Empire. This idea ultimately came to fruition through Gandhi&amp;#39;s organization of nationwide nonviolent strikes and protests during the years 1918&amp;ndash;1947. In 1909, Gandhi wrote to Tolstoy seeking advice and permission to republish A Letter to a Hindu in his native language, Gujarati. Tolstoy responded and the two continued a correspondence until Tolstoy&amp;#39;s death a year later in 1910. The letters concern practical and theological applications of nonviolence, as well as Gandhi&amp;#39;s wishes for Tolstoy&amp;#39;s health. Tolstoy&amp;#39;s last letter to Gandhi &amp;quot;was one of the last, if not the last, writings from his pen.&amp;quot;" />
