  <title>What Is to Be Done? - Nikolai Chernyshevsky, Michael R. Katz</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&quot;No work in modern literature, with the possible exception of &lt;em&gt;Uncle Tom&#39;s Cabin&lt;/em&gt;, can compete with &lt;em&gt;What Is to Be Done?&lt;/em&gt; in its effect on human lives and its power to make history. For Chernyshevsky&#39;s novel, far more than Marx&#39;s &lt;em&gt;Capital&lt;/em&gt;, supplied the emotional dynamic that eventually went to make the Russian Revolution.&quot;—Joseph Frank, &lt;em&gt;The Southern Review&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Almost from the moment of its publication in 1863, Nikolai Chernyshevsky&#39;s novel, &lt;em&gt;What Is to Be Done?&lt;/em&gt;, had a profound impact on the course of Russian literature and politics. The idealized image it offered of dedicated and self-sacrificing intellectuals transforming society by means of scientific knowledge served as a model of inspiration for Russia&#39;s revolutionary intelligentsia. On the one hand, the novel&#39;s condemnation of moderate reform helped to bring about the irrevocable break between radical intellectuals and liberal reformers; on the other, Chernyshevsky&#39;s socialist vision polarized conservatives&#39; opposition to institutional reform. Lenin himself called Chernyshevsky &quot;the greatest and most talented representative of socialism before Marx&quot;; and the controversy surrounding &lt;em&gt;What Is to Be Done?&lt;/em&gt; exacerbated the conflicts that eventually led to the Russian Revolution.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Michael R. Katz&#39;s readable and compelling translation is now the definitive unabridged English-language version, brilliantly capturing the extraordinary qualities of the original. William G. Wagner has provided full annotations to Chernyshevsky&#39;s allusions and references and to the, sources of his ideas, and has appended a critical bibliography. An introduction by Katz and Wagner places the novel in the context of nineteenth-century Russian social, political, and intellectual history and literature, and explores its importance for several generations of Russian radicals.&lt;/p&gt;" />
