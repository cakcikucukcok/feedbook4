  <title>The Honour Killing - J.S. Hamilton</title>
      <meta name="description" content="When a teenage Sri Lankan au pair goes missing, it’s up to the Bradford police to find her. When they fail, the objective turns to justice. For DCI James Turnbull, the case is a puzzling contrast to his career in the Murder Squad – this time, he needs to prove that a crime has even been committed. 
With no body and no motive, Turnbull and his team closely look at the family who hosted the seventeen-year-old Fathima, among other suspects. As circumstantial evidence piles up, Turnbull looks to convert his investigation into a conviction – but at what cost? 
In this novel by James Stewart, the guilty party is the justice system itself. This case will remind everyone involved, from the police to legal representatives that sometimes we can’t account for the human element. The system is not without limits, nor is it infallible. With the outcome resting on a knife’s edge, can justice ever truly be served for the missing?" />
