  <title>The Iron Heel -  Jack London</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The Iron Heel is a dystopian novel by American writer Jack London, first published in 1908.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Generally considered to be &amp;quot;the earliest of the modern Dystopian&amp;quot;, it chronicles the rise of an oligarchic tyranny in the United States. It is arguably the novel in which Jack London&amp;#39;s socialist views are most explicitly on display.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
A forerunner of soft science fiction novels and stories of the 1960s and 1970s, the book stresses future changes in society and politics while paying much less attention to technological changes. The book is unusual among London&amp;#39;s writings in being a first-person narrative of a woman protagonist written by a man. Much of the narrative is set in the San Francisco Bay Area, including events in San Francisco and Sonoma County.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The Socialist revolution that The Iron Heel focused on never does occur, a defeat of the modern oligarchy will come as most other things have seemed to occur, as a gradual waning towards something better." />
