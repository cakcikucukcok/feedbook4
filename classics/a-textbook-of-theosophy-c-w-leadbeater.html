  <title>A Textbook of Theosophy - C.W. Leadbeater</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Theosophy is an ecumenical faith tradition that regards all religions as striving toward the same shared purpose of engendering love, cooperation, unity, and fellow-feeling among all of the world&amp;#39;s cultures. A Textbook of Theosophy offers a comprehensive introduction to theosophical thought and practice; it&amp;#39;s perfect for beginners just getting acquainted with this school of thought or long-time adherents seeking new insights.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
C.W. Leadbeater (16 February 1854 &amp;ndash; 1 March 1934) was a member of the Theosophical Society, author on occult subjects and co-initiator with J. I. Wedgwood of the Liberal Catholic Church.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Originally a priest of the Church of England, his interest in spiritualism caused him to end his affiliation with Anglicanism in favour of the Theosophical Society, where he became an associate of Annie Besant. He became a high-ranking officer of the society, but resigned in 1906 amid a sex scandal. Accusations of his detractors were never proven, and after Annie Besant became President of the Society, he was readmitted in 1908. Leadbeater went on to write over 69 books and pamphlets as well as maintain regular speaking engagements. His efforts on behalf of the society assured his status as one of its leading members until his death in 1934." />
