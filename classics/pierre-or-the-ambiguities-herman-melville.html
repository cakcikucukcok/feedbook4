  <title>Pierre, Or, The Ambiguities - Herman Melville</title>

Experimental and without reservations, &quot;Pierre&quot; will remain a glowing oddity of American literature." />

One long brain-muddling, soulbewildering ambiguity (to borrow Mr. Melville's style), like Melchisedeck without beginning or end - a labyrinth without a clue - an Irish bog without so much as a Jack o' th'-lantern to guide the wanderer's footsteps - the dream of a distempered stomach, disordered by a hasty supper on half-cooked pork chops".<br /><b><i>Pierre: or, The Ambiguities (Penguin Classics): Melville ...</i></b> | Pierre; or, The Ambiguities tells the story of Pierre Glendinning Jr., the 19-year-old heir of the manor at Saddle Meadows in New York.
