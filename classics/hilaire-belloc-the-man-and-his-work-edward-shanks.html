  <title>Hilaire Belloc, the Man and  His Work - Edward Shanks</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Edward Richard Buxton Shanks (11 June 1892 &amp;ndash; 4 May 1953) was an English writer, known as a war poet of World War I, then as an academic and journalist, and literary critic and biographer. He also wrote some science fiction.&lt;br /&gt;
He was born in London, and educated at Merchant Taylors&amp;#39; School and Trinity College, Cambridge. He passed his B.A. in History in 1913. He was editor of Granta from 1912&amp;ndash;13. He served in World War I with the British Army in France, but was invalided out in 1915, and did administrative work until war&amp;#39;s end.&lt;br /&gt;
He was later a literary reviewer, working for the London Mercury (1919&amp;ndash;22) and for a short while a lecturer at the University of Liverpool (1926). He was the chief leader-writer for the Evening Standard from 1928 to 1935.&lt;br /&gt;
The People of the Ruins (1920) was a science-fiction novel in which a man wakes after being put into suspended animation in 1924, to discover a devastated Britain 150 years in the future.[1] The People of the Ruins has an anti-communist subtext (the future 1924 is devastated by Marxist revolutionaries)." />
