  <title>The Exalter - Matthew McHenry</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;i&gt;The Exalter&lt;/i&gt; was pleased to be at the top pillar looking down at a game where he had arranged all the pieces.&lt;p&gt;
&lt;i&gt;The Exalter&lt;/i&gt; says he is god. The Knowers continue to follow him blindly and question nothing. The Exalter promises to end all violence and solve economic turmoil in this futuristic setting. Those unwilling to accept the Exalter are forced slaves to these so-called believers working for mandatory minimal wages, and small governmental food rations. These unfortunate men, women, and children are globally known as Derogates. Derogates are separated from normal society in poverty stricken villages.&lt;p&gt;
In this uncertain future, Nicolai struggles with the battles in his personal life. As his work becomes meaningless his own wife begins to slip away from him. He cant seem to find real purpose.&lt;p&gt;
Droughts, strange earthly phenomenons, famines, and the release of countless prisoners during the Great Pardon cause him and others to question the Exalters rule. Where are these promises of peace?&lt;p&gt;
When the unanswered disappearances of Derogates are discovered mass speculation and chaos follow. Nicolai finds himself searching for answers about his wife, his government, and even the Exalter himself. &lt;p&gt;
Events unfold and Nicolai never imagined he would be fleeing for his very life. Stresses build and armies begin to turn on their leaders as a new war looms on the horizon. This war is for individual survival. &lt;p&gt;
&lt;i&gt;The Exalter&lt;/i&gt; looked confident like that of a strong lion surrounded by starved and weakened animals. My ways are easy to follow without guilt or heavy expectations.&lt;p&gt;
How will all of this end and how many will live or die?" />
