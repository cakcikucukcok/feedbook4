  <title>A Dove in the Distant Oaks - Doris Newman</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;A Dove in the Distant Oaks is like a camera zooming in from a distance until it focuses on one little girl, Diana wandering around the farm as a child. We see some of the varied life of a farmers family until Diana marries a minister and their lives take them far from the farm. The family now consisting of Danny, Dianna, Ben and Britta leave the well know routine of the farm for the exciting life of the parsonage. Another child would soon come along and Dianas nest would be full. Danny was living the life of a Pastor, staying in a place for a period of time before moving on to the next assignment. Their journeys would take them from Miller, SD, then to Britton, SD before moving on to their assignment in the small town of Medart, Fl. Little did they know that their next move would take them to the far north country of International Falls, MN. Following that move they would Pastor in Marshall, MN, New York Mills, MN, Bridgeport, IL, and Granite City, IL, before life would take them back to where she started in the old farming community of Arlington, SD. Would she find contentment. You be the judge. Read the book and find out.&lt;/p&gt;" />
