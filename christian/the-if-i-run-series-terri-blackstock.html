  <title>The If I Run Series - Terri Blackstock</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Three complete novels from&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;USA TODAY&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;bestselling author Terri Blackstock are now available in a low-priced, one-volume e-collection!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;If I Run&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;em&gt;USA TODAY&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;bestseller!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Casey knows the truth. But it won&amp;rsquo;t set her free.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Casey Cox&amp;rsquo;s DNA is all over the crime scene. There&amp;rsquo;s no use talking to police; they&amp;rsquo;ve failed her abysmally before. She has to flee before she&amp;rsquo;s arrested . . . or worse. The truth doesn&amp;rsquo;t matter anymore.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But what&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;is&amp;nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;the truth&lt;em&gt;?&amp;nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;That&amp;rsquo;s the question haunting Dylan Roberts, the war-weary veteran hired to find Casey. PTSD has marked him damaged goods, but bringing Casey back can redeem him. Though the crime scene seems to tell the whole story, details of the murder aren&amp;rsquo;t adding up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Casey Cox doesn&amp;rsquo;t fit the profile of a killer. But are Dylan&amp;rsquo;s skewed perceptions keeping him from being objective? If she isn&amp;rsquo;t guilty, why did she run?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unraveling her past and the evidence that condemns her will take more time than he has, but as Dylan&amp;rsquo;s damaged soul intersects with hers, he is faced with two choices: the girl who occupies his every thought is a psychopathic killer . . . or a selfless hero. And the truth could be the most deadly weapon yet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If I&#39;m Found&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this riveting sequel to the&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;USA TODAY&amp;nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;bestseller&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;If I Run&lt;/em&gt;, evil lurks, drawing Casey out of the shadows . . . but there is light shining in the darkness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Casey Cox is still on the run, fleeing prosecution for a murder she didn&amp;rsquo;t commit. Dylan Roberts&amp;mdash;her most relentless pursuer&amp;mdash;is still on her trail, but his secret emails insist he knows the truth and wants to help her. He&amp;rsquo;s let her escape before when he had her in his grasp, but trust doesn&amp;rsquo;t come easily.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As Casey works to collect evidence about the real murderers, she stumbles on another unbearable injustice: an abused child and a suicidal man who&amp;rsquo;s also been falsely accused. Casey risks her own safety to right this wrong and protect the little girl from her tormenters. But doing so is risky and may result in her capture&amp;mdash;and if she&amp;rsquo;s captured, she has no doubt she&amp;rsquo;ll be murdered before she ever steps foot in a jail cell.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;If I Live&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The hunt is almost over.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Casey Cox is still on the run after being indicted for murder. The hunt that began with her bloody footprints escalates, and she&amp;rsquo;s running out of places to hide. Her face is all over the news, and her disguises are no longer enough. It&amp;rsquo;s only a matter of time before someone recognizes her.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dylan Roberts, the investigator who once hunted her, is now her only hope. Terrifying attempts on Dylan&amp;rsquo;s life could force Casey out of hiding. The clock is ticking on both their lives, but exposing the real killers is more complicated than they knew. Amassing the evidence to convict their enemies draws Dylan and Casey together, but their relationship has consequences. Will one life have to be sacrificed to protect the other?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;If I Live,&amp;nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;Terri Blackstock takes us on one more heart-stopping chase in the sensational conclusion to the If I Run series.&lt;/p&gt;" />
