  <title>Love Letter to the Editor - Robin Lee Hatcher</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s 1885 and five preachers sit around a campfire out West, trading stories of unlikely couples they&#39;ve seen God bring together. This is one of those stories . . .&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;She&#39;s the best writer the paper has ever had. He&#39;s her new editor. And she doesn&#39;t like it one bit.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Molly Everton is the outspoken daughter of the town&#39;s newspaper publisher. She had the best education her father&#39;s money could buy and she&#39;s a better writer than he is. So when her father passes her over for the position of editor and gives the job to an outsider from back East, she&#39;s furious. But a smart girl like Molly knows she can drive the new guy out of town with little trouble if she plays her cards right . . .&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jack Ludlow came out West for adventure and wide open spaces, not romance. And he&#39;s not intimidated by the beautiful daughter of his new employer. At first he&#39;s just trying to prove to her he is the right man for the job&amp;mdash;but before long he&#39;s set on stealing her heart.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Robin&amp;rsquo;s stories are always an adventure of the heart! She is one of the premier storytellers of our day.&quot;&amp;nbsp;&amp;mdash;Karen Kingsbury, best-selling author&lt;/p&gt;" />
