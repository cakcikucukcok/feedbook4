      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Nuala Anne McGrail is almost more than any poor mortal man can handle without losing his sanity: her beauty causes shortness of breath in men of all ages, she&#39;s strong, she&#39;s smart, she&#39;s witty, she sings like an angel, and--to top it all off--she&#39;s psychic, or fey as they say in the Old Country.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But our man Dermot Michael Coyne, &quot;accidental millionaire,&quot; part-time writer, and full-time worshiper of Nuala, seems to be bearing up pretty well in as much as Herself has consented to marry him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before that blissful day arrives, another one of Nuala&#39;s &quot;spells&quot; sends the pair on a hunt to find out what really happened to Al Capone&#39;s famous rival, Jimmy &quot;Sweet Rolls&quot; Sullivan. And as they&#39;ve found in previous adventures, historic mysteries can often be too current for safety, and the dead should be left buried--wherever they are.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the Publisher&#39;s request, this title is being sold without Digital Rights Management Software (DRM) applied.&lt;/p&gt;" />
