  <title>The Aloha Reef Collection - Colleen Coble</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Set on the breathtaking Hawaiian island of Kauai, the Aloha Reef Collection provides an intoxicating mix of romance and suspense with the rhythms of island life from &lt;em&gt;USA Today&lt;/em&gt; bestselling author COLLEEN COBLE&amp;mdash;now available in one volume!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Distant Echoes&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It seems like paradise, but dark secrets lurk just below the surface.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When a tragic accident downs a tourist boat off the coast of Hawaii, dolphin researcher Kaia Oana is one of the first in the water, risking her own life to try and save others. She&amp;rsquo;s enlisted to help the US Navy find out what really happened&amp;mdash;utilizing her specially trained dolphins to help.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kaia and Lieutenant Commander Jesse Matthews team up in the investigation&amp;mdash;but as they edge closer to the truth about the incident, their own lives are threatened. Will a spirit of grace and forgiveness prevail or will it be overshadowed by the distant echoes of past pain and the imminent danger from a cold-blooded killer?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Black Sands&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a volcano on Hawaii begins to rumble, family crisis brings an unlikely couple together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Annie&#39;s the brainy type, quietly assisting her father in his volcano research. She&#39;s always admired her brother&#39;s friend Mano for his outgoing athletic ways, but her devotion turns to disdain after Mano&#39;s mistake results in her older brother&#39;s untimely death.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mano&#39;s mistake haunts him. It cost his best friend&#39;s life. But just as he&#39;s bringing Tomi&#39;s belongings to his family, Mano discovers Tomi is alive&amp;mdash;and in serious danger. That danger threatens to spill over to the rest of the family.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Annie and Mano join forces to discover the source of the threat against the family, even as a long-inactive volcano rumbles in the distance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dangerous Depths&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes life&#39;s most precious treasure lies at Dangerous Depths.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Leia ditched a promising medical career to settle on a secluded island in Hawaii. Her ex-fianc&amp;eacute; Bane has come to the island to find out why.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When an act of sabotage pushes Bane closer to Leia, they are plunged into a tangle of emotion and peril&amp;mdash;just as a series of threatening natural events grip the island.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Midnight Sea&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Losing her sight turns Lani&amp;rsquo;s world upside down, bringing danger, mystery . . . and unexpected romance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A seemingly random shooting at her aunt&#39;s coffee farm has left Lani Tagama blind. Now she must learn to navigate in a world of darkness. With the help of an ex-cop named Ben and a half-trained guide dog, Lani begins to regain her former independence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then Lani and Ben discover that her injury wasn&amp;rsquo;t caused by a random shooting. It was a botched murder attempt. They must work together to discover the identity of the would-be murderer before he strikes again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Holy Night&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One sinister phone call has derailed their wedding. Will they let it tear them apart forever?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Christmas wedding on the beach&amp;mdash;what could be more perfect? Poinsettias and fragrant pikake blossoms, soft sand and mistletoe, the gentle sound of the surf and the wedding march played on a ukulele. This wedding has been a long time coming&amp;mdash;with Bane&#39;s trust issues and Leia&#39;s worries about her childlike sister, Eva. Now they can hardly wait for the day to arrive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thrilled to be a bridesmaid, Eva keeps trying on her ruffled dress. The tent is reserved, the caterers are paid. Everything is going as planned&amp;mdash;until Leia&#39;s phone rings and her world skids out of control. A muffled voice informs Leia that Eva&#39;s been kidnapped and will be killed unless Leia calls off the wedding without explanation&amp;mdash;and no police! If she disobeys instructions and tells Bane, she&#39;ll risk her beloved sister&#39;s life. But how can she ever handle this without his help? And how can he ever trust her if she lies to him now?&lt;/p&gt;" />
