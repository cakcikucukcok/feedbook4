  <title>Irresistible You - Francis Ray</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Pierce Grayson is a marked man: if his mother, Ruth, has her way, his carefree single days will soon be over. But Pierce isn&#39;t going down without a fight. He&#39;s ready to take action against his mama&#39;s matchmaking...but what he&#39;s completely unprepared for is the feeling that hits him when he meets Broadway actress Sabra Raineau. She&#39;s in Santa Fe helping Ruth with a production at the University. With her luscious lips and long legs, Sabra is temptation personified--and Pierce isn&#39;t in the habit of resisting temptation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;With Hollywood calling and another play in the works, Sabra has no time for romance. And, after one heartbreak too many, she&#39;s happy to stay unattached. But Pierce has other ideas--the kind that can curl a girl&#39;s toes. Sabra&#39;s not above a little extracurricular activity, but she can&#39;t afford to risk her heart on anything serious. Still, the closer she gets to Pierce, the harder it is to deny him--and to keep a secret that could tear them apart....&lt;/p&gt;" />
