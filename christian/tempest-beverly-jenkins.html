      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;From &lt;/em&gt;USA Today&lt;em&gt; Bestselling Author Beverly Jenkins comes a new novel in a mesmerizing series set in the Old West, where an arranged marriage becomes a grand passion . . .&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What kind of mail-order bride greets her intended with a bullet instead of a kiss? One like Regan Carmichael&amp;#8212;an independent spirit equally at home in denims and dresses. Shooting Dr. Colton Lee in the shoulder is an honest error, but soon Regan wonders if her entire plan to marry a man she&amp;#8217;s never met is a mistake. Colton, who buried his heart along with his first wife, insists he only wants someone to care for his daughter. Yet Regan is drawn to the unmistakable desire in his gaze.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Regan&amp;#8217;s far from the docile bride Colton was expecting. Still, few women would brave the wilds of Wyoming Territory for an uncertain future with a widower and his child. The thought of having a bold, forthright woman like Regan in his life&amp;#8212;and in his arms&amp;#8212;begins to inspire a new dream. And despite his family&amp;#8217;s disapproval and an unseen enemy, he&amp;#8217;ll risk all to make this match a real union of body and soul.&lt;/p&gt;" />
