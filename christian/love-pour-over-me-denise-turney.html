  <title>Love Pour Over Me - Denise Turney</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&amp;#39;Love Pour Over Me&amp;#39; is a powerfully moving, inspirational story. This remarkable, inspirational story recounts African American track and field star, Raymond Clarke&amp;#39;s tumultuous, yet amazingly triumphant life.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Malcolm, Raymond&amp;#39;s father, struggles with untreated alcoholism. Raymond&amp;#39;s mother, a starry-eyed dreamer, abandoned Raymond when he was only two years old. Raymond&amp;#39;s track and field successes make him one of America&amp;#39;s top middle-distance runners, earning him a scholarship to a prestigious university.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But, it&amp;#39;s at college, where Raymond&amp;#39;s life is supposed to take off, that things really start to get dicey, frighteningly mysterious. Right away, Raymond meets a motley sort of friends, each with a hard-to-believe story of his own. The men enter a lifelong bond. They also make a pact to keep their involvement in a murder secret.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Raymond becomes witness to the murder upon his arrival to college. His desperate attempts to avoid love threaten to keep him from the only woman he&amp;#39;s ever truly loved, the woman he was born to love. Anyone who has ever been hurt may absolutely treasure &amp;#39;Love Pour Over Me&amp;#39;." />
