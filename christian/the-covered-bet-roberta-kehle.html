  <title>The Covered Bet - Roberta Kehle</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;    After her husband trashes their marriage, Seattle air-charter pilot Diana Gunn needs courage. While tthey attempt to reconstruct their lives, they also support a teenage grandson abandoned by both his mom and their gambling-addicted son who, at thirty-nine, still has a death-grip on the family. Diana is desperate for her splintered family to be made whole again.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;    The son, trying to compensate for a lifetime of being a lousy dad, wins a car in a blackjack game, and gives it to grandson Kaleb, destroying Diana&amp;#8217;s efforts as well as introducing him to the glamor of gambling and the killing world of organized crime. The Syndicate needs the family to disappear and puts out a hit on them all. A friend is murdered, and Diana&amp;#8217;s plane is ripped by bullets fired from a fishing boat.&lt;/p&gt;  After their son and grandson disappear, Diana and her husband enlist the help of a friend, a Fijian Seattle police officer with unique abilities who travels across time and space.&amp;#160; In the ghostly, rat-infested caverns beneath Seattle&amp;#8217;s streets, the father and son, trapped together, discover treacherous secrets. Will they die before being able to reveal them? Diana prepares to give her life for her sons, but will that be enough to heal and reclaim her family?&lt;/div&gt;" />
