  <title>The Arms of God - Lynne Hinton</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Alice is making her daughter dinner when her mother Olivia, who left her at a day care center when she was four-years-old, appears at her door. Although Alice has managed to navigate an unforgiving foster care system to build a good life for herself, she has never really recovered from her mother&#39;s disappearance. Olivia&#39;s sudden reappearance is like a quiet, unexplained gift. Over the next couple of weeks Alice asks Olivia to dinner. Olivia is always dropped off by a friend and sits peacefully as Alice and her daughter talk over the meal. One afternoon Alice gets a call from the hospital telling her that Olivia is dead. The only identification the hospital could find was Alice&#39;s number with the word &quot;daughter&quot; written underneath it. She goes to pick up Olivia&#39;s things and finds the key to her apartment. It is here that the mystery of Olivia&#39;s past is slowly uncovered and Alice begins to understand how the power of hatred can hold a woman down and how the power of friendship can lift her up again. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not since her bestselling book &lt;i&gt;The Friendship Cake&lt;/i&gt; has Hinton created characters who are so filled with heartache and fragile hope, that they will become a permanent part of the reader&#39;s life.&lt;/p&gt;" />
