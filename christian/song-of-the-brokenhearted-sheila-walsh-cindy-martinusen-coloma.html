  <title>Song of the Brokenhearted - Sheila Walsh, Cindy Martinusen Coloma</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;&lt;B&gt;Ava has a loving&amp;nbsp;family, a beautiful house, and a solid faith. &lt;/B&gt;&lt;B&gt;Suddenly, her ideal life will be completely broken . . . in the best of ways.&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/P&gt; &lt;P&gt;Ava’s life is full of great things. Her daughter is getting married to just the right guy, her husband’s company has kept them financially successful for years, her son is thriving as&amp;nbsp;a high-school&amp;nbsp;football player, and&amp;nbsp;the ministry she started is keeping her busy as she reaches out to those with “broken hearts.”&lt;/P&gt; &lt;P&gt;Then it all falls apart. Ava’s safe world becomes unanchored, and she is forced to face the childhood she’s run away from her entire life. Just as she’s trying to sift through the pieces, the doorbell rings and Ava is confronted with the surprise of her life.&lt;/P&gt; &lt;P&gt;Ava must set out on a journey that takes her back home. Along the way, she encounters God in&amp;nbsp;new and unexpected ways. She sees she&#39;s been hiding her brokenness behind good deeds and the comforts of a safe life. Learning what it means to lose it all is just the start of Ava’s journey—as is the new song God is writing on her heart.&lt;/P&gt;" />
