  <title>Dark Pursuit - Brandilyn Collins</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Ever hear the dead knocking?&amp;rdquo; Novelist Darell Brooke lived for his title as King of Suspense&amp;mdash;until an auto accident left him unable to concentrate. Two years later, reclusive and bitter, he wants one thing: to plot a new novel and regain his reputation. Kaitlan Sering, his twenty-two-year-old granddaughter, once lived for drugs. After she stole from Darell, he cut her off. Now she&amp;rsquo;s rebuilding her life. But in Kaitlan&amp;rsquo;s town two women have been murdered, and she is about to discover a third. She&amp;rsquo;s even more shocked to realize the culprit is her boyfriend, Craig, the police chief&amp;rsquo;s son. Desperate, Kaitlan flees to her estranged grandfather. For over forty years, Darell Brooke has lived suspense. Surely he&amp;rsquo;ll devise a plan to trap the cunning Craig. But can Darell&amp;rsquo;s muddled mind do it? And&amp;mdash;if he tries&amp;mdash;with what motivation? For Kaitlan&amp;rsquo;s plight may be the stunning answer to the elusive plot he seeks . . .&lt;/p&gt;" />
