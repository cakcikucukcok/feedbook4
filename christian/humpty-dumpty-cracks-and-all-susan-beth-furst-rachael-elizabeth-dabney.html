  <title>Humpty Dumpty Cracks and All - Susan Beth Furst, Rachael Elizabeth Dabney</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Humpty Dumpty was more than just a cracked egg in need of a quick fix, as the classic nursery rhyme would have us believe. Humpty had become complacent after sitting on his wall for so many years. As he lay cracked and broken on the ground, all he could do was wait and hope. When a wandering knight and a drummer boy offered little in the way of help, Humpty began to despair. A fortunate series of events ensued, and Humpty found himself miraculously transformed. There is a bit of Humpty in all of us, and it is never too late for a miracle. So hold on to your hope, and dont look back. And as Humpty so brilliantly observed, It is a good day for a new adventure!&lt;/p&gt;" />
