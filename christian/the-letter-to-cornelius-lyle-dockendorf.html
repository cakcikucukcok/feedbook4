  <title>The Letter to Cornelius - Lyle Dockendorf</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;In modern Israel a miraculously preserved parchment is discovered which dates back to the First Century C.E. But the message it bears is even more surprising, for it repudiates one of the most fundamental of Christian tenets. How will that impact the various churches if its true?&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Two people are intimately drawn into the controversy. Father Mark Colfax, a noted theologian, has abandoned his former academic career to seek a closer relationship with God by serving the most helpless. But his churchs concern about that message will eventually force him to investigate both what history and the Bible actually says about the contested dogma. Ultimately, it will challenge him to question his own beliefs.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Sara Tannenden is a young journalist, appalled by the hypocrisy rampant in her profession. Although apathetic about religion, she is assigned to report on the impact of the parchment on different church denominations. The investigation will lead her to an increase in faith, but also pull her into a dangerous confrontation with evil.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;The Letter to Cornelius is about searching for truthand what that search might cost.&lt;/p&gt;" />
