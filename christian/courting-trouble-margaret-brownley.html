  <title>Courting Trouble - Margaret Brownley</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s 1885 and five preachers sit around a campfire out West, trading stories of unlikely couples they&#39;ve seen God bring together. This is one of those stories . . .&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;He&#39;s a wild-West attorney and she&#39;s his beautiful client. Could she really be guilty of murder?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Attorney Brock Daniels meets Grace Davenport in the least romantic setting he could imagine: the town jail. And yet her beauty and kindness capture his heart almost from the start.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But Grace is facing a tough &quot;jury&quot; in this rough-and-tumble town. And the charges don&#39;t look good given her track record. This last one makes her a widow three times over, with each of her dead husbands worse than the last. Geoffrey ate poisoned mushrooms, Harry was so drunk he got thrown by a horse, and Billy Joe went missing after Grace chased him down and gave him what for at the saloon where he&#39;d gambled away all their food money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, Brock is a skilled attorney. And Grace&#39;s son Jesse is determined to prove her innocence through researching case law at Brock&#39;s side until his mom is freed. In the end, Brock may be meeting Grace in front of a judge for an altogether more celebratory occasion . . . as soon as she&#39;s cleared.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;A delightfully romantic tale.&quot; &amp;mdash;Maggie Brendan, author of &lt;em&gt;The Jewel of His Heart&lt;/em&gt; (on &quot;And Then Came Spring&quot; in &lt;em&gt;A Bride for All Seasons&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
