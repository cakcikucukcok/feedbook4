  <title>Soul Tracker - Bill Myers</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;What if you could visit heaven and hell, traveling when and wherever you wish . . . without ever dying? What if your teenage daughter, the joy of your life, had died a tragic death and you discovered a way to visit her? What if there were people and beings, on both sides of the grave, who want to stop your return? These are the questions facing novelist David Kauffman. As a single parent he is devastated when his young daughter meets an untimely death. Desperate to contact her, he meets Gita Patekar, a beautiful and committed Christian with a scarred and shame-ridden past. She works for &amp;ldquo;Life After Life&amp;rdquo;&amp;mdash;an organization dedicated to tracking and recording the experiences of the soul once it leaves the body. Despite Gita&amp;rsquo;s warnings that God is opposed to contacting the dead, David uses the organization&amp;rsquo;s computer to try to find his daughter. In the process they discover Gita&amp;rsquo;s organization has some very deep and dark secrets. A suspense-filled game of cat and mouse begins&amp;mdash;both on earth and beyond the grave&amp;mdash;as the couple work together, fall in love, and struggle to expose the truth . . . until they come face to face with the ultimate Love and Truth.&lt;/p&gt;" />
