  <title>Out of the Blue - Pat Miller</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Josie Bouchard lives in Prince Edward Island and learned to fly when she was sixteen. Four years later, World War II broke out, and she enters the war as a nurse in London.&lt;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a serious illness, Josie decides to use her experience as a pilot and joins the Air Transfer Auxiliary. The ATA ferries planes from the factories to the air bases. Josie breaks the rules when she takes the famous Spitfire through barnstorming maneuvers she learned from a close family friend, Sean Campbell.&lt;p&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Josies daredevil stunts land her in hot water. Her ATA flying comes to a stop when the military grounds her and sends her to work in the hangar as a mechanic. When several ferry planes crash, sabotage is suspected, and Josies name is rumored as the saboteur.&lt;p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Sean Campbell, the friend Josie had always regarded as another brother, has worked his way into Josies heart. Now that she realizes she loves him, the family gets word that he is missing in action in Germany.&lt;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Josie has her whole life planned out, but the war changes everything. Her friends tell her that God has a plan for her. As each plan goes awry, she becomes aware of incidents that seem to come out of the blue. Are they accidents, coincidences, or miracles of God?&lt;/p&gt;" />
