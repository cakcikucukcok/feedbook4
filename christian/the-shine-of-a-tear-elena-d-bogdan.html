&lt;p&gt;Stella is young, idealistic, and ambitious. With a prayer in her heart and a strong determination to help her family, Stella embarks on an adventure that will take her away from her family and comfort and transplant her into a new and strange environment. Her fears are great. Will she come through for her family? Will she be able to succeed with this new undertaking? Worried and anxious, she chooses to put her faith and trust in Gods protection and care. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Colin is rich, handsome, and dark. He is stern, cold, and distant as he lives with a secret buried in his heart, making it hard for anyone but his daughter to bring a smile to his face. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the two lives collide, will Stella be able to help Colin overcome his past and, together, find happiness?&lt;/p&gt;" />
