        &lt;p&gt;WHAT A WESTMORELAND WANTS&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;He&#39;s been biding his time, and now the perfect opportunity has arrived for Callum Austell to pursue the ultimate object of his affections. Offering Gemma a job to decorate his new home means she has to come to him. And on his territory, the Aussie knows he can easily woo her into his bed. But this Westmoreland woman is no pushover. If Callum is to get what he wants–as always–the millionaire just might have to utter those three little words first.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;A WIFE FOR A WESTMORELAND&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;A Night to Remember… &lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;For weeks, Derringer Westmoreland is haunted by memories of a woman whose face he cannot recall. But he wants and needs to share their intense passion again. When he finally tracks down his mystery woman, he is blown away by surprise. Lucia Conyers is his sister-in-law&#39;s best friend and his fantastic one-night stand! And she refuses to become one of Derringer&#39;s women. For the first time in his charmed life, the rancher has some persuading to do. And if he wants to win Lucia&#39;s heart, he must be ready to risk his own….&lt;/p&gt;
