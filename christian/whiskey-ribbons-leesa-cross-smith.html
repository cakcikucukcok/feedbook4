  <title>Whiskey &amp; Ribbons - Leesa Cross-Smith</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Set in contemporary Louisville, Leesa Cross-Smith&amp;rsquo;s mesmerizing first novel surrounding the death of a police officer is a requiem for marriage, friendship and family, from an author Roxane Gay has called &amp;ldquo;a consummate storyteller.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Evi&amp;mdash;a classically-trained ballerina&amp;mdash;was nine months pregnant when her husband Eamon was killed in the line of duty on a steamy morning in July. Now, it is winter, and Eamon&#39;s adopted brother Dalton has moved in to help her raise six-month-old Noah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Whiskey &amp;amp; Ribbons&lt;/em&gt; is told in three intertwining, melodic voices: Evi in present day, as she&amp;rsquo;s snowed in with Dalton during a freak blizzard; Eamon before his murder, as he prepares for impending fatherhood and grapples with the danger of his profession; and Dalton, as he struggles to make sense of his life next to Eamon&amp;rsquo;s, and as he decides to track down the biological father he&amp;rsquo;s never known.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the vein of Jojo Moyes&amp;rsquo; After You, Whiskey &amp;amp; Ribbons explores the life that continues beyond loss, with a complicated brotherly dynamic reminiscent of Elizabeth Strout&amp;rsquo;s The Burgess Boys. It&amp;rsquo;s a meditation on grief, hope, motherhood, brotherhood and surrogate fatherhood. Above all, it&amp;rsquo;s a novel about what it means&amp;mdash;and whether it&amp;rsquo;s possible&amp;mdash;to heal.&lt;/p&gt;" />
