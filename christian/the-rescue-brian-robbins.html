  <title>The Rescue - Brian Robbins</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Sarah Martinez has always felt different. She cant explain what is missing, but she knows this cant be all there is. She dreams of living on her own in an apartment in downtown Portland, but deep down she fears that even moving out of her parents house in the suburbs wont satisfy the longing in her soul. Then she discovers something unexpected in her great-grandmothers attic, and a new dream begins to grow within her.&lt;br&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Living in a time when the United States is a churchless, closed nation under military rule, Sarah has never thought much about the existence of God. But soon after her discovery she is being pursued by gangs of men who seem possessed by a supernatural power. Then she meets Justin, a mysterious stranger who claims that judgment is coming and he can protect her, but at the cost of all that she has known. Soon Sarah is swept up in an adventure that will test her new-found faith and change her life forever. Does she really believe? Will she really leave everything behind?&lt;/p&gt;" />
