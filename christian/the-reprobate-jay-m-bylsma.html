      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;When Jason Richards receives a prestigious fellowship that requires him to evaluate nursing home administration from the perspective of a resident, he chooses a Christian nursing home established by his own denomination. As he gets to know his subject, Howard Runner, Jason finds him far from a typical nursing home resident. Runner is accused by his fellow residents, and even the nursing home&amp;rsquo;s staff, of being a reprobate, as his theological views appear to be contrary to some of the doctrines of Christianity.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Is he an agnostic?
