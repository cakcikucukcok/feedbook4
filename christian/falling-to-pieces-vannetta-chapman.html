  <title>Falling to Pieces - Vannetta Chapman</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;In this first book of a three-book series, author Vannetta Chapman brings a fresh twist to the popular Amish fiction genre. She blends the familiar components consumers love in Amish books&amp;mdash;faith, community, simplicity, family&amp;mdash;with an innovative who-done-it plot that keeps readers guessing right up to the last stitch in the quilt. When two women&amp;mdash;one Amish, one English&amp;mdash;each with different motives, join forces to organize a successful on-line quilt auction, neither expects nor wants a friendship. As different as night and day, Deborah and Callie are uneasy partners who simply want to make the best of a temporary situation. But a murder, a surprising prime suspect, a stubborn detective, and the town&#39;s reaction throw the two women together, and they form an unlikely alliance to solve a mystery and catch a killer. Set in the well-known Amish community of Shipshewana, Falling to Pieces will attract both devoted fans of the rapidly-growing Amish fiction genre, as well as those who are captivated by the Amish way of life.&lt;/p&gt;" />
