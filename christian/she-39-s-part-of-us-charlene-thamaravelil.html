  <title>She&#39;s Part of Us - Charlene Thamaravelil</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Shes Part of Us is a work of fiction. David V. Abraham is the main character. He is a singer, just like in the movie Beaches.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Abrahams heart has a journey to take. Staying In the field of medicine would be the proper thing to do; however, his new found love of music brought to him the world of bright lights and glamor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To marry or not to marry an American girl is his biggest dilemma. He didnt plan it that way, but while working alongside Misty he fell in love with her. But getting married to her would mean defying his family elders, which he had no intention of doing. Misty is the nurse who takes care of Elizabeth, a little girl with celiac disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Abraham makes his decision while standing over Elizabeth and singing to her with all his might. He is singing one of Bobby Goldsboros songs. Though the blending of two other people gave her birth; we will love her with all our hearts &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mark is Mistys friend with whom she grew up, and he is in the air force. They are engaged; however, he gets shipped out to Vietnam and leaves without saying good bye.&lt;/p&gt;" />
