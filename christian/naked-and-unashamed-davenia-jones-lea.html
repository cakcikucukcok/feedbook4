  <title>Naked and Unashamed - Davenia Jones Lea</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;After two years, Shula still cant believe her husband, Seth, is gone. In an effort to live again and to feel again, she accepts an offer to counsel women about marriage, love and fulfillment at Namaans, a Christian spa and retreat center designed to meet the spiritual, emotional, mental, and physical needs of women. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It all begins with Shulas first week-long retreat, Naked and Unashamed, where she leads four women on a journey, exploring the ins and outs of the big S. &lt;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Barbaras husband just retired and has finally joined her at home. Shes dreamed of this moment but so far nothings changed. Barb reasons there must be passion after sixty, and shes hoping shell discover ways to spice things up in more ways than adding cayenne pepper to her chicken tetrazzini. &lt;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lindsey hopes to boost her confidence as her wedding draws near. Shes done it rightvirgin til I doyet the man she loves took an alternate route. How will Lindsey measure up to Gabriela, the mother of her fiancs son, and how on earth will she fare as a stepmother and new wife? &lt;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then theres Savannah, who believes she has the perfect marriage. So why did her husband, Reed, suggest she attend this retreat? Savannahs hoping some new moves in the kitchen and bedroom will solve her problems. But Shulas hoping she can help Savannah uncover the root of her struggles and do what it takes to penetrate the wall that guards her heart. &lt;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And finally theres Alex. Shes already determined divorce is the answer. She makes six figures, six figures more than her husband, and runs her home single handedly. Shes convinced she really has no need for a husband and wonders why she married him in the first place. This week is her last-ditch effort to salvage her marriage, or at least give the illusion that she gave it her all before giving the loafer the boot. &lt;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These four very different women united by Shulas unusual therapeutic tactics as well as the amazing staff, services and food at Naamans, make unexpected discoveries about marriage, love, and more importantly, themselves. Surprising truths are revealed, past wounds are healed, and precious relationships are made, all while learning to live freefree of guilt, pain, fear, sorrow, shame, and the lies of the enemyfree to live naked and unashamed. &lt;p&gt;" />
