  <title>Beyond Far - Robert Martin</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;After a brutal beating by her husband, who vowed she could never go far enough that he wouldnt find her, Erin Anderson escapes in fear for her life. She moves to another state but is discovered there by her husband and leaves, only to be discovered again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Befriended by the investigator her husband hired to find her, Erin resists a romantic relationship she knows would not be right. She is burdened with guilt over having abandoned her eight-year-old stepdaughter and longs for an opportunity to return and be the mother the child needs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Life as a fugitive is harder than she ever imagined. Where can she hide, and how much help should she accept from the investigator who befriended her? Answers dont come easily. Will she learn through these challenges to trust not in herself but in the faithfulness of God?&lt;/p&gt;" />
