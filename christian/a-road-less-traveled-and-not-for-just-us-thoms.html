      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;For much of my life, I believed the lack of detailed information about the early years of the life of Jesus of Nazareth was a major cover-up. I believed its suppressed because it did not fit the story being sold. Over the years, I have come to believe in a more refined truth. It does not exist because its retention was not important at the time he lived.&lt;br&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;By the end of his ministry of about three years, what passed on in oral traditionshepherds who became kingshad their stories told and written down. Seen are the results of the work of carpenters and masons, but their lives were not. How a man grew from being a child to boy to man was not as important as the results of his life. We were told a descendent of Abraham met God at a burning bush; we know little of how he got there.&lt;br&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Victors write history. Victors do not include what does not support what they wish were known. To purposefully exclude first requires that there is something known.&lt;br&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;I wrote a book that has my answers to my questions I have asked over the years. I tell people that I could be like Clark Kent but never a Superman. I am from Earth, not Krypton. Similarly, I can be like Jesus of Nazareth, but could never be a Christ.&lt;br&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;I hope I will cause you to think about life and love.&lt;br&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Both are precious to me, and I hope you have an abundance of both.&lt;br&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Sincerely,&lt;br&gt;
