  <title>Southern Storm - Terri Blackstock</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;First a dead stranger. Now a missing police chief. Did Chief Cade run off to elope? Or has he met with foul play?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;No one knows who the victim was, where he came from, or why he staggered out in front of Chief Cade&amp;rsquo;s car. Guilt overwhelms him that he killed the mysterious stranger, until Cade learns that the man had been shot at close-range before he was struck. Determining his identity and finding the shooter becomes Cade&amp;rsquo;s top priority.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But then Cade vanishes off of the island of Cape Refuge. Rumors spread like wildfire that Cade was involved with the dead man&amp;rsquo;s wife and that the death was not accidental. Did Cade run to escape murder charges, or has something sinister happened to him?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Blair Owens knows Cade wouldn&amp;rsquo;t have done the things they&amp;rsquo;re saying &amp;hellip; and he wouldn&amp;rsquo;t have left without saying goodbye. She&amp;rsquo;s determined to find him herself, but her search takes her to some dangerous places. Finding Cade will take faith in a God whom Blair has always doubted. Will He listen to her prayers when she&amp;rsquo;s given Him nothing but grief? Cade&amp;rsquo;s life might hang in the balance . . . &amp;nbsp;and time is running out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;em&gt;New York Times &lt;/em&gt;bestselling suspense author Terri Blackstock, &lt;em&gt;Southern Storm &lt;/em&gt;is the second book in her riveting Cape Refuge series.&lt;/p&gt;" />
