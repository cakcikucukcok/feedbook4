  <title>A Man For Honor (Mills &amp; Boon Love Inspired) (The Amish Matchmaker, Book 6) - Emma Miller</title>
      <meta name="description" content="
        &lt;p&gt;Second-Chance Match&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;With four children and a dilapidated farmhouse, Amish widow Honor King asks Seven Poplars’ matchmaker to find her a secure and reliable new husband. Someone the opposite of her first love—who left her at the altar nine years ago—and yet someone she’s never been able to forget. Luke&#39;s back in town and also looking for a new partner. But for him, there&#39;s only one candidate for his wife—the woman he let get away. But when Honor won&#39;t let him into her life, he works his way into her house. Hammer in hand, he&#39;ll fix her home…but it&#39;ll take more than brawn and nails to mend her heart.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;The Amish Matchmaker: Bringing love to Seven Poplars–one couple at a time.&lt;/p&gt;
