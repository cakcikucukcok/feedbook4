  <title>Sunrise on the Battery - Beth Webb Hart</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;&lt;B&gt;She wanted her husband to attend the town’s society-driven church. God answered her prayer in a radical way.&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/P&gt; &lt;P&gt;An emptiness dogs Mary Lynn Scoville. But it shouldn’t.&lt;/P&gt; &lt;P&gt;After all, she’s achieved what few believed possible. Born in the rural south, she has reached the pinnacle of worldly success in Charleston, South Carolina. Married to a handsome real estate developer and mother to three accomplished daughters, Mary Lynn is one Debutante Society invitation away from truly having it all.&lt;/P&gt; &lt;P&gt;And yet, it remains—an emptiness that no shopping trip, European vacation, or social calendar can fill.&lt;/P&gt; &lt;P&gt;When a surprise encounter leads her to newfound faith, Mary Lynn longs to share it with her husband. But Jackson wrote God off long ago.&lt;/P&gt; &lt;P&gt;Mary Lynn prays for him on Christmas Eve . . . and her husband undergoes a life-altering Damascus Road experience. As Jackson begins to take the implications of the Gospel literally, Mary Lynn feels increasingly isolated from her husband . . . and betrayed by God. She only wanted Jackson beside her at church on Sunday mornings, not some Jesus freak who evangelizes prostitutes and invites the homeless to tea.&lt;/P&gt; &lt;P&gt;While her husband commits social suicide and the life they worked so hard for crumbles around them, Mary Lynn wonders if their marriage can survive. Or if perhaps there really is a more abundant life that Jackson has discovered, richer than any she’s ever dreamed of.&lt;/P&gt;" />
