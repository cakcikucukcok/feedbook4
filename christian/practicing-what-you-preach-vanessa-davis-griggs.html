  <title>Practicing What You Preach - Vanessa Davis Griggs</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The wedding between Angela Gabriel and Brent Underwood promises to be the Birmingham event of the year--and aspiring event planner Melissa Anderson has been working feverishly to make it happen. During this hectic time, she even agrees to go out on a date with a most unlikely prospect: Marcus Peeples. When it came to Marcus, it definitely wasn&#39;t love at first sight. But after a lovely evening together of Bible study at Followers of Jesus Faith Worship Center, Melissa has a change of heart. She learns not only is Marcus a successful investor, but he&#39;s also a gifted minister. There&#39;s just one hitch: He&#39;s divorced--a fact Melissa can&#39;t reconcile with scripture even though she knows he&#39;s a good man and father. But when Marcus&#39;s diva ex-wife decides she wants him back, Melissa soon discovers love, divorce, and faith have quite a bit in common.  .  .   &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Praise for Vanessa Davis Griggs and her novels.  .  .&lt;/b&gt;  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  &quot;This inspirational novel leaves the reader eager to know what Griggs plans next for this spiritual family.&quot; --&lt;i&gt;Publishers Weekly&lt;/i&gt; on &lt;i&gt;Blessed Trinity&lt;/i&gt;" />
