  <title>Life Is, as It&#39;s Been Given - Richard Ramone</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Life was going well for Jason Porter, a man whose position on the world stage was as comfortable to him as a second skin. His company, Twenty-Second Century Medicine was competing to become the global authority on medical care. Life could not have been any better; however, unknown to Jason that was all about to change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jason will soon be shown a rare glimpse into a world hiding in plain sight and will find himself in the crosshairs of a demonic power whose only objective is to end his life. A mighty angel is sent to protect him from this evil slaughter and from himself. Because he turned his back on God and freely walked away, Jason has opened himself to the demonic power and has unknowingly given them the right to his life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What Jason does not know is that if he fails to turn and give his life back to God, the angel who was sent to save his life will have to take it.&lt;/p&gt;" />
