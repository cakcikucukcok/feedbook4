  <title>Until the Miracles Come - Paul Paprocki</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Tragedy struck Celeste House at the age of nine when both of her parents were killed in a car accident. Over the next twenty years, life threw her one hard punch after another. Determined to have a better life, each time she was knocked down, she stood up and reentered the ring. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although she was working three jobs, she teetered on the brink of bankruptcy. Celeste and her seven-year-old son, Henry, lived in a rundown apartment in a bad neighborhood. This prompted her to pray every day for God to help her provide for her son. Henry also prayed every day for his mother to be happy. None of their prayers, however, had been answered. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While eating a TV dinner for her Thanksgiving meal, Celeste reached her breaking point. Defeated, she realized that only a miracle could turn things around. Frustrated, she went to her church and asked God why he had not been honoring her requests. This time God spoke to her, but it was not the answer she had expected.&lt;/p&gt;" />
