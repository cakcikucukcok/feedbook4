  <title>BBW Romance - J.l. Ryan</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;b&gt;Pick your pleasure! Do you crave steamy billionaire romance, bad boy romance, or angsty romance? Can&amp;#39;t get enough of second chance romance, BBW romance, or sexy boss romance? You don&amp;#39;t have to choose. It&amp;#39;s all here! From bestselling author J.L Ryan, comes this hot and sexy read with a heat level of 10!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;i&gt;The last person in the world she wants to be with is the one person she can&amp;#39;t live without...&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Reluctant billionaire Alexander Jacobs was not prepared for the events that would forever change his life. His parents were killed by a drunk driver, he had no siblings, or close friends.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
While he enjoyed the fruits of his family&amp;#39;s business, he was much too young, at only 23, to run their corporate conglomerate. He was dreading the upcoming funeral for his parents, but when he saw that his longtime friend, curvy girl Brienne Warhol was there, it made him feel just a little better.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
She was attending Columbia Law School, but when she heard about Alexander&amp;#39;s parents, she knew she had to be with him. He went to college locally and missed Brienne&amp;#39;s friendship when she left for New York. She fantasized about him constantly, but he thought of her only as &amp;quot;one of the guys.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
When she finally graduated from law school, they met up for a celebratory glass or two of champagne. She had too much to drink, and before she could stop herself, she kissed him. Deeply. Her head was spinning, and after he looked at her like she had crossed the line, she felt sick.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
She wished she could take back that damn kiss. Did plus size Brienne ruin her chances of a romantic relationship with Alexander, the only man she&amp;#39;s ever wanted in her life, or did her &amp;quot;move&amp;quot; spark something inside him that he&amp;#39;d never felt before?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;If you crave steamy billionaire romance books like 50 Shades Of Grey, bad boy romance, BBW romance, angsty romance, plus size romance, or second chance romance books, don&amp;#39;t miss out on this sexy bad boy billionaire obsession read!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
