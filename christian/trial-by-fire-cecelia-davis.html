  <title>Trial by Fire - Cecelia Davis</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;In&amp;nbsp; the&amp;nbsp; sequel,&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt; Trial by Fire&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, additional missions from heaven are offered as Johnny and Jeremy grow up and have families of their own. Will they be accepted and completed?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In one episode, Jeremy has become an investigator for nursing homes in the state of Kansas. He and his family go to Colorado to visit with Johnny and his family. Carl Benson is also visiting. Jeremy thinks this is a perfect time to ask the retired undercover police officer for a favor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He wants Carl to go undercover to a particular nursing home that is under investigation. An argument erupts and Carl walks out. After praying about it, Carl agrees to go undercover as Jeremy&amp;rsquo;s father-in-law. This is all a part of Heaven&amp;rsquo;s Mission for Carl and Jeremy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, after Carl has a stroke and his arm is broken due to negligence, Jeremy doesn&amp;rsquo;t want Carl to go back to the nursing home. Carl has been told that if he does not go back, their part in Heaven&amp;rsquo;s Mission will have failed. Jeremy has previously made the statement that people fail the Lord all the time, but to see Heaven&amp;rsquo;s Mission fail in your own life is almost more than one can bear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After thinking about it, Jeremy has to make a decision. Does he take Carl back and risk further injury to him or does he play it safe and keep him where he can care for him?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Johnny&amp;rsquo;s young daughter, Jenny turns on the tv to watch cartoons. An announcement comes on about a fire engulfing a nursing home brings Johnny and his wife into the living room instead.&amp;nbsp; When the name of the nursing home comes into view, Johnny calls his brother.&amp;nbsp; Moments later, Johnny and his family watch in horror as Jeremy goes into the burning building but doesn&amp;rsquo;t come out before the building collapses.&amp;nbsp; He soon realizes he will need to go and make arrangements for his brother&amp;rsquo;s body.&lt;/p&gt;" />
