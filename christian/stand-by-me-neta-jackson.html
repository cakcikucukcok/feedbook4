  <title>Stand by Me - Neta Jackson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sometimes the person you most need is the one least like you.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Kathryn Davies is a bright young woman from a prominent Phoenix family. But after making a leap of faith at a Christian music fest, dropping out of med school, and moving to inner city Chicago, her family all but disowns her.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;When Kat discovers SouledOut Community Church, she longs to become a part of the multicultural church family. But her tendency to immediately say whatever she&amp;AElig;s thinking steps on the toes of nearly everyone she meets&amp;ugrave;especially Avis Douglass.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Avis has a strong faith, is the principal of one of Chicago&amp;AElig;s highest performing elementary schools, and is a founding member of SouledOut. But the country&amp;AElig;s economic downturn has thrown both her and her husband&amp;AElig;s jobs in question. And Avis hasn&amp;AElig;t heard from her youngest daughter in months&amp;ugrave;an estrangement that gnaws at her every day. Where is God in this?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Kat&amp;AElig;s flamboyant zeal for living a &amp;ocirc;radical&amp;ouml; Christian life is a stark contrast to Avis&amp;AElig;s more reserved faith. But in God&amp;AElig;s timing, the two women discover they need each other in ways neither of them expected.&lt;/p&gt;" />
