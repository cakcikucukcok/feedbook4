  <title>The Banks Sisters 2 - Nikki Turner</title>
      <meta name="description" content="New   York Times bestselling author Nikki Turner returns with the next edition in   the highly successful Banks Sisters trilogy.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Meet the Banks sisters&amp;mdash;Simone, Bunny, Tallhya, and Ginger. They feel like   they are finally in the clear in connection with the recent bank   robberies&amp;mdash;until their mother shows up demanding her share at gunpoint. She   threatens to snitch them out if they don&amp;rsquo;t come correct. The situation   becomes a bloody mess, and now, two sisters must band together to cover up   the unthinkable actions of one of their own. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As if that isn&amp;rsquo;t enough, Pastor Cassius Street hits them with another major   blow. He refuses to sign over the deed to their Me-Ma&amp;rsquo;s home, as they had   hoped. Luckily, Ginger has more than enough tricks to provide the pastor with   a dilemma of his own.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As the hunt for the bank robbers continues, Simone worries about being   caught by the man she loves. He&amp;rsquo;s the head detective on the case, and with   the recent dead bodies washing up at the riverbank around town, he&amp;rsquo;s closer   than he thinks to solving the case. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Bunny is dealing with the loss of her everything, Spoe. She vows to get her   revenge by any means necessary on everyone who played a role in his untimely   demise. Will she be able to convince her sisters to have her back once   again?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Tallhya is still hurting because of her husband&amp;rsquo;s betrayal, and she feels   like she&amp;rsquo;s close to losing her mind. Can any of her sisters pull her out of   her downward spiral, or will they completely shut her out?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;How will these sisters deal with their own mountain of problems, get back   the only home they know, and get their lives back on track? Only time will   tell . . . as long as they stay one step ahead of the circumstances they   unwittingly create.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Banks Sisters 2 will make your head spin with all its dramatic twists,   turns, and deadly surprises." />
