  <title>An Amish Family Christmas - Shelley Shepard Gray</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;In Shelley Shepard Gray&amp;#8217;s fourth book in her Charmed Amish Life series, an unlikely Amish romance reveals that Christmas is a time for family, miracles&amp;#8212;and love.&amp;nbsp; &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ever since his father died in a tragic fire, Levi Kinsinger has felt adrift. Newly returned to Charm, Ohio, Levi is trying to fit into his old life, only to discover he seems to have outgrown it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But when Julia, his young widowed neighbor, asks for his help with a Christmas project, Levi finds a sense of purpose for the first time in months. She and her daughter are new to Charm and could use a friend, a job Levi takes personally. Soon enough, friendship grows into attraction, but Levi can&amp;#8217;t help having doubts. There&amp;#8217;s something about Julia that doesn&amp;#8217;t ring quite true&amp;#8230;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Like Levi, Julia Kemps has survived her fair share of hardships&amp;#8212;but only by hiding the truth of her past. Being an unmarried mother in an Amish community was unthinkable. Feeling hopeless, Julia did the only thing she could do: she moved to a new town and pretended to be a widow. But meeting Levi, she&amp;#8217;s hopeful for the first time. Little by little, she begins to imagine telling him her darkest secret, and eventually&amp;#8230;perhaps even sharing her life with him. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Christmas is a time for family, and as the holiday draws closer, Julia and Levi will have to face their pasts together&amp;#8230;in order to find the healing, support and love they so desperately desire. &lt;/p&gt;" />
