  <title>Into the Tempest - Eric Luppold</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;What if it were illegal for parents to share their faith with their children? Would you still do it? What if it meant risking custody of your children?&lt;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the future United States created by Eric Luppold in his book, Into the Tempest, it is illegal for anyone to expose minors to religious teaching due to it being a violation of their rights and freedoms. Adults who are religious are viewed as having a psychological disorder requiring treatment. It is in this world where we follow the lives of two very different individuals. The first is Sam, a high school student who struggles with the same things other boys his age struggle with: bullies, girls, and homework. Yet Sams world is quickly turned upside down when he is introduced to the Christian faith, causing him to question the secular society around him. While Sam struggles to find his own identity in a world that hates Christians, Detective OConnor fights to protect minors from religions effects. The sudden loss of his wife years earlier led Detective OConnor to conclude two things: God does not exist, and he hates God. Yet, as events in his life bring him into contact with Sam, Detective OConnor is forced to confront his dark past and his personal war against God.&lt;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Into the Tempest is an intriguing and thought-provoking novel. As you read, you may find yourself wondering, Could this really happen here?&lt;/p&gt;" />
