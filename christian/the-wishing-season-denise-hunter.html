  <title>The Wishing Season - Denise Hunter</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In this competition, it&amp;rsquo;s not just the house on the line, it&amp;rsquo;s their hearts.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She has the touch when it comes to food, but PJ McKinley&amp;rsquo;s dream of opening her own restaurant is one building short of reality. So when a Chapel Springs resident offers her beloved ancestral home as prize to the applicant with the best plan for the house, PJ believes she was meant to win.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Contractor Cole Evans is confident, professional, and swoon-worthy&amp;mdash;but this former foster kid knows his life could have turned out very differently. When Cole discovers the contest, he believes his home for foster kids in transition has found its saving grace. All he has to do is convince the owner that a not-for-profit enterprise will be good for the community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the eccentric philanthropist weighs the proposals, she proposes an outlandish tie-breaker: PJ and Cole will share the house for a year to see which idea works best. Now, with Cole and the foster kids upstairs and PJ and the restaurant below, day-to-day life has turned into an out-and-out rivalry&amp;mdash;with some seriously flirtatious hallway encounters on the side. But could their magnetic attraction cost them everything they&amp;rsquo;ve ever wanted?&lt;/p&gt;
