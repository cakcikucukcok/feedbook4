  <title>SINKA: THE CHRONICLES OF A COLOSSUS - Francess Kay</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;SYNOPSIS - Sinka, The Chronicles of a Colossus&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The adventure within, sad imagery in exposure, hunted to a hunter, the African society and culture indifference. The Chronicles of a Colossus, an elusive story of a conqueror from slavery in the dungeons of abuse to a queen in a palace liberating recent day victims trapped in the same situation she witnessed. This book is a realistic fiction, and is written from past life experience of the author &lt;strong&gt;&amp;lsquo;FRANCESS KAY&amp;rsquo;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sinka, The Chronicles of a Colossus&lt;/strong&gt; timelines the adventures of Sinka, a young Sierra Leonean girl who has had it all shades of rough existence from losing her parents at a very tender age, to being shepherded to her uncle&amp;rsquo;s house whom care was entrusted in, later turned out where she had her first and worst taste of abuses from not only her uncle, but his sons. From there, it was like a free gateway for the hungry beast and its offspring to devour; inhumanity at its peak, she was harassed, then demoted to an object of sexual satisfaction. With no one to solicit on her behalf, she was left to nurse the pain within. The starting phase of her life journey was as a slave in the dungeons where she endured all manner of pains and abuse- physical, sexual, financial and emotional; (unfortunate events a young girl of her age would not live to tell the tale) However would she find true happiness?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Chronicles of a Colossus&lt;/strong&gt;, time passed while the sad experiences live on as she grew into a promising young lady. Life seemed to turn rosy for her when she met her sweetheart, Musa in her college days who adored her more than anything in the world&amp;hellip; a sweet romance blossomed. Life was not done with her yet, good things don&amp;rsquo;t come that easy. She had several challenges and milestones she must overcome. To be precise, a blast from her past resurfaces that is so shameful and scorn, but the love she shared with her beau was out of this world as he dared to be with her no matter whatever the outcome, even to the cost of his life; a true taste of true love. From grass to grace, she rose from the dungeons of slavery to a palace of her own&amp;hellip; from the ashes of an all-time brand of sorrow, decides to fight child-sexual abuse to a standstill.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This book &lt;strong&gt;&amp;lsquo;Sinka, the Chronicles of a Colossus&amp;rsquo;&lt;/strong&gt; has several aims which are meant to be channelled into the society. Typical examples are highlighting the ills and fallouts of child sexual abuse, several ways of evading it, as well as its many branches and tributaries, with a view to discourage it in its entirety. It is hoped that the aim will be comprehensively achieved and serve as a call-to-action for all and sundry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;" />
