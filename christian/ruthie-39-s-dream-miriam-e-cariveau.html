  <title>Ruthie&#39;s Dream - Miriam E. Cariveau</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Through the eyes of a cheerful nine-year-old girl, we see a bit of life along the dusty roads of Judea. Imagine Ruthie watching other children who are walking, running, jumping, and chasing each other. She could not join them. But she knew that her physical limitations would never limit her expressions of hope and joy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Always expect a miracle, even from a dreamfrom your very own dream, her mother had often said. Ruthie knew that Gods love was real, and her hope was in trusting Him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of her special delights was caring for their donkey, Samuel. Even to this old creature, her kindness and compassion radiated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ruthies story of what happened one day on the way to Jerusalem is intended to touch the heart.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; A vividly colorful story with many lovely layers depicting Gods love and grace, [Ruthies Dream] truly shows the faith of a child and the blessings that follow. It is as pure and delightful as its author.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lisa Binzoni, owner of The English Rose Tea Room and Gifts in Pleasanton, California &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a father and grandfather, Im pleased to endorse Miriams story about a little girl whose faith in Jesus is rewarded in a miraculous way. As a pastor, Im always looking for ways to make the story of Jesus personal. Miriam has done that with Ruthies dream. &lt;/p&gt;
