  <title>Though None Go with Me - Jerry B. Jenkins</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Though None Go with Me is a unique heart-warming love story of an unforgettable woman and her determination to make her life an experiment in obedience to God. Elisabeth Grace Leroy, born at the turn of the century, wants something more. Then one night as a young teen she finds what her heart has been yearning for. The defining moment in her life comes when she stands and promises to deepen her commitment and follow Christ, no matter the cost. So begins a remarkable journey of resolve, winding through valleys of loss and deserts of testing toward a legacy of faith. Two world wars, the Great Depression, and devastating personal loss form the backdrop for a lifetime of walking with God despite all odds. Though None Go with Me is a powerful novel depicting one courageous woman&#39;s determination to stand faithful in all circumstances. It is a moving saga of forgiveness and peace amidst the loves, trials, and joys of an American family. And ultimately, it is a portrait of the far-reaching impact of a life that fully embraces the steadfast promises of God." />
