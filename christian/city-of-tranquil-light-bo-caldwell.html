  <title>City of Tranquil Light - Bo Caldwell</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&quot;What ardent, dazzling souls emerge from these American missionaries in China . . . A beautiful, searing book that leaves an indelible presence in the mind.&quot; --Patricia Hampl, author of &lt;i&gt;The Florist&#39;s Daughter &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Will Kiehn is seemingly destined for life as a humble farmer in the Midwest when, having felt a call from God, he travels to the vast North China Plain in the early twentieth-century. There he is surprised by love and weds a strong and determined fellow missionary, Katherine. They soon find themselves witnesses to the crumbling of a more than two-thousand-year-old dynasty that plunges the country into decades of civil war. As the couple works to improve the lives of the people of Kuang P&#39;ing Ch&#39;eng-- City of Tranquil Light, a place they come to love--and face incredible hardship, will their faith and relationship be enough to sustain them? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Told through Will and Katherine&#39;s alternating viewpoints--and inspired by the lives of the author&#39;s maternal grandparents--&lt;i&gt;City of Tranquil Light&lt;/i&gt; is a tender and elegiac portrait of a young marriage set against the backdrop of the shifting face of a beautiful but torn nation. A deeply spiritual book, it shows how those who work to teach others often have the most to learn, and is further evidence that Bo Caldwell writes &quot;vividly and with great historical perspective&quot; (&lt;i&gt;San Jose Mercury News&lt;/i&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;" />
