  <title>A Pleasing Temptation (Mills &amp; Boon Kimani) (The Boudreaux Family, Book 8) - Deborah Fletcher Mello</title>
      <meta name="description" content="
        &lt;p&gt;Can he open her heart to more than a fleeting passion?&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;An ambitious daughter of a close-knit Louisiana clan, Kamaya Boudreaux is making a name for herself in the business world, pursuing lucrative opportunities across the country. But when her best-kept-secret venture—an exclusive male strip club—is threatened to be exposed, the all-work-no-play entrepreneur needs to do some serious damage control. Her plans don’t include giving in to temptation with sexy Southerner Wesley Walters, whose buff six-pack body was made for pleasure.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;As franchise owner of the high-end New Orleans nightclub, Wes is on the climb to corporate success. He hates deceiving Kamaya—she has no idea that her lover was once the most popular performer at his establishment and guests are willing to pay top dollar for his return. With their passionate affair leading them into forever territory, Wes has to come clean. Or he risks losing the guarded beauty whose own intimate secrets could also jeopardize their future together…&lt;/p&gt;
