      <meta name="description" content="Chenai was frustrated by her husband Jamess unselective infidelity. One day she came home from work unexpected only to find her husband in her bed with her maid. A fight ensued, which necessitated her companions to call for help. As various people tried to counsel the estranged couple, unpalatable truths were revealed while James implored for help and promised to turn over a new leaf. Tambudzai, Jamess mother, however had different ideas. She had chosen a suitable wife for him who had gone into his household under disguise as maid whose dismissal sewed prickly barbs of unpalatable discontent, estrangement, and unimaginable horrors in the family. A spiritual warfare ensued in which Tambudzai relentlessly used black magic against Chenai whose sole ammunition are her prayers and spiritual faith. Who eventually won this tug of war? Several unexpected discoveries thwart Chenais resolutions. Surely what goes round comes around!" />
