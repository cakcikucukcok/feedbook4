  <title>A Perfect Match - Kathleen Fuller</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Naomi King has a perfect track record when it comes to matchmaking&amp;mdash;not only has she successfully matched her two best friends with their husbands, she also introduced her sister Priscilla to her fianc&amp;eacute;. Now with her sister&amp;rsquo;s wedding right around the corner, Naomi wonders why she&amp;rsquo;s able to find husbands for her friends and family, but not one for herself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At age twenty-nine, Zeke Lapp is a confirmed bachelor. The problem is, he doesn&amp;rsquo;t want to be. But despite his family and friends&amp;rsquo; attempts at matching him up with the single women in his community of Middlefield, he still hasn&amp;rsquo;t found the one for him. He wonders if he ever will. Zeke arrives in Paradise to help his cousin finish the house he&amp;rsquo;s building for his soon-to-be new wife. A month before the wedding, he meets the bride&amp;rsquo;s sister, Naomi, a pretty girl with a bubbly personality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the moment they meet, Zeke is attracted to Naomi. But Naomi tries to set him up with her friend Margaret, who is desperate for a mate. Hiding her unexpected feelings for Zeke, she is reluctant but loyal to her friend. When the date is a disaster, Naomi comforts her friend but cannot deny her growing feelings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Zeke and Naomi grow closer, so does their reliance on God&amp;rsquo;s will for their future and in a moment of honesty, both reveal what&amp;rsquo;s holding them back. Will they be able to overcome these obstacles and find true love?&lt;/p&gt;" />
