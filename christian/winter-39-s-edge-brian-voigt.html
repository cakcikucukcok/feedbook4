      <meta name="description" content="Bill Simmons is a man in the western tradition who, after losing his first wife to death, has an opportunity to start over and correct the mistakes of his past marriage.  Valerie Dobbins is a younger professional who realizes that, in meeting Bill, she is trusting a man for the first time in her life. She sees in Bill a man that has the adventurous spirit she seeks in a relationship.  But as much as she is drawn to Bill, she feels conflicted about moving forward as she struggles to overcome a devastating event in her childhood.  The Red Mill Series is a trilogy about dating with differences in life, courtship and marriage, and a woman&#39;s struggle of trying to fit into another familys life as a new wife and mother.  The question that remains to be answered is, &quot;How does suffering fit into Gods will for our lives?&quot;  Winter&#39;s Edge is the first of an ongoing series about love, God&#39;s plan for our life and preparing us through suffering for a future ministry." />
