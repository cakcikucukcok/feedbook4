  <title>To Win Her Favor - Tamera Alexander</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;If you read one historical novel this year, make it &lt;em&gt;To Win Her Favor&lt;/em&gt;. It will linger with you long after the last page.&amp;rdquo; &amp;mdash;Colleen Coble, &lt;em&gt;USA TODAY&lt;/em&gt; bestselling author of &lt;em&gt;The House at Saltwater Point&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A gifted rider in a world where ladies never race, Maggie Linden is determined that her horse will become a champion. But the one man who could help her has vowed to stay away from thoroughbred racing forever.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An Irishman far from home, Cullen McGrath left a once prosperous life in England because of a horse racing scandal that nearly ruined him. He&amp;rsquo;s come to Nashville for a fresh start, hoping to buy land and begin farming, all while determined to stay as far away from thoroughbred racing as possible. But starting over proves harder than he&#39;d wagered, especially when Maggie Linden&#39;s father makes him an offer he shouldn&#39;t accept yet cannot possibly refuse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Maggie is certain that her mare, Bourbon Belle, can take the top purse in the inaugural Peyton Stakes, the richest race ever run in America. Maggie only needs the chance to prove it. To give her that chance, and to save Linden Downs from being sold to the highest bidder, Maggie&#39;s father&amp;mdash;aging, yet wily as ever&amp;mdash;makes a barter. His agreement includes one tiny, troublesome detail: that Maggie must marry a man she&#39;s never met. A man she never would have chosen for herself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Set against the post-Civil War history of Nashville&amp;rsquo;s historic Belle Meade Plantation, the most influential thoroughbred stud farm in America&amp;rsquo;s history, &lt;em&gt;To Win Her Favor&lt;/em&gt; is a passionate, stirring, and highly acclaimed novel readers won&amp;rsquo;t soon forget.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;&lt;em&gt;To Win Her Favor &lt;/em&gt;is a beautiful love story, not to mention a story of faith that shines through in the darkest circumstances. From the very beginning, I lost my heart to Cullen and Maggie and yearned for the moment when they would lose their hearts to each other.&amp;rdquo; &amp;mdash;Robin Lee Hatcher, bestselling author of &lt;em&gt;Who I Am with You&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Tamera Alexander is one of my favorite authors, so I expect a lot from her novels. &lt;em&gt;To Win Her Favor&lt;/em&gt; is captivating beyond expectation! This novel has everything readers are looking for&amp;mdash;rich characterization, page-turning intrigue, a heartwarming romance charged with tension, and more!&amp;rdquo; &amp;mdash;Cindy Woodsmall, &lt;em&gt;New York Times &lt;/em&gt;and CBA bestselling author&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Tamera Alexander has done it again. Her imagination and skillful pen intertwined with history takes the reader on a beautiful journey. &lt;em&gt;To Win Her Favor&lt;/em&gt; is sure to stir the heart and open the mind.&amp;rdquo; &amp;mdash;Jenny Lamb, Director of Interpretation &amp;amp; Education, Belle Meade Mansion&lt;/p&gt;" />
