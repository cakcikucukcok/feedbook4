  <title>Tappin&#39; On Thirty - Candice Dow</title>
      <meta name="description" content="From Candice Dow comes a sexy, soul searching novel about love lost, new beginnings, and the big   3-0.  .  .&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;    As a successful legal consultant, Devin Patterson&#39;s professional life is good. But his personal life is another story. Devin let his true love slip away when his now ex-wife intentionally got pregnant. He loves his six-year-old daughter, but as the clock ticks on his thirtieth birthday, he can&#39;t help reminiscing about the past--and he&#39;s not alone.  .  .  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  With her model looks and her law career, people wonder why Taylor Jabowski is still single as she&#39;s approaching her thirtieth birthday. But Taylor knows exactly why: Scooter, the high school sweetheart she broke up with when she was young and foolish. She hasn&#39;t been in love since, and with her class reunion coming up, Taylor can&#39;t help fantasizing about winning him back.  .  .  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  As Devin opens his heart to the idea of a new relationship, and Taylor tries to re-connect with Scooter, their paths cross. They discover they have more in common than regrets from the past. Now that they&#39;re older and wiser, can they figure it out?" />
