  <title>The Baxters Take Three - Karen Kingsbury</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Chase Ryan and Keith Ellison set out to change the world with their films&amp;mdash;and they are finally seeing their dreams come true. The dedicated producers are deep in negotiations with America&amp;rsquo;s top young movie star to play the lead in their next inspirational movie. But life takes a sudden turn for Chase, removing him from Jeremiah Productions permanently. In the process, Keith brings on one of the Baxter family members and the moviemaking continues. At the same time, a crisis hits Keith&amp;rsquo;s daughter, Andi, and Keith feels helpless to respond. Devastated by the consequences of her wrong actions, Andi ventures out on her own and decides on a course of action that could destroy her. Meanwhile, Bailey Flanigan is caught up in her own drama with Cody Coleman. A Campus Crusade retreat gives them time alone along the shores of Lake Monroe and lets them face a possibility they&amp;rsquo;ve avoided for years. Will Keith keep the passion he had at the start of his filmmaking&amp;mdash;and will there be enough passion left over for his hurting daughter? Or has their quest to change American culture become nothing more than a quest for fame?&lt;/p&gt;" />
