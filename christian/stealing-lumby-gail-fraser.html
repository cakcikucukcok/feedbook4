  <title>Stealing Lumby - Gail Fraser</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;2017 Edition! Book #2 in the Lumby series. What Garrison Keillor did for Lake Wobegon and Jan Karon did for Mitford, Gail Fraser has done for Lumby - a town so heartwarming and endearing, you&amp;#39;ll be forever transported. When one of the most important paintings of the twentieth century, &lt;em&gt;The Barns of Lumby&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;is stolen from an international gallery, the small town of the painting&amp;rsquo;s setting is pulled from anonymity and spread across the front pages of every major newspaper in the country. As a media frenzy descends on Lumby, and the camera-shy owner of the barns tries to find shelter on her farm, one of the two actual barns disappears from the landscape&amp;mdash;and pieces of old barn wood begin showing up all over town, and in the strangest of places. It even has the monks mystified; how could the new pews in the chapel at St. Cross Abbey be linked to the stolen barn? Inn owners, Pam and Mark Walker, roll up their sleeves to help the brothers as well as the town while trying to manage their own projects, including planting gum trees for their bees to produce rare honey and caring for an expanding critter collection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Town matriarch, Charlotte Ross, has a very personal connection to the painting&amp;mdash;and to the artist, Dana Porter, but she keeps her story close to her heart. When Dana Porter finally returns to Lumby, it might be too late to relive his past, but the town and painting give him a new outlook on life&amp;mdash;one that he will forever remember. And he quickly learns that when times get tough in the town of Lumby, there is no better person to turn to than your nearest neighbor or your closest friend.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;" />
