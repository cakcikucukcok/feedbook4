  <title>In Danger - Naomi L. Carter</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Charlene (Charlie) Weaver likes to look out the window of her apartment while drinking her morning coffee. She doesn&#39;t know that practice can put her life in danger, or that one day it will change her whole life forever. She is a talented (and hopefully, lucky) amateur sleuth. Will that be enough? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tom Starn is an investigator for the district attorney&#39;s office, tasked with protecting material witnesses. He doesn&#39;t know that protecting Charlie Weaver will change his life too. Will what he knows be adequate to keep both him and Charlie safe? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An explosion at the safe house will send them running for their lives. That&#39;s just the tip of the icebergthe first terrifying revelation that someone was not fooled into believing that the fiery explosion of Charlie&#39;s car signified her death, and that the planned escape into the Federal Witness Protection Program will not provide protection after all. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Can they make good their escape and establish a trust in each other? At present, they don&#39;t know if there is anyone else they can trust. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While they trust their lives to each other, can they trust their hearts to each other as well? Will their growing attraction to each other make them more vulnerable, or will it make them better able to overcome the dangers and obstacles? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Will they want each other when this is over? &lt;/p&gt;" />
