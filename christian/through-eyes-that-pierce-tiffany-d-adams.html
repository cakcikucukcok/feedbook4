  <title>Through Eyes That Pierce - Tiffany D. Adams</title>
      <meta name="description" content="After years of dealing with her past of physical and sexual abuse, Simone is finally coming into her own. She has a successful career in real estate, amazing friends, and a past she would like to forget. As she takes on this new attitude on life, falling in love was not on her to-do list. She didnt believe in love, until she met Jackson Pierce, the soon-to-be well-known smooth, sexy, urban artist of Houston. Jackson could connect with the feeling of love. He didnt think he could find true love, until he found her. After letting down the wire fences that guarded their hearts, Simone finds herself opening up about her past. But she soon regrets her decision after discovering Jackson had a past of his own. Questioning who Jackson really was, Simone wonders if love really conquers all. By the time she finds out for herself, tragedy strikes. She asks herself, Love may conquer all, but does it save the one that holds your heart?" />
