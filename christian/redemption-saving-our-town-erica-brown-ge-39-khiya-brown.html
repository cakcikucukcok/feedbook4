  <title>Redemption: Saving Our Town - Erica Brown, Ge&#39;Khiya Brown</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Our Inspiration:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This story was inspired by my daughter and her very vivid imagination. All of the illustrations are her original drawings. As in the book Charlottes Web, this story also features several savvy characters that form camaraderie  to save the lives of their friends. Among these is twelve-year-old Crazi Boui Palmer (aka CB) who is very determined to free his town from an evil spell. Actually, the overall plot of the story is similar to the all-time favorite cartoon, Super Friends, in that no matter how evil the villain, the FRIENDS always unite and conquer. It is action-packed from beginning to end! Its a great read for all ages!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About the book:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Redemption: Saving Our Town is set as a riveting, modern-day chain of events. Its tone highlights the existence of stolen morality. If he is going to reverse the curse of illogical mindsets among his fellow townspeople, then CB Palmer needs to cleverly evolve a plan, immediately! A plan to correct warped ways of thinking, that is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You see, CB, along with a few other townspeople, managed to escape the mind-altering, invisible gas invented by  Mr. Smoke Choo (the evil Chemist). With grave perseverance CB, Officer Man Mouse (the town cop), and Call~a~doo~dee~Girl (a special friend) lead the others in a daring escapade! The intent is to counteract Mr. Choos wicked scheme to corrupt their thought patterns and violate their life-standards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, Officer Mouse discovers something extremely interesting. Then, he calls for a secret meeting. Sure enough, after sharing details from his investigation, they manage to unfold Mr. Choos conspiracy. Unknowingly, their source of rescue just happens to be something they all have in common: Eggs!!!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let the brainstorming begin, stated CB. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Get your copy, sit back, relax, and allow your imagination to flourish! Buy it today!!&lt;/p&gt;" />
