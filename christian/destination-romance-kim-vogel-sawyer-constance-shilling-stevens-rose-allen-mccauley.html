  <title>Destination: Romance - Kim Vogel Sawyer, Constance Shilling Stevens, Rose Allen McCauley</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;From a cave in the hills of Missouri to a sandy beach in Grand Cayman, romance blooms for five heroines when they least expect it.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bare Feet and Warm Sand&lt;/em&gt; BY Kim Vogel Sawyer&lt;br /&gt;
Marine biologist Tamiera is determined to protect endangered sea turtles against man&amp;rsquo;s intrusion. When Joe arrives on the island of Grand Cayman with plans to build a resort near the turtles&amp;rsquo; nesting grounds, will she be able to convince him to put the needs of God&amp;rsquo;s creatures above making money?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sufficient Grace&lt;/em&gt; BY Constance Shilling Stevens&lt;br /&gt;
An abandoned Cherokee burial ground keeps secrets and draws a picture of deep, enduring love for Nora, but land surveyor Donovan threatens the place that holds sweet memories for Nora&amp;rsquo;s grandfather. Will Donovan follow his boss&amp;rsquo;s orders or follow his heart?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Better Together Than Apart &lt;/em&gt;BY Rose Allen McCauley&lt;br /&gt;
On a K-Love cruise to Jamaica, Natalie re-connects with Ken, a boy she met six years earlier on a high school summer mission trip. Attraction stirs, but opposing goals threaten their romance. Will they listen to God&amp;rsquo;s leading for their best place of service?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A Shelter in a Weary Land&lt;/em&gt; BY Julane Hiebert&lt;br /&gt;
A cave in the Missouri hillside was to be a shelter from pillaging Union soldiers for Charlotte and her unborn babe. But will she be safe when a wounded enemy seeks the same place of refuge?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Cotton Candy Sky&lt;/em&gt; BY Kristian Libel&lt;br /&gt;
When a Kansas girl falls in love with the ocean, she thinks nothing could be more exhilarating than life on a beach...except maybe falling for a traveling photographer who introduces her to more adventure than she&amp;rsquo;d ever imagined. But is their connection one that can last, or will their time together simply remain a fond memory as they go their separate ways?&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;" />
