  <title>Finally and   Forever - Robin Jones Gunn</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;What was she thinking?&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Katie Weldon wonders if she was crazy to spontaneously fly off to Africa on a mission trip. Suddenly she is dealing with a new culture, a world she’s never experienced—and Eli, a friend who is quickly becoming much more. It’s all overwhelming … and exciting. As her life turns topsy-turvy, however, she begins to think this might be exactly what she needs. Here, God might give her a glimpse into His will for her life. But just as Kenya and its people find a place in her heart, and her relationship with Eli begins to get serious, Katie is faced with unanswered questions from her past and unresolved issues with Eli. Is she really headed down the same path into the future he is? It doesn&#39;t look like it. Why can&#39;t she finally and forever settle into a set direction? Living in this new and captivating place, one thing she knows for sure: anything might be possible.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Finally and Forever &lt;/EM&gt;is the final book in the Katie Weldon Series.&lt;/P&gt;" />
