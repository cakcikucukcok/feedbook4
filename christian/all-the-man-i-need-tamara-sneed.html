  <title>All The Man I Need - Tamara Sneed</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&quot;An entertaining romance with spices of drama, comedy and action mixed in.&quot; - &lt;i&gt;RT Book Review&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;She Thinks She Knows It All...&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;Public relations powerhouse Lana Hargrove is ready to settle down as long as it&#39;s with a man who fits into her elite, social-climbing lifestyle. And that man is definitely not Justin Larkin, the hot-blooded P.I. who&#39;s been following her all over town. So why can&#39;t Lana stop thinking about how good it would feel to climb into his arms and hold on tight?&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;But The Last Man She Wants...&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;Justin Larkin doesn&#39;t like to mix with pleasure, but he can&#39;t deny that following the luscious Lana Hargrove is pure bliss. Justin&#39;s latest assignment is to find Lana&#39;s art-thief father. As things heat up, he fears Lana may be in danger. Now it&#39;s up to Justin to keep her safe-even if it&#39;s from his own runaway desire!&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;Is Exactly Who She Needs...&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;Justin&#39;s case spirals out of control when he discovers that an enemy of Lana&#39;s father is targeting her to get even. He and Lana will have to join forces if they want to escape with their lives. But as tensions mount, their intense attraction threatens to boil over-and each kiss they share may be their last, in All The Man I Need by Tamara Sneed.&lt;/p&gt;" />
