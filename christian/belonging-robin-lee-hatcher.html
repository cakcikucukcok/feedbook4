  <title>Belonging - Robin Lee Hatcher</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;In the high desert town of Frenchman&amp;rsquo;s Bluff, Idaho, Felicia Kristoffersen has set out to create a future for herself that is better than her painful past. Alone in the world with only her faith to sustain her, she must prove herself as this tiny community&amp;rsquo;s new school teacher. She cannot, must not, fail. But, there are those who never wanted her there to begin with. Five years after the death of his wife, local merchant Colin Murphy cares about just one thing: raising his daughter, Charity. Colin wants to give her the educational advantages he never had. The new schoolmarm&amp;rsquo;s inexperience doesn&amp;rsquo;t sit well with him, and if this teacher up and marries like the last one did, Charity&amp;rsquo;s heart will be broken once again. A woman who hasn&amp;rsquo;t known love. A man who lost the love he had. In the midst of the wide, sage-covered plains, each is about to discover that life&amp;rsquo;s bitterest circumstances truly can work together for good. Tender, evocative, and beautifully written, Belonging is a journey about love after loss, and about two hearts destined to become one&amp;mdash;despite their stubbornness! Belonging is Robin Lee Hatcher at her best! &amp;mdash;Tamera Alexander, bestselling author of Within My Heart and The Inheritance Belonging is vintage Robin Lee Hatcher: a touching, tender love story, filled with genuine conflict and characters that quietly build a nest in your heart. A skillful blend of description, emotion, and spiritual reflection, Belonging will sweep you away to late nineteenth-century Idaho, glad to have a seasoned novelist driving your buckboard wagon with a sure hand. By story&#39;s end you&#39;ll no doubt sigh with relief, smile with delight, and turn back to page one for a second visit with our determined Miss K.
