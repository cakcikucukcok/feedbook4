  <title>Sisters of Grace - Katherine Trent</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Thirty year old journalist Olivia Barrett loves her life in the Windy City. Her career, however, is a different story- literally. Being a journalist for Southern Elegance and Traditions Magazine is just a pebble in the stepping stones it will take to get to the top of the journalistic world... or so she thinks.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;When an assignment to Manchester, Mississippi throws Olivia face to face with the issues she chooses to ignore, she will discover that even the purest of gold has to be refined by fire. As she interviews the manor residents, twelve gracefully aging southern belles, she finds that the true beauty of Granview Manor is not on the outside but on the inside. Over the course of her assignment Olivia discovers that wisdom is acquired through observation or experience and maybe she doesnt have to learn everything the hard way. It isnt long before she realizes that she wants what these women have, but does she have what it will take to lead a life of virtue?&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Besides being captivated by each individual journey, Olivia is witness to the truth, wisdom and faith that is shared by women of all ages and geographic locations. Read and discover why Olivia felt as if she was living a life of meaning, until she found the true meaning of life among the Sisters of Grace.&lt;/p&gt;" />
