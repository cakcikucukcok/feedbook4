  <title>Dear Lady - Robin Lee Hatcher</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Dear Mary, New Prospects, Montana, is nothing like England&amp;mdash;so terrifying and beautiful at the same time, and much larger than I dared imagine when you and I first embarked on our adventures in the New World. I have had the good fortune of becoming the town&amp;rsquo;s schoolmistress. Young Janie Steele is as precious as I imagined from her letters. As for her father, Garret Steele . . . Oh, I feel like such a fool! I&amp;rsquo;ve run halfway around the world to escape a man I loathed, only to discover I&amp;rsquo;m losing my heart to a man still in love with the wife he buried. The mayor, kind man, has been most attentive. But I wish he were someone else. I wish he were Garret. With affection, Your friend Beth Wellington In the big-sky country of Montana, the past doesn&amp;rsquo;t always stay buried. Circumstances have a way of forcing secrets into the open, sometimes bringing hearts together in unlikely ways, and sometimes tearing them apart. Dear Lady is Book One in the Coming to America series about women who come to America to start new lives. Set in the late 1800s and early 1900s, these novels by best-selling author Robin Lee Hatcher craft intense chemistry and conflict between the characters, lit by a glowing faith and humanity that will win your heart. Look for other books in the series at your favorite Christian bookstore.&lt;/p&gt;" />
