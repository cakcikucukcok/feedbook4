  <title>That Devil&#39;s No Friend of Mine - J. D. Mason</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;When Bishop Fontaine passed away he left behind more than a list of good deeds.  He was known as a caring friend and doting father. . .but he was also manipulative and controlling, especially to those he loved.  His death begins to unravel deep secrets and shocking desires among the people he cared about the most. . .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His daughter, Kristine, feels that with her father&#39;s death she is finally free.  His best friend and business partner, Lamar, feels that now can finally have what he has longed for all these years: Kristine.  His protégé, Cole, the boxing champion and rising star, married a woman Bishop never approved of and may have been right about.  Rayne, the blues singer and ex-junkie relied on Bishop to keep her clean and is now slipping down a dark path without him.  And Rhonda, Lamar&#39;s wife, is determined to ignore what has been unfolding in front of her if it means that her predictable life will go unchanged.  And then a newcomer steps onto the scene and threatens to turn everything upside down.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Five very different people whose lives are only connected by Bishop suddenly find themselves up close and personal as desires, dreams and passions collide.&lt;/p&gt;" />
