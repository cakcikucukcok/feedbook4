  <title>Along Came Love - Tracey Livesay</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;When a silly, impulsive decision lands free-spirited India Shaw behind bars in San Francisco, she has no choice but to call the only person she knows in the unfamiliar city&amp;#8212;the very man she abandoned after a steamy two-day fling. The fact that she&amp;#8217;s pregnant with his child is something she&amp;#8217;d rather not divulge. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tech executive Michael Black never thought he&amp;#8217;d hear from the quirky beauty after she left his bed four months ago, much less be called upon to post bail. He&amp;#8217;s got his hands full with a corporate merger that could make or break his career, but his honorable nature&amp;#8212;and an overwhelming need to see her again&amp;#8212;means he can&amp;#8217;t just leave her in jail. And when India reveals the truth about her pregnancy, Mike insists she stay with him until the baby is born.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;India doesn&amp;#8217;t want to depend on him for anything, but their constant proximity stirs up feelings she can&amp;#8217;t ignore. She&amp;#8217;s never desired a family before and she knows a future with Mike isn&amp;#8217;t possible . . . but then along came love to shake up all her plans. &lt;/p&gt;" />
