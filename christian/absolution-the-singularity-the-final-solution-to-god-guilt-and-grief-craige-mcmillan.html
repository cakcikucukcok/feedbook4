  <title>Absolution The Singularity: The Final Solution to God, Guilt and Grief? - Craige McMillan</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Pope Pious is not whom he appears to be. He is traveling from Switzerland to a remote orphanage in Brazil under an assumed name&amp;mdash;because the church hierarchy in South America wants him gone. But someone even more important has given him this assignment.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Odessa is in love with an admiral. His ships, far off the coast of Alaska, fly no flag. Now he has asked her to go in his place&amp;mdash;to a Brazilian orphanage they once visited together. The children there are dying. She takes a handwritten list of names he passes to her. &amp;ldquo;Oh, my God!&amp;rdquo; Odessa whispers, as she reads the names. &amp;ldquo;I know what you want me to do!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Natavia has just finished the Christmas Eve service for eight-thousand people at her Colorado church. They&amp;rsquo;ve all left. She&amp;rsquo;s alone. She sits quietly in the senior pastor&amp;rsquo;s office, handling the knife as she decides whether to end her life&amp;mdash;and the fraud it has been. On the frozen pond outside her office, she sees a girl skating. The girl looks very much like Julie, her daughter. But Julie died eight years ago.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The supernatural has invaded our world. Will technology give us control over the veil of eternity?&lt;/p&gt;" />
