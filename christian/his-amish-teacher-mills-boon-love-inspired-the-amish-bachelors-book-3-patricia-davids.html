  <title>His Amish Teacher (Mills &amp; Boon Love Inspired) (The Amish Bachelors, Book 3) - Patricia Davids</title>
      <meta name="description" content="
        &lt;p&gt;The Teacher&#39;s Choice&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;For Lillian Keim, instructing children in her one-room schoolhouse is as close to being a mother as she’ll ever get. Lillian has a calling to be a teacher, and she won&#39;t give it up to marry. But her plans—and her heart—are at risk when she begins to feel more than friendship for lifelong pal Timothy Bowman. When Tim rescues Lillian and her class from a fire, the volunteer firefighter suddenly sees what he&#39;s been blind to all his life: he wants his friend as his wife. But something beyond her professional goals is holding Lillian back. He&#39;s got to unlock her secret before he loses his friend—and his forever love.&lt;/p&gt;
