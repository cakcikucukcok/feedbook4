  <title>Betrayed - Nikki C.</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Courtney, is a devoted, hardworking entrepreneur ambushed by her friends for a night of drinking and partying at the local bar. No longer used to the wild social scene she sits at a table alone to rest her aching feet and take in the scene around her. She is approached by Devin, the handsome stranger, whom interrupts her thoughts. In the weeks to come, despite her hectic work schedule, they form a connection. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Her best friend, Bianca, has more of a wild side. When she discovers a side of her boyfriend that she never knew existed, she leans on Courtney for support. Good friend that she is, Courtney opens her home to Bianca as a safe place to stay. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the coming months, Devin has all the right moves where Courtney is concerned. Despite her level head, she finds herself madly in love, but Devin holds a life changing secret that only he and Bianca knows. After a heated argument, will Devin come clean to Courtney at the risk of ending their relationship, or will he take his deep, dark secret all the way to the alter? &lt;/p&gt;" />
