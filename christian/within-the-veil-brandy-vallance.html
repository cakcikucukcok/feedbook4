  <title>Within the Veil - Brandy Vallance</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;They never should have met. But they might be made for each other.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Feya Broon, a Scottish half Gypsy, knows what it is to go hungry. Trapped in the Edinburgh tenements with a father lost to his past and only the faded memory of her mother&amp;#39;s faith, Feya is desperate to provide for her siblings. When an ill-conceived plan leads to thievery, she finds herself in the last place she&amp;#39;d ever want to be--captured by a palace guard. But there&amp;#39;s something about this man that tears at every preconceived notion she&amp;#39;s ever had about the haughty English.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alasdair Cairncross never dreamed he&amp;#39;d be forced to transport a Gypsy woman halfway across the wilds of Scotland. The timing is disastrous, considering his fianc&amp;eacute;e&amp;#39;s imminent arrival and his father&amp;#39;s political goals. Not only that, but the fiery young woman threatens to lay bare secrets Alasdair would rather keep hidden. And yet the farther they travel together, the less concerned he finds himself with duty--both to the crown and to the plans his family has for him. As their walls begin to crumble, Feya and Alasdair must fight to survive a decades-old feud, a Highland kidnapping, and the awakening of their own hearts.&lt;/p&gt;" />
