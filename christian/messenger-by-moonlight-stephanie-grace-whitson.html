  <title>Messenger by Moonlight - Stephanie Grace Whitson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;b&gt;Bestselling author Stephanie Grace Whitson&#39;s latest historical novel features an adventurous young heroine who works for the Pony Express.&lt;/b&gt;  &lt;div&gt;Orphaned Annie Paxton and her brothers may have lost the only home they&#39;ve ever known, but they&#39;re determined to make a better future in St. Joseph, Missouri. Annie dreams of a pretty house with window boxes, and having friends, and attending church every week. But then her brothers spot the ad for a new venture called the Pony Express. &quot;Wanted,&quot; it reads, &quot;Young, skinny fellows not over eighteen. Must be expert riders and willing to risk death daily. Orphans preferred.&quot; Sure enough, both her brothers land jobs as Express messengers, and Annie puts her dreams on hold to work as a cook at Clearwater Ranch, a station along the Pony Express route. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Annie struggles to adapt to her new job--work made all the more challenging when she has so many to feed and few ingredients. The gruff station owner, George, doesn&#39;t seem inclined to make her life any easier, or at least not at first. But slowly a friendship builds between them. When Annie attracts the attention of a refined, dashing lieutenant from the nearby fort, she&#39;ll have to learn how to trust her instincts and follow her heart, even if she&#39;s conflicted about which way it&#39;s leading her.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;" />
