  <title>The New ABC&#39;s of Life for Children and Adults: Short Stories, Essays, and Poems Promoting Christian Concepts - Pamela Kaye Orgeron, Milton Joseph Orgeron</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;__DdeLink__20_4809382261&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;__DdeLink__11_1836978262&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;__DdeLink__14_1107339578&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;em&gt;The New &lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;ABC&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;#39;s of Life for Children and Adults: Short Stories, Essays, and Poems Promoting Christian Concepts&lt;/em&gt; is a revised and expanded edition of the book &lt;em&gt;The &lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;ABC&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;#39;s of Life for Children and Adults: Short Stories, Essays, and Poems Promoting Christian Concepts&lt;/em&gt; (Xulon Press, 2003), written by the author under her maiden name. Both books depict Biblical principles and morals of life that society seems to have lost. By writing both books, the author hopes to teach children, and remind adults about values such as honesty, decency and a strong work ethic by emphasizing their importance throughout each book.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;ABC&amp;#39;s&amp;rdquo; is an acronym for: &lt;u&gt;A&lt;/u&gt;bolishing apathetic attitudes; &lt;u&gt;B&lt;/u&gt;uilding Biblical behavior patterns; and, &lt;u&gt;C&lt;/u&gt;hoosing Christ-like character. The author believes that through reminding ourselves and teaching our children about healthy attitudes and behavior, Christians could make a difference that would result in worldwide revival. She thinks, &lt;em&gt;Christ-like character needs to be displayed and encouraged by Christians of all denominations.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;__DdeLink__21_6426961711&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;em&gt;The &lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;ABC&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;#39;s of Life for Children and Adults&lt;/em&gt; is divided into three sections: 1. &amp;quot;Fiction for the Children&amp;quot;; 2. Nonfiction material, &amp;quot;Lessons Learned from Life&amp;#39;s Realities&amp;quot;, developed from experiences in the author&amp;rsquo;s life, or the lives of individuals influential in her life; and, 3. &amp;ldquo;Moments from the Heart&amp;rdquo;, which contains the lyrics of a collection of songs the author wrote. In addition, this section includes poetry written by either the author or her father. &lt;em&gt;The &lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;ABC&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;#39;s of Life for Children and Adults&lt;/em&gt; concludes with a list of what the author entitles ABC&amp;#39;s TO SUCCESSFUL LIVING. The list includes positive qualities, which the author hopes everyone reading either edition of her books would strive to possess.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;To &lt;em&gt;The&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; New &lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;ABC&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;#39;s of Life for Children and Adults&lt;/em&gt;, the author added &amp;ldquo;Questions for Reflection&amp;rdquo; at the end of each fiction and non-fiction story. Scripture references and their application have been added at the end of each fiction story for children. These additions were prompted by the number of parents who told the author they had used the earlier version of this book as a devotional guide with their children. The author also made revisions in the book chapters and included new stories and poems not previously published.&lt;/p&gt;" />
