  <title>Dragon Roar - Joseph Kram</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Dont talk to ME about fair!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When your memory and identity has stripped from you, what are you left with? The young Dragon Keeper Mataras wonders this very question nearly every day as he searches for the answers to a past that may never come to light. Even with his best friend by his side, and the God of all to look up to, he feels lost, alone, and bitter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But what begins as a disaster quickly becomes an adventure worthy of legend as Mataras and Delta Litrosh begin a journey to unveil a mystery as old as the Great Flood of Genesis. During their travels, they meet up with a group of other troubled youths, also seeking their place in the world, and decide to assist them in their endeavors. Together, they become a capable group of warriors capable of shaking the foundations of an entire fief.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When push comes to shove and Mataras past comes to confront him, will this unstable child be able to take on the mantle of manhood? Will he be able to hear the Kings voice in the form of a mighty dragons roar?&lt;/p&gt;" />
