  <title>Paris Mafia Princess: A chick lit of finding love, a beautiful wedding and a secret baby (romance books, romance novel, inspirational book, chapters b - Nerissa Marie</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Paris Mafia Princess -&amp;nbsp; A chick lit of finding love, a beautiful wedding and a secret baby by Nerissa Marie is a Fiction - Romantic Comedy, Rom Com, Chick Lit&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;A chick lit of finding love, a beautiful wedding and a secret baby. This positive, uplifting, and inspirational novel is set in Paris France and Monaco.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;When fate hands you the perfect woman, it&amp;rsquo;s easy to know what to do. For aristocrat, Hugo de La Laville, life&amp;rsquo;s a little more complicated. He has three perfect, potential fianc&amp;eacute;es&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Hugo is a writer and property heir, who&amp;rsquo;s just been dumped by his movie star girlfriend. Heartbroken Hugo feels grief as though he&amp;rsquo;s just been through a divorce. He isn&amp;rsquo;t ready to begin dating again, meeting new single women, let alone consider family life. His best friend conspires with his sister seeing he needs to progress from this slump, into a happy relationship. They decide to have a competition to find him the perfect girlfriend and mend his broken heart.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Fleur, Hugo&amp;rsquo;s high school sweetheart; Tabby, a jewelry designer from London, England; and Sophia, a married, passionate New Yorker, are chosen - unawares - as contenders for this larger than life, The Bachelor, style experiment. When the women discover Hugo is dating all three of them, they become competitive, friendship blossoms, and a plan to avenge the wrath of all cheating men is formed.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Paris Mafia Princess explores the time we waste on trying to get even and finding the right partner at all costs. How our natural competitive instinct can be used constructively, and why we sometimes forget that the most important relationship we have in life is the one we develop within ourselves.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Fantastic buy and one of the best new romance ebooks! One of the best chick lit, rom com books I&amp;rsquo;ve read. &amp;nbsp;- &lt;strong&gt;Sunshine Post Gazette&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Definitely one of the inspirational chick lit best sellers of 2016. Best chick lit new release! - &lt;strong&gt;New York Publications&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I adore romantic comedy novels.
