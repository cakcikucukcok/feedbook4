  <title>A Daughters of the Promise Collection - Beth Wiseman</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;From best-selling novelist Beth Wiseman, three complete stories about living and loving plain in Lancaster County&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Plain Promise&lt;/em&gt;&amp;ugrave;Winters can be brutally cold and lonely in Pennsylvania. Young Amish widow Sadie Fisher rejoices when a renter leases her guest cottage. Kade Saunders turns out to be impulsive, frustrating, and attractive&amp;ugrave;but romance with an &lt;em&gt;Englischer&lt;/em&gt; is forbidden according to the &lt;em&gt;Ordnung&lt;/em&gt;. Soon Kade is surprised with custody of a child he barely knows&amp;ugrave;his five-year-old autistic son, Tyler. Though their worlds seem far apart, Sadie and Kade soon find their hearts warming in the depths of winter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Plain Paradise&lt;/em&gt;&amp;ugrave;Linda&amp;AElig;s Amish life seems like paradise. The bishop&amp;AElig;s grandson has been courting her and may propose soon. Then she discovers that she&amp;AElig;s adopted. Her birth mother, Josie, comes to town and Linda finds herself drawn to Josie&amp;AElig;s world. Meanwhile, Linda&amp;AElig;s adoptive parents and her Amish beau struggle to understand how this interruption could possibly be God&amp;AElig;s will. As new relationships begin and old ones are tested, no one&amp;AElig;s life will remain the same.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Plain Proposal&lt;/em&gt;&amp;ugrave;Miriam Raber could have her pick of any bachelor in Lancaster County, but she only has eyes for Saul Fisher. Even when rumors circulate that he may leave the Amish community to pursue a once-in-a-lifetime apprenticeship, Miriam makes a bold assertion: she will stand by him, whether he stays or goes. As Miriam and Saul consider leaving their lives behind, God starts revealing things to Miriam that make her think twice about what it means to be a Daughter of the Promise.&lt;/p&gt;" />
