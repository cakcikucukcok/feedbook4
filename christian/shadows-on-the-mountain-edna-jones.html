&lt;p&gt;Book three: Reflections in a Stream (to be published in the near future)&lt;?p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;At the turn of the twentieth century, the communities nestled within the Blue Ridge Mountains were thought to be developmentally a hundred years behind the rest of the country. It was into this environ that Dr. Jim Bradley felt a calling to minister through medicine to people who were often bound by superstition and home remedies.&lt;/p&gt;

From beginning to end, the Blue Ridge Trilogy spans a period of fourteen years and will leave you convinced that faith and love always find a way.&lt;/p&gt;" />
