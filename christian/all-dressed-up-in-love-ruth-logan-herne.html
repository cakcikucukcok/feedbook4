  <title>All Dressed Up in Love - Ruth Logan Herne</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tara walks into Elena&amp;rsquo;s Bridal and finds her dream job&amp;mdash;and a handsome man to match. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A third-year law student, Tara Simonetti just needs a job to pay the bills and put food on the table. After her father&amp;rsquo;s untimely death, she&amp;rsquo;s determined to give her small hometown what he didn&amp;rsquo;t have: a good, honest lawyer, but law school isn&amp;rsquo;t cheap. When she answers a want ad that leads her to Elena&amp;rsquo;s Bridal one blustery morning, she feels like she&amp;rsquo;s died and gone to heaven. All of the organza, gowns, and pearls she could ever imagine&amp;mdash;her dream job, indeed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To complicate matters, hotshot lawyer Greg Elizondo is working at the shop, trying to keep it afloat after his mother&amp;rsquo;s passing. He&amp;rsquo;s kind and more handsome than Tara cares to admit, but his laser-focus on the corporate ladder makes him the wrong match for her.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As they work to save the shop from its impending closing, their feelings begin to grow. But with Tara bound for the valleys of northern Pennsylvania and Greg set on New York City, all of the outside circumstances scream &amp;ldquo;NO.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the midst of juggling Bridezillas, wedding dress orders, and an upcoming gala for the shop, their attraction deepens, along with the reality that their goals are pulling them in two separate directions. No matter how Tara does the math, it doesn&amp;rsquo;t add up. Can God orchestrate their desires and goals into one happy ending?&lt;/p&gt;" />
