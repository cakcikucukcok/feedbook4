  <title>Pony Express Christmas Bride (Mills &amp; Boon Love Inspired Historical) (Saddles and Spurs, Book 3) - Rhonda Gibson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="
        &lt;p&gt;Want Ad Wife&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Mail-order bride Josephine Dooley’s trip west was supposed to end in marriage to her intended groom—not with the discovery that he hadn’t actually placed the bridal ad! Now her only choice is to convince pony express rider Thomas Young to wed her anyway, to save her from her scheming uncle.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;A bride shouldn’t be a surprise package and when Thomas finds out about his meddling brother’s ruse, he plans to send his would-be wife packing. However, when he realizes Josephine desperately needs his help and a marriage of convenience is the only way he can protect her, he vows to become the husband she needs. But he quickly learns that it will be hard to keep his new bride at arm’s length…because Josephine is his perfect match.&lt;/p&gt;
