  <title>Oriel&#39;s Diary - Robert Harrison</title>
      <meta name="description" content="A fresh take on the most significant person who ever lived!
Oriel opens his diary in Heaven&#39;s administration department, as his Boss&#39;s plan to rescue humanity swings into action with the sending of a colleague to visit a teenage girl in Nazareth...
The personal diary of Archangel Oriel, colleague of Gabriel and Michael, records the birth, life, death and resurrection of Jesus Christ. Closely based on Luke&#39;s Gospel, Oriel&#39;s Diary presents an entirely original view of a familiar story.
Author Robert Harrison describes his book as &#39;a mixture of biblical fact and creative fictionalisation&#39;. His model is Jesus himself. &#39;Jesus deliberately communicated his message in stories because they hold divine truth more effectively than intellectual debate.&#39;
Engage your heart and imagination with this compelling, humorous and moving story.
The first of a best-selling seriers, Oriel&#39;s Diary is told from the perspective of Oriel, one of the angelic host and an archangel colleague of Gabriel and Michael. This fictionalised re-telling of the life of Jesus is closely based on Luke&#39;s Gospel and opens with the Boss giving the go-ahead to initiate the plan of salvation and Gabriel about to appear to Mary to announce the birth of Jesus. A fresh view of a very familiar story giving, as it were, sneak insights into God&#39;s intentions. Very entertaining, often humorous, and sometimes very moving, this book will appeal to both Christians and non-Christians." />
