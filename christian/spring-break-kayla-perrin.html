  <title>Spring Break - Kayla Perrin</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;With a breakneck pace and cat-and-mouse twists, &lt;i&gt;Spring Break&lt;/i&gt; is the ultimate beach read. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Help me . . .&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These are the last words Chanetelle hears from her friend Ashley, in a static-filled phone call that soon goes dead. Their trip to the island paradise of Artula started the way any trip should, and soon Chanetelle and her friends find themselves in sun-drenched days and party-hopping nights. The vacation is not without its conflicts, however, and old rivalries and new jealousies come to light as the week passes. But no one expects things to turn as ugly as they do. No one expects that they won&#39;t all return. And no one expects that murder might be the ultimate souvenir. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Ashley disappears, the question is asked: Was it a random act of violence? Or is something more sinister going on? And is Ashley really dead, after all? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Drawing on real-life tragedies, Perrin creates an unforgettable and chilling tale of the seamy side of an island paradise.&quot; - &lt;i&gt;Booklist&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />
