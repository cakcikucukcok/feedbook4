  <title>I&#39;ve Had It - Rote Writer</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;In Lucifer&amp;rsquo;s mind, there are legions of demons bound to his will. His will is to unleash the hell humans have created with all their wrongs on earth so that everyone gets their due. His rue shall be done come kingdom come.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His will is to right all wrongs including his own. To return to heaven and to make heaven a place on earth. After all he&amp;rsquo;s not just the Lord of Hell, he&amp;rsquo;s also been given dominion over earth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Heaven would have come down long before had not humans created such a hell on earth. Human population now reaching exponential growth, has in turn churned many more ready to be burned in hell. With so many, hell is now like an overflowing well of worms. There&amp;rsquo;s no more room. Not even for the likes of Lucifer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With no room to grow, many are now lost to live in limbo. Imagine a room, a train car; better yet a cave or cavernous vault, with so many people stuffed inside there&amp;rsquo;s no room to move. Just squirming like worms, like maggoty meat deep in hell&amp;rsquo;s heat. The stink and stench, the scratching and scraping, the screaming and scheming is sickening.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And this is just limbo... hell is a hell of a lot worse, with the gnashing and biting; faces defaced, clawed raw with the misery, the maw. The worms, the germs, the bacteria and diarrhoea with no sleep or place to keep. The insanity, the lost vanity; the cruel rule of hell&amp;rsquo;s fuel for all to feel will reel those responsible for their actions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The popes, priests and pastors in the past responsible for burning witches at stakes now in turn burn in an internal, infernal and eternal hell. The bloody battles, inquisitions and spurious suspicions will now have jurisdiction forever over those responsible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A perpetual nightmare is what&amp;rsquo;s to come for those who have done wrong in the name of the Lord.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those who have killed, maimed in the name of the Lord, for money or for possession now find themselves killed, maimed in the same form or fashion or forever stressed with being obsessed with the emptiness of the need for greed. Those who have suffered others now suffer the same fate. There is no escape, no way to wash away the wrong.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is what awaits those with ill fates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lucifer has no choice but to incarnate to what abates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s no such thing as a clean slate. Only fools think forgiveness leaves them free to go on another killing spree. Those who think the Lord suffered for them sickens Lucifer. Only the damnable would send someone else in their stead to suffer for them. The Lord as Lucifer knows Him now, would be the first one to damn any who would want Him to suffer such a fate for any. The Lord did not pay the price willingly. He sure as shit doesn&amp;rsquo;t want to spend an eternity so that a rapist, murderer or pedophile can get off scot-free if they just believe in the Lord. The Lord will not suffer anymore sins or for the sins of the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lucifer is on the Lord&amp;rsquo;s side. He&amp;rsquo;s seen what humans would have Him suffer. It&amp;rsquo;s beyond sickening. To think popes, priests and pastors who preach His suffering as something special shows how sadistic the species has become bent on something heaven sent. A religion based on belief is the bane to anything humane.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Who in the world would have created such a scheme but those who have blood on their hands. Those who don&amp;rsquo;t want to burn in hell. Those well aware of what awaits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The end to all things &amp;nbsp;are set forth in this novel understanding of the New Testament. The Book of Revelation will not pass according to scripture or rapture but by the laws of the universe. The gradual decline of order along with the inertia of all human behavior will usher in the Apocalypse.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;" />
