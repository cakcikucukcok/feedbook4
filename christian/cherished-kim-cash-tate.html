  <title>Cherished - Kim Cash Tate</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;&lt;B&gt;Before healing can begin for Kelli and Heather, they need to believe they are worth cherishing.&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/P&gt; &lt;P&gt;Kelli London once dreamed of being a songwriter. As crazy as it seemed, she hoped that God would use the lyrics that came to her even while she slept. She dreamed about Brian too, that the love they shared as high-school students would grow into marriage. But choices that still haunt her destroyed those dreams. Until now—when a series of love letters reawakens her hope for the future.&lt;/P&gt; &lt;P&gt;Heather Anderson&#39;s life has spun out of control—first, an affair with a married man, then a one-night stand with the drummer of a popular Christian band has left her devastated. Broken and alone, she cried out to the only One able to save her. He met her there, but it was just the beginning. Because now she must take a different path. And the one God has planned for her looks nothing like the one she envisioned.&lt;/P&gt; &lt;P&gt;As Kelli and Heather awaken to their true worth, they find the freedom to pursue their dreams—and relationships—based on the security of knowing God&#39;s unconditional love.&lt;/P&gt;" />
