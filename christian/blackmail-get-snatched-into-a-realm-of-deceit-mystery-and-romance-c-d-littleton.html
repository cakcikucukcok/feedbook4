      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;BlackMail is set in the dirty south where everybody&amp;#39;s a hustler. Leroy &amp;quot;Blue&amp;quot; Powers is snatched back into a&amp;nbsp;life of&amp;nbsp;crime he swore he&amp;#39;d left behind. His savage return to his former gangsta lifestyle, is provoked when Blue finds himself framed for murder and blackmailed into committing several gruesome crimes. Blue goes along in order to keep himself, and the ones he loves, alive and from behind bars.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What the blackmailer didn&amp;#39;t count on was Blue&amp;#39;s cunning mind and crime boss connections. Blue is determined to find out who framed him... and to return the favor.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With his down ass chick, Taiesha, and his down for what-ever cousin, Gotit, riding with him, Blue is ready for war. But, never did he image the tragedies that would unfold as he follows the trail of deceit.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;BlackMail isn&amp;#39;t your typical &amp;quot;Hood&amp;quot; storyline, the plots will keep you guessing until the end and the racy romance scenes will leave you squirming and have you reading them over and over.&lt;/p&gt;" />
