  <title>Fifty Shades of Trae - Charli Li</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;There are undoubtedly, Fifty Shades of Trae, and I am well aware of over half of them. Until now, I&amp;rsquo;ve never found the need or urge to record my most private thoughts or sentiments. In my diary and on these pages, I write from the very heart, sharing my most intimate feelings. These pages are my calm in the middle of the storm that I call Trae. Trae is an asshole, excellent lover, amazing person, family man, cold-blooded killer, fearless, crazy, calm, calculating, stubborn, handsome . . . you get my point. Sometimes Trae makes me feel like more than a woman, and at other times he makes me feel less than human. But I will make him love me, if it&amp;rsquo;s the last thing I do. However, I had to get this off my chest and get some things straight for the record. This diary entry by an obsessed Charli Li, also intertwines with &amp;lsquo;The Letters&amp;rsquo; that are a part of Wahida Clark&amp;rsquo;s Thug Series.&lt;/p&gt;" />
