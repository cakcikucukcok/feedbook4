  <title>A Perfect Secret - Kelly Long</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Nineteen-year-old Rose Bender is a bridal attendant for Priscilla King&amp;rsquo;s upcoming wedding and has recently become engaged to handsome but sober, Luke Lantz.&amp;nbsp;Rose and Luke have known each other since childhood and their families have both joked about a possible union in recent years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Luke asks her to marry him, Rose agrees out of a sense of duty and a willingness to settle for solid friendship as a basis for the engagement. But, as she witnesses Priscilla&amp;rsquo;s excitement, despite a trail of mishaps leading to the wedding, Rose begins to wonder if there shouldn&amp;rsquo;t be more to a relationship.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rose begins to examine Luke and his life more closely, and she&amp;rsquo;s amazed when she stumbles upon an exciting, secret side of him. But what if she isn&amp;rsquo;t as adventurous as Luke expects? The Lord will whisper to Rose and Luke that they both have much to offer that&amp;rsquo;s worth the telling in &lt;em&gt;A Perfect Secret.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />
