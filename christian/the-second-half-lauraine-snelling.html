  <title>The Second Half - Lauraine Snelling</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;&lt;b&gt;Bestselling author Lauraine Snelling shares a heartfelt story of a couple who put their plans for a peaceful retirement on hold to assume guardianship of their young grandchildren. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;Mona and Ken Sorenson are approaching the best years of their lives. Mona&#39;s greatest concern is that Ken will learn of the surprise party she&#39;s planning for his retirement from his job as Dean of Students at Stone University. They&#39;ve already been making plans to travel, spend limitless hours in the garden, and Ken is looking forward to working on his woodworking and fishing with his grandchildren. It&#39;s what they deserve after years of careful planning. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;div&gt;But things begin to unravel when Ken learns that office politics are about to destroy his department. Can he really just leave, abandoning the work he spent a lifetime achieving? Mona is eager to build her event planning business with Ken&#39;s help, but rather than supporting her, he expresses concern that the stress of the work will send her back into the depression she struggles with. &lt;/div&gt; &lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div&gt;Then, just days before Ken&#39;s last official day of work, their son, a Special Forces officer in the Army, learns he&#39;s being immediately deployed on a six-month mission in Pakistan. Since his wife left him, the only people he trusts to care for his two young children are his parents. In an instant, everything Ken and Mona spent their lives planning changes, and they will need to find strength, both physical and mental, to become parents once more. This is not the second half they wanted, and when their son fails to contact them as planned, they struggle to trust that it is God&#39;s plan, not theirs, that matters most.&lt;/div&gt;" />
