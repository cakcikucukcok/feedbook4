  <title>Finding the Magic: A Novella - Jack Lewis Baillot</title>
      <meta name="description" content="In 1940s London during World War II, teenager Belle Maurice is sent to the London countryside to escape the bombings in the city. She knows she will miss her mother and worry about her father, who is away fighting in the war, but she has no idea what awaits her in the manor where she is to live. She finds friends with the staff, but the mysterious and elusive master of the house, Mr. Prince, frightens her. What would she make of this man, who appeared only for dinner and disappeared into his room at other times? Would he be like the dreaded Bluebeard in Beauty and the Beast, bringing girls to his mansion only to kill them in a cellar? Should she steer clear of him, or reject her fear and reach out to him? Having prayed that God would help her see the beauty in the world and other people, she knew she had a daunting dilemma.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Finding the Magic is a novella that poses a question: Can Belle teach Mr. Prince to find the magic in a world where all magic seems to be long gone?&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
