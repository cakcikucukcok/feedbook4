  <title>Crime Plus Politics - Gary Phillips</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Noir meets diversity and transforms the genre into an over-the-top, transcendental psychedelic thriller ride of pulpy goodness in Three Rooms Press’ upcomingT HE OBAMA INHERITANCE, a collection of fifteen stories of conspiracy noir curated by editor and award-winning African-American crime novelist Gary Phillips.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
In the tradition of satirical works of Swift and Twain, with nods to the likes of Asimov and Philip K. Dick, these tales contain time traveling secret agents, Supreme Court judges who can clone themselves, kung fu’ing androids out for justice, and a race of ancient lizard people and their true master plan …and these are just the tame ones mashed up in the blender of fake news bots, climate change is but a hoax by the Chinese and humans roamed with dinosaurs. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
In an era where the outlandish and fantastic has permeated our media 24/7, where mind-bending conspiracy theories shape our views, THE OBAMA INHERITANCE writers riff on the numerous fictions spun about the 44th president of the U.S. Although Obama himself does not appear in most of these stories, contributors spin deliberately outlandish and fantastic twists on many of the dozens of screwball, bizarro conspiracy theories floated about the president during his years in office and turn them on their heads.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
THE OBAMA INHERITANCE editor Gary Phillips is a critically acclaimed author of mystery and graphic novels (The Darker Mask, Bangers, Violent Spring). Raised in South Central Los Angeles, Phillips draws on his experiences from anti-police abuse community organizing and anti-apartheid activism in his work. He was the chair of the Eleanor Taylor Bland Crime Fiction Writers of Color committee, and was president of the Private Eye Writers of America.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Contributors include famed African-American crime/detective author Walter Mosley, former author and Department of Justice attorney Christopher Chambers (Sympathy for the Devil), noir author and screenwriter Johnny Shaw (Dove Season), actor and novelist Danny Gardner (A Negro and an Ofay), former Maine assistant attorney general Kate Flora (Death in Paradise), and award-winning Latina playwright and novelist Désirée Zamorano." />
