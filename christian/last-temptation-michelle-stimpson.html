  <title>Last Temptation - Michelle Stimpson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;i&gt;Last Temptation&lt;/i&gt; by Michelle Stimpson was an excellent read. It is a story of temptation, love, lust, anger, and betrayal. Ms. Stimpson writes a fictional novel that is inspirational and full of hope. --Urban Reviews&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Sensible single mother Patricia &quot;Peaches&quot; Miller isn&#39;t about to follow in her mama&#39;s footsteps and become dependent on a man. But when she doesn&#39;t see eye to eye with the man she wants to marry, she knows that returning to a life of girls&#39; nights out, retail therapy, and chocolate peanut clusters just won&#39;t do for her. Then Raphael, her son&#39;s father, steps back into the picture--and clearly his attraction to Peaches is stronger than ever. There&#39;s just one problem. Raphael has already pledged his heart to another woman. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Peaches has been praying for a perfect family for a long time. Deep down she knows this can&#39;t be God&#39;s idea of an answer--but can you blame a girl for hoping? Now, as she battles with temptation, and with her faith, she&#39;s not sure which will win.  .  .&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&quot;Michelle Stimpson will have you laughing, crying and relating to each of her vivid, vocal characters.&quot; --AAMBC Book Reviews&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&quot;Michelle&#39;s characters always have their own vibrant personalities--this one will keep talking in your head long after the book is through!&quot; --Kendra Norman-Bellamy" />
