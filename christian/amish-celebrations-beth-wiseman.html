      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Gift of Sisters&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hannah and Rachel are fraternal twins approaching their sixteenth birthday&amp;mdash;a time when they will be allowed to spread their wings and enjoy their&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;rumschpringe&lt;/em&gt;. The sisters couldn&amp;rsquo;t be more different: Hannah is outgoing and beautiful, while Rachel is shy and withdrawn. And when newcomer Abraham Stoltzfus arrives in Lancaster County, both women fall head over heels for him, each fighting for his affections in their own ways and driving the sisters to turn on each other. Who will Abraham choose? And will Hannah and Rachel reunite after a devastating heartbreak?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;A New Beginning&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rebecca and Noah are in love and about to be baptized. But when Noah decides to enjoy one last night of his&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;rumschpringe&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;a few weeks before the ceremony, he does something that causes Rebecca to reconsider his proposal. As Rebecca and Noah navigate the turn in their relationship, Rebecca must learn to forgive Noah or abandon her dreams of marrying him. If Noah won&amp;rsquo;t forgive himself in time for the baptism, his guilt could cause him to run from his love for Rebecca and leave his community behind.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;A Perfect Plan&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;(previously published in&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;An Amish Wedding&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Priscilla King has been planning to marry Chester Lapp since she was sixteen years old, and when Chester pops the question on Priscilla&amp;rsquo;s nineteenth birthday, wedding plans begin immediately. But everything begins to fall apart as Chester works to build a house for his new bride, only to have one disaster after another occur. Can true love take this couple through the challenges that threaten their union, or will they begin to doubt that they are on the right path, the one God has chosen for them?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;A Christmas Miracle&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mary is twenty-seven years old and already has five young children. Married to her husband at age eighteen, she wasn&amp;rsquo;t quite prepared for motherhood, and exhaustion and frustration are sending her into a downhill spiral as the holidays approach. Too proud and ashamed to ask for help, Mary&amp;rsquo;s situation begins to take a toll on her marriage. But when an elderly man in a red suit and his sidekick elf befriend Mary, showering her with wisdom and advice, she must choose to accept help, learn to cope with her situation, and ultimately find the true meaning of Christmas.&lt;/p&gt;" />
